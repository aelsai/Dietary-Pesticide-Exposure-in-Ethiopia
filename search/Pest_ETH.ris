N2  - Uncontrolled use of pesticides could result in contamination of air, water, food, and ecosystems. This study aimed to determine pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables collected from selected farmlands of southwest Ethiopia from the end of April 2019 until mid of May 2019. The samples were extracted using a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction and clean-up method. Quantitative analysis of four organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) and seven organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were conducted using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. All the fruit and vegetable samples obtained from all sampling sites were contaminated with one or more pesticide residues. Chloroflurenol-methyl was the most predominantly detected OPPs residue in all crop samples obtained from different sampling sites, with a maximum concentration of 0.402 mg kg−1 in potato samples obtained from the Gurafarda site and a minimum value of 0.049 mg kg−1 in onion samples obtained from the South Bench site. Dibutyl chlorendate was the predominant OCPs in all samples, with the minimum value of 0.498 mg kg−1, which was detected in tomato samples collected from the Jamo site, and the maximum concentration of 1.003 mg kg−1 detected in pineapple samples obtained from the North Bench site. Dimethoate concentrations in tomato samples (0.045–0.084 mg kg−1) were above the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the European Union (EU) guidelines (0.01 mg kg−1) but were below the MRLs established by Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) guidelines (0.5 mg kg−1). Relatively high residue concentrations of dibutyl chlorendate and chloroflurenol-methyl were detected in all the samples obtained from all sampling sites. There is widespread use of pesticides for agriculture by the producers in the study area and there is a need for the regular monitoring of pesticide residues.

N2  - Field survey was conducted in south eastern Ethiopia to determine the disease intensity of chocolate spot and rust and to investigate the association of disease intensity (incidence and severity) with environmental factors and crop cultural practices. A total of 280 faba bean fields were surveyed in eight districts, and type of cropping system, weed management practices, crop growth stage, previous crop in the field, and sowing date were recorded. The associations of disease intensity with independent variables were evaluated using logistic regression model. Mean disease incidence of chocolate spot varied from 70.9 to 93.2% in most fields while percentage severity index (PSI) ranged from 10.5 to 47.1%. In a reduced multiple variable model, chocolate PSI ≤ 30% showed high probability of association with mixed cropping system, good weed management practices, late planting, and when faba bean was rotated with vegetables and cereals. The mean disease incidence of faba bean rust was varied from 23.6 to 78.2%, while the mean PSI of rust was varied from 4.8 to 37.9%. In Gasera, Dinsho, and Agarfa districts, poor weed management practices, fields planted in the month of July, and when previous crop was legume had a high probability of association to (>20) rust PSI in a multiple variable reduced model. In contrast, soil types, fertilizer applied, and fungicides sprayed were not associated with disease intensity. The present study has identified cropping system, planting date, previous crop, district, and weed management practices as important variables that influence faba bean chocolate spot and rust epidemics in diversified fields. Therefore, proper weeding management practices, late planting, crop rotation habit, and other related farm practices should be carried out to reduce chocolate spot and rust impact until resistant faba bean genotypes are developed and distributed to the area.

N2  - In this study, the level of selected organophosphorus and organochlorine pesticide residues from water samples of Gilgle Gibe (I) hydroelectric dam reservoir and its potential tributaries, Jimma zone, Ethiopia, was determined by gas chromatography-electron capture detector (GC-ECD). Low density based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (LD-DLLME) using toluene (as extractant) and acetonitrile (as disperser) was used for extraction of pesticide residues from the samples. Calibration curves constructed at six concentration points have good linearity with coefficient of determination (r 2) ranging from 0.995-0.999. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the method which were determined as 3 and 10 times the signal-to-noise ratio were ranging from 0.0001-2.5810 µg/L and 0.0005-8.6050 µg/L, respectively. The efficiency of the method was also evaluated using recovery studies by spiking the water samples with known concentrations of the analytes. The obtained recoveries were ranging from 67-105% with relative standard deviations of 0.79-12.5%. The findings revealed that the studied water samples contain significant amount of the target pesticides, but endrin was not detected in any of the water sample. Methidathion was also detected only in Nada Qalla and Nada Gudda river water samples. The detected residual concentrations of the target pesticides were above the maximum residue limits, except DDT in acute toxic level. The finding indicated that the studied water samples contain considerable amount of the studied residual pesticides that can influence the health of aquatic organisms and other consumers.

N2  - Coffee is a highly consumed and popular beverage all over the world; however, coffee beans used for daily consumption may contain pesticide residues that may cause adverse health effects to consumers. In this monitoring study, the effect of household coffee processing on pesticide residues in coffee beans was investigated. Twelve pesticides, including metabolites and isomers (endosulfan α, endosulfan β, cypermethrin, permethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene, p′p-DDE, p′p-DDD, o′p-DDT, and p′p-DDT) were spiked in coffee beans collected from a local market in southwestern Ethiopia. The subsequent household coffee processing conditions (washing, roasting, and brewing) were established as closely as possible to the traditional household coffee processing in Ethiopia. Washing of coffee beans showed 14.63'57.69 percent reduction, while the roasting process reduced up to 99.8 percent. Chlorpyrifos ethyl, permethrin, cypermethrin, endosulfan α and β in roasting and all of the 12 pesticides in the coffee brewing processes were not detected. Kruskal-Wallis analysis indicated that the reduction of pesticide residues by washing is significantly different from roasting and brewing (P < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between coffee roasting and brewing (P > 0.05). The processing factor (PF) was less than one (PF < 1), which indicates reduction of pesticides under study during processing of the coffee beans. The cumulative effect of the three processing methods has a paramount importance in evaluating the risks associated with ingestion of pesticide residues, particularly in coffee beans.

N2  - Endosulfan, a mixture of α- and β-isomers, is used by farmers in the wet and dry season for khat and onion production. Khat leaf samples were collected in farmer fields at intervals of 1 h; 1, 5, 9 and 14 d after application. The dissipation rate of α- and β-isomers and residue level in khat were compared with residue levels in onion. The extraction was done by using Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) method and analyzed by Gas Chromatography – Electron Capture Detector (GC-ECD). Greater residue α- and β-isomer endosulfan levels were found in khat compared to onion as khat leaves are sprayed repeatedly in two week. Residue levels of khat exceeded the tolerable EU limit of 0.05 mg.kg−1 for leafy vegetables and herbs. For both raw and processed onion sample α- and β-endosulfan residues level were below the tolerable of limit EU regulation for bulb vegetables (i.e. 0. 1 mg.kg−1). The mean half-life for the α-isomer of endosulfan was 3.4 d in the wet season and 3.6 d in the dry season whilst that for the β-isomer was 5.0 d and 5.4 d respectively. Both isomers dissipated fastest in the wet season under conditions of high humidity and precipitation. The β-isomer persisted longer and had a lower dissipation rate from plants surface compared to the α-isomer.

N2  - The laboratory test was conducted in 2016 at Gondar seed laboratory with the objective of evaluating of seed priming, pesticide dressing and coating on germination of sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) on laboratory at Gondar, Ethiopia. Twelve treatments, untreated seed (T1), hydro-primed seed (T2), seed primed with CaCl2 (T3), seed treated with dynamic (T4), hydro-primed seed + treated with dynamic (T5), seed primed with CaCl2+ treated with dynamic (T6), seed treated with dynamic + disco (T7), hydro-primed seed + treated with dynamic + disco (T8), seed primed with CaCl2 + treated with dynamic + disco (T9), seed treated with dynamic + disco +genius coating(T10), hydro-primed seed + treated with dynamic +disco + genius coating(T11) and seed primed with CaCl2 + treated with dynamic + disco + genius coating (T12) were tested using completely randomized design (CRD) with four replications. Physiological quality data like germination percentage, root length, shoot length and vigor index were taken. Analysis of variance for all parameters was computed with SAS version 9.0 and mean separation was using the least significant difference test (LSD) at 5% and 1% level of significance. The study revealed that germination percentage, root length, shoot length and vigor index of sesame were significantly (p < 0.01) affected by seed priming and coating treatments. From this experiment, higher germination percentage (91.50%) was recorded by primed seeds with water. However, the root length (4.78 cm), shoot length (6.33 cm) and vigor index (928.48) of sesame was higher for seeds coated with dynamic + disco.

N2  - Background In Ethiopia, pesticides are widely used for a variety of purposes. The occurrence of contamination and poisoning for farmers is highly reported due to unsafe handling practices and their usage. We assessed knowledge, attitudes and experiences of previous pesticide exposure, and related health problems among farmers who use irrigation in Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among farmers living in the zone. Respondents were 796 irrigation farmers from 20 kebeles (lowest administration unit) in Jimma Zone. Data were collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire via faceto-face interviews. Both descriptive and inferential statistics analysis were performed. A binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with attitudes of farmers towards the safe use of pesticides at P value of ô 0.05 in the final model. Results Among the participants, 54.4% (95%CI, 50.7-58%) knew at least one pesticide control method and 53.7% had positive attitudes towards safe use of pesticide. The mean score of attitudes was found to be 3.9(±0.4). Knowledge including each of the following: the names of the pesticides (AOR, 0.41; 95%CI, 0.25-0.67), methods of pest control and the use of gloves during pesticide exposure (AOR, 1.52; 95%CI, 1.07-2.16) was found to be independent predictor of the farmers' attitudes about safe use of pesticides. Past exposure of pesticide was reported by 89.6% of farmers. Participants reported ingestion (88.9%) and inhalation (90.4%) as possible mechanisms of pesticide exposure. Nearly 42% of farmers had never used any personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect themselves against pesticide exposure. Farmers reported several health complications, which were perceived as complications of pesticide exposure, including: headache, nausea and vomiting, skin rash and irritation and abdominal pain. Conclusions The study exposed the existence of high probability of pesticide exposure, the low safe use of pesticide and the low use of PPE. However, but farmers had positive attitudes towards safe use of pesticides. These findings appeal for the development of effective public health strategies to improve farmers' awareness and safe use of PPE. In addition, there is a need to inform farmers about integrated pest management to prevent severe health complications, which may occur as a result of unsafe and inappropriate use of pesticides.

N2  - A survey of 90 farmers, randomly selected over six sorghum-growing districts in eastern Ethiopia was carried out during July to August, 2001 in the long rainy season. The study investigated farmers' perceptions of the importance of stem-borer and farm practices influencing the pest. Sorghum farming was characterized by smallholdings with an average land size of 4.3 ha, an average family size of 6 and an average yield of 878 kg ha-1. Farmers cited pests, drought, and shortage of seed, land and labour as the main constraints upon sorghum production. Stem-borers were perceived to be the major pests requiring control. The majority of the farmers never applied chemical insecticides against stem-borers due to lack of capital and unavailability of insecticides. Because of restricted access to improved varieties, farmers largely used local cultivars of sorghum selected for yield potential but with little emphasis on insect resistance. Very few farmers destroyed sorghum residues after harvest. The majority of farmers grew sorghum under intercropping mainly due to the high yield expected. Crop rotation in sorghum fields was not widely practised due to land shortage.

N2  - The status of insecticide susceptibility of Anopheles arabiensis populations was monitored in northern and southern Ethiopia using one- to three-day-old mosquitoes reared from larval collections. Anopheles gambiae complex mosquitoes, identified by PCR as An. arabiensis, were exposed to diagnostic concentrations of DDT, malathion, fenitrothion, bendiocarb, propoxur and deltamethrin according to the standard WHO procedure. A heterogeneous and focal distribution of resistance phenotypes was observed in surveyed districts of the country. In Tach Armacho in northern Ethiopia, only resistance to DDT was detected. In the other two northern sites, An. arabiensis populations were susceptible to fenitrothion, resistant to malathion, propoxur and DDT and showed low levels of survival when exposed to bendiocarb requiring further investigations. In three areas of southern Ethiopia, An. arabiensis was susceptible to bendiocarb, propoxur and malathion, with low levels of survival on fenitrothion needing further confirmation. These samples were resistant to DDT and deltamethrin. Analyses for the knockdown resistant (kdr) mutations showed only the L1014F mutation was present with frequencies ranging from 68 to 100 %. The need for routine monitoring and surveillance as part of an insecticide resistance management programme is highlighted.

N2  - Cotton crop Ethiopia is a high-value crop and the strategy for pest control is insecticide-dependent with no consideration of beneficial insects. We carried out a study in 2013 and 2014 to determine the effectiveness of a food spray product developed with local ingredients from Benin (BFP), a food spray product developed from Ethiopian ingredients (EFP), and mixtures of the individual food spray products with and without neem extracts. Applications of BFP and of EFP alone attracted and retained beneficial insects and significantly reduced the number of pests, and increased cotton yields and profitability. The net margins of 18,418 and 18,642 Ethiopian birr (ETB)/ha were achieved from the plots treated with BFP and EFP, respectively, and 13,000 ETB (US$1 = 19 ETB) was achieved from the unsprayed plots. Addition of neem extract to the food spray products decreased the number of beneficial insects attracted to the food spray plots. In conclusion, food sprays can be used as part of integrated pest management (IPM) for managing cotton pests and can result in significant increases in crop yields and profitability.

N2  - Rationale In the last decade, due to expansion of commercial horticultural green houses and irrigated farms the use of pesticides in Ethiopia has increased dramatically (more than 10-fold) leading to potential health risks. Objective To investigate if occupational exposure to pesticides is associated with respiratory symptoms and lung function impairments. Methods and measurements We performed two independent but sequential (2 years apart) cross-sectional surveys. In the first survey we studied respiratory symptoms among 1,104 subjects of which 601 were occupationally exposed to pesticides (applicators and re-entry workers) selected from three commercial farming systems (large scale open farms, large scale greenhouses and small scale irrigated farms) in Ethiopia. In the second survey we performed additionally lung function measurement in 387 subjects of which 206 were occupationally exposed to pesticides (applicator from all the farming systems but only green house re-entry workers). Daily and cumulative lifetime exposure was estimated using detailed exposure algorithms. Main results Significant (p < 0.05) exposure response associations of respiratory symptoms(chronic cough and shortness of breath) and cumulative and daily pesticide exposure estimates were observed in both surveys. We observed a significant increase in risk for chronic cough OR = 3.15 (95% CI: 1.56{\textendash}6.36) and shortness of breath OR = 6.67 (95% CI: 2.60{\textendash}17.58) with exposure status (yes/no) in the first survey. In the second survey symptoms were objectified by significant reductions in FEV1 (140 ml) (95% CI: 30{\textendash}250 ml), FEF 25{\textendash}75 (550 ml) (95% CI: 310{\textendash}800 ml) and risk of FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.8(OR = 4.31) (95% CI: 2.11{\textendash}8.81) with occupational pesticide exposure. Conclusions These findings indicate an increased risk of adverse respiratory health. As workers were young (27 years) with effects occurring within a relative short duration of exposure (4 years) implementation of stringent occupational health measures are warranted.

N2  - Agricultural intensification in sub-Saharan African countries has significantly increased pesticide applications. Information on pesticide residues and their transport in groundwater and streams is needed to properly manage and reduce any harm to the ecosystem and environment. This information is lacking in the volcanic soils of Ethiopian highlands. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess pesticide concentrations in ground and surface water and their risk to humans and aquatic life. The 9 km2 rural watershed Robit Bata in the Lake Tana Basin was selected. Crops were grown under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Pesticide use was assessed, and groundwater samples were collected from eight wells and surface water samples at the outlet twice in the rain phase and once in the dry phase. Samples were analyzed for chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, (α and β) endosulfan, profenofos, NO3−, and pH. Chlorpyrifos and endosulfan, which are strongly adsorbed and slowly degrading pesticides, were found in nearly all surface and groundwater samples, with maximum concentrations in surface water of 8 µg L−1 for chlorpyrifos and 3 µg L−1 endosulfan. Maximum groundwater concentrations were only slightly lower. The weakly adsorbed and fast degrading pesticides, dimethoate, and profenofos were detected only in the rain phase after spraying in the groundwater, indicating preferential transport to groundwater at depths of up to 9 m. The average concentration was 0.38 μg L−1 for dimethoate in surface waters and 1.24 μg L−1 in groundwater. Profenofos was not detected in surface water. In the groundwater, the average concentration was 0.05 μg L−1. Surface water concentrations of chlorpyrifos and endosulfan were highly toxic to fish. The World Health Organization banned these pesticides worldwide. It should be phased out for use in Ethiopia to safeguard the ecological health of Lake Tana, which is rich in biodiversity and endemic fish species.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Farmers in developing countries, including Ethiopia, are exposed to agricultural pesticides, including pesticides that are restricted or banned in developed countries. There is little information available on pesticide use safety practices and associated factors among Ethiopian farmers, particularly in the study area. OBJECTIVE: To assess pesticide use safety practices and associated factors among farmers in Fogera district wetland area, Amhara region, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design that employs quantitative and qualitative methods was used from August 25 to September 30, 2021. Four hundred thirty participants were included by using a stratified random sampling technique. Pre-tested interview questionnaires, observational checklists, and key informant and in-depth interview guides were used to collect data. The quantitative data were collected by face-to-face interviews of farmers, whereas the qualitative data were collected by in-depth interviews of selected farmers and key informant interviews of responsible stalk holders. The data were entered into Epi data version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Bi-variable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the dependent variable. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used as a cut-off point to declare a statistically significant association between factors and outcome variables. The odds ratio and 95% CI were calculated to describe the strength of the association between factors and outcome variables. The qualitative study included 35 respondents from various backgrounds and levels of expertise, which were analyzed using thematic analysis by open-code 4.03 version software. RESULT: The proportion of good pesticide use safety practices in the study area was 24.4% (95% CI: 21.4%-29.3%). Educational status (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.19, 95% CI: 1.44-6.71), experience of pesticide spraying (AOR: 6.85. 95% CI: 2.426-9.35), knowledge of pesticide usage (AOR: 3.40, 95% CI: 1.459-7.855), access to safety materials (AOR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.198-3.536), and ever having received training (AOR: 4.93, 95% CI: 2.88-8.59) were factors associated with good safety practice in pesticide use. Qualitatively, limited material access, lack of government attention, insufficient training opportunities, absence of media coverage, weak enforcement of laws, and limited guideline access barred good safety practices for pesticide use. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that good safety practices were low in the study area. Being educated, having experience with pesticide spraying, having good knowledge of pesticide usage, having access to safety materials, and having received pesticide use training all increased the likelihood of good pesticide use practice. Insufficient training opportunities and material access, weak law enforcement, limited access to guidelines, and a shortage of media coverage were challenges identified qualitatively.

N2  - Background: Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is one of the most important crops in Ethiopia for international market, while its production is challenged by insect infestations and inappropriate agronomic practices. Sesame webworm (Antigastra catalaunalis) is the major pest, which causes heavy losses in Humera areas, Northern Ethiopia. This study aims to determine optimum sowing time and insecticide application frequency for controlling A. catalaunalis. Results: The results showed that the early sowing gave minimum infestation of sesame webworm and better sesame grain yield. The integration of early sowing and weekly spray (T16) resulted in low incidence (8.8%) and higher grain yield (651 kg/ha), where the combination of late sowing and untreated (control) plot (T3) gave higher incidence (100%) and lower grain yield (69.1 kg/ha). The maximum level of leaf, flower and capsule damage was scored on the late sowing and untreated plot, while the lowest was in the early sowing and weekly sprayed plot. Conclusions: Planting sesame early on the onset of rainfall followed with two application of insecticide at 2 and 4 weeks after emergence was found economical and optimum management option for controlling A. catalaunalis.

N2  - An adequate food supply is widely recognized as a necessary condition for social development as well as a basic human right. Food deficits are especially common among semi-subsistence farming households in eastern and southern Africa and farm productivity is widely regarded as the locus for enhancing household food outcomes. However, knowledge gaps surrounding benefits associated with climate smart, productivity-enhancing technologies require attention. This study evaluates benefits associated with sustainable intensification farm management practices (crop residue retention, minimum tillage, manure application and use of herbicides, pesticides, fertilizer, and improved seeds) for household calorie and protein supplies and demonstrates their scope across households with high-, moderate- and low- likelihoods of calorie and protein deficits. Household-level calorie and protein deficits were estimated from survey data on food production, acquisition and consumption for households in Ethiopia and Mozambique. Multinomial logistic models were used to identify drivers of household food deficit status and logistic model trees established “rules of thumb” to classify households by food deficit status as low, moderate or high likelihood. In Ethiopia, especially wet seasons were associated with a high likelihood of a food deficit while especially dry seasons were associated with a high likelihood of food deficit in Mozambique. The practices associated with sustainable intensification and related technologies substantially enhanced food outcomes in groups with a high- and a low-likelihood of food deficit, and associated benefits were high for the best-off households. Benefits associated with sustainable intensification technologies were not observed for households with a moderate likelihood of a food deficit and some technologies even increased risk. The sustainable intensification practices assessed here were associated with improved food outcomes yet benefits were limited in scope for households of intermediate status. Thus, there is a need to expand the technical options available to reduce food deficit.

N2  - This study analyses the economics of conservation tillage (CT) with respect to its effect on maize yield and chemical fertiliser, herbicide, and female and male labour demand. We estimate production and input demand functions using seemingly unrelated regressions on plot-level cross-sectional farm household data collected in the north-west of Ethiopia. A two-step control function is applied to address potential endogeneity bias due to the inclusion of the CT adoption decision as an explanatory variable. Our results show that CT increases maize yield and chemical fertiliser demand. Additionally, the results show that the adoption of CT reduces female and male labour required for crop production. However, this is achieved through the increased use of herbicides, which might have an undesirable health and environmental effects.

N2  - Garlic (Allium sativum) is a favourite spice in Ethiopia that is widely cultivated and used as food and in medicine. This experiment was carried out for seven months in 2007. Some Trichoderma species were isolated from the soil in infected Allium sativum farms in three villages in Ambo, Ethiopia and identified. Internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1-2) of rDNA and the translation elongation factor 1-α (eEF1a1) were generated from the isolates obtained using an ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The species of fungi were further evaluated for their activity against Sclerotium cepivorum using Weller’s and dual culture methods. AS1, AST1 and GS2 were identified as Trichoderma tomentosum, AS2 as Hypocrea lixii and GS1 as Trichoderma afroharzianum. AS1, AS2 and GS2 parasitised S. cepivorum and inhibited the growth of the pathogen while ATS1 and GS1 parasitised the pathogen only. AS1 showed the strongest significant antibiosis of 3.75 mm while the significantly least antibiosis was by GS2. GS1 showed 100% parasitism on the 7th day of incubation. These Trichoderma species inhibited the growth of the pathogens and can be useful in the production of fungicide for the control of white rot disease of garlic.

N2  - To the Editor: Bartonella quintana is a body louse–borne human pathogen that can cause trench fever, bacillary angiomatosis, endocarditis, chronic bacteremia, and chronic lymphadenopathy (1). Recently, B. quintana DNA was detected in lice collected from the heads of poor and homeless persons from the United States, Nepal, Senegal, Ethiopia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in nits in France (2,3). The head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis, and the body louse, Pediculus humanus humanus, are obligatory ectoparasites that feed exclusively on human blood (4). Outside of their habitats, the 2 ecotypes are morphologically indistinguishable (1). Sequence variation in the PHUM540560 gene discriminates between head and body lice by determining the genotype of the lice (5). While surveying for trench fever among homeless persons in shelters in Marseille, France during October 2012–March 2013, we investigated the presence of B. quintana DNA in nits, larvae, and adult lice collected from mono-infested and dually infested persons and determined the genotypes of the specimens.  The persons included in this study received long-lasting insecticide-treated underwear; lice were collected by removing them from clothing, including underwear, pants, and shirts. Because body lice reside in the clothing of infested persons except when feeding, they are sometimes called clothing lice.  A total of 989 specimens were tested, including 149 (83 from clothing and 66 from hair) first–instar larvae hatched in the laboratory from eggs collected from 7 dually infested persons, and 840 adult body lice collected from the clothing of 80 mono-infested patients. We included DNA isolated from 3 nits collected from the hair of a mono-infested person who had previously been confirmed as positive for B. quintana (6) (Table).    Table  Distribution of Bartonella quintana DNA in nits, larvae, and adult body lice collected from hair and clothing of homeless persons in shelters, Marseille, France, October 2012– March 2013*    Total DNA was extracted by using an EZ1 automated extractor (QIAGEN, Courtaboeuf, France) and subjected twice to real-time PCR specific for B. quintana. The first PCR targeted the 16S-23S intergenic spacer region. Positive samples were confirmed by using a second real-time PCR targeting the yopP gene (6). Samples that tested positive for B. quintana DNA were analyzed by multiplex real-time PCR that targeted the PHUM540560 gene (5). We used head and body lice that had known genotypes positive controls. Negative controls were included in each assay.  Of the hatched larvae, 5 (6%) of the 83 recovered from clothing and 7 (11%) of 66 from the hair (Table) of 4 of the 7 dually infested persons were positive for B. quintana DNA (Technical Appendix). Of the 840 adult body lice, 174 (21%) collected from 42 (53%) of 80 of the mono-infested persons contained B. quintana DNA (Table, Technical Appendix). The multiplex real-time PCR that targeted the PHUM540560 gene clearly identified all nits, larvae, and adult lice as belonging to the body lice lineage. Negative controls remained negative in all PCR-based experiments.  For 2 decades, B. quintana DNA has been regularly detected in lice collected from the heads of persons living in poverty, but it had not been detected in head lice that infest schoolchildren (7,8). All of the lice collected during this study that tested positive for B. quintana from homeless persons were body lice, including some that were recovered from hair. This observation supports our assertion that body lice are not confined to the body. The 3 eggs that were removed from the hair of a mono-infested homeless person whose samples tested positive for B. quintana were also body lice. During the clinical examination, no adult head lice or adult body lice were found on that person, confirming that the patient had been heavily infested with body lice in the past, not head lice. The nits were most likely laid by body lice that migrated toward the patient’s head. When a member of this research team (DR) collected the eggs from the hair shaft, they were found ≈3–3.5 cm from the hair follicle. Because hair grows ≈1.25 cm per month, the louse infestation occurred ≈3 months before egg collection (6).  Homeless persons that we have monitored for many years are often heavily infested by body lice but are also occasionally infested with head lice. Before genetic tools that differentiate the head and body louse lineages were available (5), it was speculated that body lice may have originated from head lice (9). From our study, it is clear that under conditions of massive infestation, body lice can migrate and colonize hair; the opposite may also be true. However, there is no evidence that body lice are capable of causing an outbreak of lice living on the head, as happens among schoolchildren that have been found to be infested only by head lice. This suggests that body lice cannot thrive in the environment of head lice, which infest millions of children worldwide (10), further suggesting that outbreaks of trench fever are most likely not linked to head lice in industrialized countries. In conclusion, by analyzing lice harvested from the heads and clothing of homeless persons, we have shown that the 2 ecotypes belong to the same body lice population.

N2  - ABSTRACT&#x0D; Finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L) commonly known as ragi is an important crop used for food, forage and industrial products. Finger millet has a wide ecological and geographical adaptability and resilience to various agro-climatic adversities hence, it is highly suited to drought condition and marginal land and requires low external input in cultivation.. Farmers participatory field demonstrations of ragi variety Arjun and Bhairabi were conducted at two villages ie Pedawada of Malkangiri block and MPV -1 of Kalimela block of Malkangiri district, comprising 40 farmers in cluster approach in Kharif 2018 and 2019 , by Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Malkangiri , in South Eastern Ghat Zone of Odisha . Conducting front line demonstrations on farmer’s field help to identify the constraints and potential of the finger millet in the specific area as well as it helps in improving the economic and social status of the farmers. Observation on growth and yield parameters were taken and economic analysis was done. The final seed yield was recorded at the time of harvest and the gross return in (Rs ha -1) was calculated based on prevailing market prices. The results from the demonstration conclusively proved that finger millet variety Arjun (OEB-526) recorded the higher yield ( 18.8 q ha-1) , followed by Bhairabi ( 15.3 q ha-1) and farmer’s traditional variety Nali Mandia ( Dasaraberi) recorded an average yield of (8.6 q ha-1 ) . HYV Finger millet variety Arjun with proper nutrient management and plant protection measures gave 118 % higher over farmer’s practices. The technological and extension gap was 1.9 q ha-1 and 12.07 q ha-1 respectively. Similarly, technological index was 8.2 percent. The benefit cost ratio was 2.4 and 1.9 in case of Arjun and Bhairabi respectively and in case of farmer’s variety Nali Mandia it was 1.4. Hence the existing local finger millet variety can be replaced by HYV Arjun ans Bhairabi , since it fits good to the existing rainfed farming situation for higher productivity. By conducting front line demonstrations on millet on large scale in farmer’s field, yield potential of finger millet can be enhanced largely which will increase in the income level of farmers and improve the livelihood condition of the farming community.&#x0D; Introduction&#x0D; Among small millets, finger millet (Elusine coracana L,) locally known as Ragi/Mandia is the most important crop grown in tribal districts of Odisha and it is the staple food of the tribals. It was originated about 5000 years ago in east Africa (possibly Ethiopia) and was introduced into India, 3000 years ago (Upadhyaya et al., 2006) and it is highly suited to drought condition and marginal land and requires low external input in cultivation. Millet is a collective term referring to a number of small seeded annual grasses that are cultivated as grain crops, primarily on marginal lands in dry areas in temperate, subtropical and tropical regions (Baker, 1996). Nutritionally finger millet is superior to major cereal crops and rich source of micronutrients such as calcium, phosphorous, magnesium and iron. And it has several health benefits. Finger millet grains contain higher amount of proteins, oils and minerals than the grains of rice, maize or sorghum (Reed et al., 1976). Vadivoo and Joseph (1998) mentioned finger millet grains contain 13.24% moisture, 7.6% protein, 74.36% carbohydrate, 74.36% carbon, 1.52% dietary fiber, 2.35% minerals, 1.35% fat and energy 341.6 cal/100g. (Joshi and Katoch, 1990; Ravindran, 1991). It is a rich source of micronutrients such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and iron. Cysteine, tyrosine, tryptophan and methionine are the right spectrum of amino acids found in finger millet protein (Rachie, 1975). The increase in global temperature leads to climate changes that directly affect crop production and increase people's hunger and malnutrition around the world.. With regard to protein (6-8%) and fat (1-2%) it is comparable to rice and with respect to mineral and micronutrient contents it is superior to rice and wheat (Babu et al., 1987). It is also known for several health benefits such as anti-diabetic, anti-tumerogenic, atherosclerogenic effects, antioxidant, which are mainly attributed due to its polyphenol and dietary fiber contents. Being indigenous minor millet it is used in the preparation of various foods both in natural and malted forms. Grains of this millet are converted into flours for preparation of products like porridge, puddings, pancakes, biscuits, roti, bread, noodles, and other snacks. Besides this, it is also used as a nourishing food for infants when malted and is regarded as wholesome food for diabetic's patients. Diversification of food production must be encouraged both at national and household level in tandem with increasing yields. Growing of traditional food crops suitable for the area is one of the possible potential successful approaches for improving household food security. Malkangiri is one of the seven districts where a flagship programme called “Special Programme for Promotion of Millets in Tribal Areas of Odisha (hereafter, Odisha Millets Mission, (OMM)” has been launched by Department of Agriculture and Farmers Empowerment, Odisha in order to revive millets in rainfed farming systems and household consumption. It was started in kharif 2017 in four blocks of the district, namely Chitrakonda, Korkunda, Mathili and Khairiput. The Government of Odisha launched Odisha Millets Mission (OMM) also known as the Special Programme for Promotion of Millets in Tribal Areas of Odisha in 2017 to revive millets in farms and on plates. The aim was to tackle malnutrition by introducing millets in the public distribution system (PDS) and other state nutrition schemes. The focus is on reviving millets in farms and putting it on plates.”&#x0D; Millet, a nutritious and climate-resilient crop, has traditionally been cultivated and consumed by tribal communities in the rainfed regions of southern Odisha. Technology gap, i.e. poor knowledge about newly released crop production and protection technologies and their management practices in the farmers’ fields is a major constraint in Ragi production. So far, no systematic approach was implemented to study the technological gap existing in various components of Ragi cultivation. Awareness of scientific production technology like HYV of ragi, seed treatment with fungicide, use of insecticide and bio-fertilizers, is lacking in Malkangiri district which were a key reason for low productivity. The production potential could be increased by adopting recommended scientific and sustainable management production practices with improved high yielding varieties and timely use of other critical inputs.&#x0D; Objective&#x0D; The field experiment was undertaken to study the performance of three finger millet varieties Local Mandia (Nali Mandia), Bhairabi and Arjun in rainfed upland situation in kharif season. The present investigation was undertaken to evaluate the field performance of newly released finger millet varieties Arjun and Bhairabi under rainfed condition. The demonstrations were carried out in Malkangiri district covering two villages like Pedawada and MPV-6 to find out the existing technological and extension gap along with technology index with an objective to popularize the ragi varieties having higher yield potential.&#x0D; Material and methods&#x0D; The study was carried out in operational area of Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), Malkangiri during Kharif season in the year 2018 and 2019. The study was under taken in Malkangiri and Kalimela blocks of Malkangiri district of Odisha and the blocks were selected purposefully as Finger millet is the major cereals crop grown in large area in Kharif season. The demonstrations were conducted in two different adopted villages Pedawada and MPV-6 in cluster approach. The Front Line Demonstration (FLD) is an applied approach to accelerate the dissemination of proven technologies at farmer’s fields in a participatory mode with an objective to explore the maximum available resources of crop production and also to bridge the productivity gaps by enhancing the production in national basket.The necessary steps for selection of site and farmers and layout of demonstrations etc were followed as suggested by Choudhary (1999). Forty numbers front line demonstrations on HYV Ragi were conducted in two clusters comprising 40 numbers of farmers. All the participating farmers were trained on various aspects of Ragi production technologies and recommended agronomic practices and certified seeds of Ragi variety Arjun and Bhairabi were used for demonstration. The soil of demonstration site was slightly acidic in reaction (pH-5.0 to 5.25) with sandy loam in texture and EC was 0.134 (dS m −1). The available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was between 214 .00, 22 .00, 142 .00 (Kg ha−1) respectively with 0.48 (%) Organic Carbon. The crop was sown in under rainfed condition in the first to second week of July. The crop was raised with recommended agronomic practices and harvested within 4th week of November up to 2nd week of December.&#x0D; Krishi Vigyan Kendra ( KVK), Malkangiri conducted front line demonstration with HYV varieties like Bhiarabi and Arjun and farmer’ local var Dasaraberi as check Finger millet Variety Arjun (OEB-526) is having Maturity duration 110 days and average yield 20.7q/ha with moderate resistance to leaf, neck and finger blast and brown seed and Bhairabi is a HYV of Ragi with Maturity duration 110 days and average yield 17.6 q/ha. Moderate resistance to leaf, neck blast and brown seeded and protein content 81%. Local variety Dsaraberi or Nali Mandia is having 105 days duration and drought tolerant variety used as farmers variety as local check .&#x0D; The technologies demonstrated were as follows: Popularization of high yielding Ragi variety, Seed treatment with Trichoderma viride @ 4g kg-1 seed , Line sowing with, soil test based fertilizer application along with need based plant protection measures. The field was ploughed two times and planking was done after each plugging, Need based plant protection measures were taken; along with soil test based fertilizer application was done with fertilizer dose 40:30:60 kg. N: P2O5: K2O kg ha -1. In case of local checks existing practices being used by farmers were followed. The observations were recorded for various parameters of the crop. The farmers’ practices were maintained in case of local checks. The field observations were taken from demonstration plot and farmer’s plot as well. Parameters like Plant height, number of fingers per plant, length of finger , no of fingers per year, 1000 seed weight and seed yield were recorded at maturity stage and the gross returns (Rs ha -1 ) were calculated on the basis of prevailing market price of the produce. The extension gap, technology gap, technology index along with B: C ratio was calculated and the data were statistically analyzed applying the statistical techniques. Statistical tools such as percentage, mean score, Standard deviation, co-efficient of variation, Fisher‘s “F” test, were employed for analysis of data. The farmer’s practices (FP) plots were maintained as local check for comparison study. The data obtained from intervention practices (IP) and famers practices (FP) were analyzed for extension gap, technological gap, technological index and benefit cost ratio study as per (Samui et al., 2000) as given below.&#x0D; Technology gap = Pi (Potential yield) - Di (Demonstration yield)&#x0D; Extension gap = Di (Demonstration Yield) - Fi (Farmers yield)&#x0D; Technology index = X 100&#x0D; Result and Discussion&#x0D; The results obtained from the present investigation are summarized below. The Table 1 depicts the major differences observed between demonstration package and farmer’s practices in ragi production in the study area. The major differences were observed between demonstration package and farmer’s practices were regarding recommended varieties, seed treatment, soil test based fertilizer application, keeping optimum plant population by thinning, weed management and plant protection measures. &#x0D; The data of Table 1 shows that under the demonstrated plot only recommended high yielding variety, proper weeding and optimum plant population maintaining by thinning and the farmers used herbicides and the farmers timely performed all the other package and practices. It was also observed that farmers were unaware about balanced fertilizer application, seed treatment, and use of fertilizers application and maintenance of plant population for enhancing the yield. Majority of the farmers in the study area were unaware about use of weed management practices. The findings are in corroborated with the findings of (Katar et al., 2011)&#x0D; From the Table 2 it was revealed that in the district Malkangiri the productivity of finger millet was 6.38 (q ha-1) as compare to state average productivity 8.67 (q ha-1), but there exists a gap between potential yield and farmers yield, which can be minimized by adoption High yielding varieties with improved management practices. The productivity of finger millet was very low in the district as the crop is mostly grown along the hillsides on sloppy land on light textured soil. It was also coupled with negligence in adoption of improved varieties no input like fertilizers use and no plant protection measures and improper method and time of sowing. However, there is a wide gap between the Potential and the actual production realized by the farmers due to partial adoption of recommended package of practices by the growers. Several constraints contributed to yield fluctuation on Ragi production, including: unreliable rainfall; lack of high yielding variety ,disease tolerant varieties; pests and diseases incidence; low producer prices; poor agronomic practices; and lack of institutional support (Bucheyeki et al., 2008; Okoko et al., 1998). One of the central problems of ragi production and processing in this district is due to an uncertain production environment owing to rain fed cultivation, the low resource base of smallholder farmers and processors, and no scope for post harvest management and value addition facilities and poor marketing facility.&#x0D; The results clearly indicated from the Table 3 that the positive effects of FLDs over the existing practices. HYV Ragi Arjun recorded higher yield 18.8(q ha-1) followed by Bhairabi 15.53 (q ha-1) which was 21 % more and the yield performance of these two HYV varieties was higher than the farmer’s variety. This is due to higher of panicle length, more number of tillers and more number of fingers per panicle in HYV of ragi as compared to local variety. The results are in conformity with the findings of (Tomar et al. , 2003). The results clearly indicated the positive effects of FLDs over the existing practices towards enhancing the productivity.&#x0D; It is revealed form table 4 that, as the calculated ‘F’ value at α=0.05 level was found to be larger than table value, indicating significant difference in yield between farmer’s variety and recommended varieties. There was significant difference between average yield of ragi under Farmers practice (FP) and Recommended practice (RP) in variety Arjun under this demonstration. It was concluded that the yield of these HYV ragi varieties was significantly higher as compared to farmer’s variety. &#x0D; The economics and B:C ratio of farmers practice and Demonstration practice has been presented in Table 6. From the table it was revealed that Benefit: Cost ratio (B:C) was recorded to be higher under demonstrations against control treatments during all the years of experimentation. The cost of cultivation in HYV variety was higher due to more labour cost involved in transplanting and also it included cost of fertilizers and plant protection chemicals and also net returns was higher as compared to farmer’s practice. The B: C ratio was found to be 2.4 in case of variety Arjun as compared to 1.9 in case of variety Bhairabi.&#x0D; The results on economic analysis indicated that HYV ragi Arjun and Bhairabi performed better than local variety Ragi. The HYV variety Arjun recorded higher gross return upto Rs 54,332 and followed by Bhairabi Rs 44,289 per ha which was significantly higher than farmers practice and it was due to higher productivity of varieties under demonstration.&#x0D; Conclusion &#x0D; The results revealed that in Malkangiri district finger millet variety Arjun rerecorded highest yield followed by Variety Bhirabi with proper package and practices under rainfed upland condition. From the above study it was concluded that use of finger millet varieties like Arjun or Bhairabi with scientific methods and technological practices of can reduce the technological gap and enhance the productivity in the district. Yield improvement in Finger Millet in the demonstration was due to use of HYV seed and scientific management practices adopted by the farmers. Yield of Finger Millet can be increased to a great extent by conducting effective front line demonstrations in larger area with proven technologies. Finger millet is one of future smart food crop of India and can be grown in the drought condition. This crop is rich in nutrient for food insecurity and within few years because of increase in population of world and depletion of area of production.. The principal reasons of lower productivity of finger millet in the district Malkangiri were lack of knowledge among the farmers about cultivation of HYV finger millet varieties and improper fertilization, late season sowing and severe weed infestation in crop at critical stages. From the above findings, it can be concluded that use of scientific methods of Finger millet cultivation can reduce the technology gap to a considerable extent thus leading to increased productivity of millets in the district. Moreover, extension agencies in the district need to provide proper technical support to the farmers through different educational and extension methods to reduce the extension gap for better production.&#x0D; Acknowledgments&#x0D; The OUAT Bhubaneswar and ICAR-ATRI Kolkata, is acknowledged for financial support to the research program.&#x0D; Conflicts of interest&#x0D; The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.&#x0D; References:&#x0D; &#x0D; Babu, B.

N2  - Welcome to the first issue of World Water Policy Journal for 2025. In this issue, we bring you another 21 contributions from around the world, including 1 guest editorial, 16 research articles, and 4 discussion papers. In practically all regions of the world, we can witness efforts to overcome complex challenges deriving from intersectional issues. Water is not independent of land use, environmental protection, urban development, agriculture, forestry, industrial uses, energy production, and other dimensions. Water is also not a unique and compartmentalized area of government. As we already stated, a couple of years ago, all challenges are interconnected, but our ability to predict, deal with, and adapt to the impact of those changes is not equal to all countries (Camkin and Neto 2022). Neither are the resources to minimize the impacts of climate change, conflict and wars, or migration issues. The world is facing many unbalancing factors that also have consequences for water security. Hegemonic uses of water resources cause unjust suffering and unequal life conditions in many communities. Related to water security, basic human rights to water were discussed at the UN Water Conference in Mar del Plata (1977), followed at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio (1992), and formally recognized by the UN in 2002 as "the right to water as the right of everyone to sufficient, safe, acceptable and physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic uses" (Neto and Camkin 2024). In this unstable world where security threats are increasingly serious, the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all must be ensured for global prosperity and peace (UN 2024). We trust the world will pursue this path of developing better approaches to water policy and water governance. If the lessons of some regions can be heard by others, at least we can keep learning and evolving towards more sustainability. In their guest editorial, Research on the Greening of Water Policy Needs to Move Beyond Supply and Demand-Oriented Logics to Achieve Water Sustainability for All, Franck Poupeau and Brian F. O'Neill reflect on the 10th Water Forum in 2024, recent research and current trends to unpack how supply and demand logics continue to inform policy dominated by "rational" economics. The authors argue that this has not led to the social structural transformations needed around the world, but rather to the re-emphasis of civil engineering exemplified by the rise of new mega-dams, desalination plants and other "new water" initiatives. Drawing lessons from examples including the US (Arizona), France (Paris), and Bolivia (El Alto), where a more precautionary approach was taken, they consider it necessary to rethink public and democratic action to ensure water is distributed in a more widely acceptable, equitable, and less destructive way by reducing the influence of abusive economic forces. The authors conclude that the 10th Water Forum did not seem to pay sufficient attention to the greening of water policy through ecological infrastructure. Building on a theme from our guest editorial, Sandra Megens and Jeroen Warner discuss the recent surge of scholarly interest in exploring the emergence of new governance regimes that redefine the self-governing capacities of local communities in water management while ensuring compliance with central government water laws and regulations in Invisible Threads: Emerging Water Governance in the Multi-Actor Dynamics of the Mira-Mataje Transboundary River Basin. Embracing polycentric governance emphasizes the importance of decentralized, collaborative systems for effectively and sustainably managing water resources. Focusing on actors' interactions around the downstream area of the Mira River basin, which is shared between Columbia and Ecuador, the authors employed a mixed-method approach to gain comprehensive insights into the complex interactions shaping transboundary water governance and community responses. Philamer Torio and Leila Harris focus on the significant role of tariffs for water services to not only achieve operational sustainability and efficiency goals but to also address the requirements of affordability and equity in Water Tariffs and Social Equity: Towards Water Service Connections and Pricing Instruments for the Poor. Noting that even with a well-designed water tariff, the inability of poor households to get piped connections results in the payment of premiums for water that is difficult to access and at times of questionable quality, the authors assess pro-poor projects of three municipal water systems in the Philippines, concluding that to ensure both operational viability and equitable water provision, designing tariffs for socioeconomic, political, and environmental realities must go hand-in-hand with programs that provide water service connections to poor households. In Autonomy Within Sovereignty: The Multi-Scalar Hydropolitics of the Kurdistan Regional Government, Rozita Meihami and co-authors examine the hydropolitical issues faced by the Kurdistan Regional Government within domestic and international contexts. The authors' historical review of the hydropolitics highlights the domestic and international dimensions of transboundary water politics and the power dynamics that underpin both water conflict and cooperation. Effective water management requires a holistic approach that integrates scientific understanding with active stakeholder participation. In Enhancing Participatory Planning for Water Management Through the Use of Innovative Tools in Collaborative Action Research, Chatthip Chaichakan and Dararat Khampeng present community-based water balance management (CBWBM) as a promising strategy to foster collaboration between communities and scientific experts. Drawing on case studies from rural Thailand, the authors report on their investigation into how innovative tools, grounded in futures studies and gamification approaches, can empower communities to actively participate in CBWBM planning processes, highlighting the importance of context-specific design and user-centered development to facilitate deliberative dialogue, knowledge exchange, and informed decision making. Following themes emerging in this issue, Jorge Cardoso-Gonçalves, José Tentúgal-Valente, and Diana Tavares discuss the importance of an integrated vision for water infrastructure management that includes the preservation of good basic practices, safeguarding of people and goods, valorization of water resources, promotion of efficient building solutions, and sustainability of public spaces in their paper Water Services. Circular Integrated Management as a management strategy. The authors present circular integrated management (CIM) as an integrated management strategy for water supply, wastewater, and rainwater drainage, considering the management of solid waste and urban space, as a common model, with the production of energy in water supply and water and wastewater treatment, and the recovery of treatment residues, also part of an integrated approach. Muhajir Mussa Kwikima's article, Enhancing Integrated Water Resources Management in Tanzania Through Participatory and Institutional Capacity Building Approaches, reports on an analysis of opportunities for advancing IWRM in Tanzania through participation and capacity-building interventions. Despite Tanzania's commitment to IWRM, the author identifies important capacity gaps, including hydrological monitoring, enforcement, and financial management, and makes several key recommendations to strengthen fragmented roles, address knowledge gaps, and empower stakeholders. Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water is a principal target of SDG 6. In Bridging Local Initiative and Global Goals: Role of Water Treatment Plant for Localizing Sustainable Development Goal 6, Target 6.1, Prasannata Lamichhane and co-authors present the results of their study on the role of the Dhulikhel Water Treatment Plant in Nepal in localizing SDG 6 at the municipal level. The authors discuss the complex dynamics of water tariffs and upstream-downstream conflicts and make recommendations for granular local-level measures to address potential contamination and improve equity of supply. In Investigating the Transforming Hydrosocial Dynamics in Urbanizing Gurgaon, India, Sheeba Amir and Vishal Narain reflect on the evolving interaction between water and society and the growing water insecurities within the "emerging" urban system of Gurgaon, a city peripheral to New Delhi. The authors discuss the transition of the area from a community-managed traditional water system to a centralized, extractive and techno-centric approach, along with the challenges, and vulnerabilities this has created. Understanding the negative impacts of land use/land cover (LULC) on water quality is key to developing effective integrated catchment management strategies. In Threats Posed by Land Use to Water Quality in South Africa's Strategic Water Source Areas, Kent Anson Locke and Kevin Winter discuss the application and implications of a recently published study on methods for estimating minimum thresholds of natural vegetation necessary for maintaining and protecting water quality in South African catchments. Focusing on the vulnerability of South Africa's strategic water source areas to land-use-related water quality impacts, the authors emphasize the need to restore and preserve sufficient areas of natural land cover to protect these strategic water resources. With the world population projected to grow to nearly 10 billion by 2050, increasing pressure on already scarce freshwater resources, J. Harsha discusses the idea of "saline water footprint" in Unlocking the Blue Frontier:Saline Water Footprint as a Path to Sustainability. Exploring the opportunities and limitations of increasing the use of saline water, the author recommends saline water footprint as an important contribution to integrated water management strategies. In Irrigation Project and Education: A Study on Teesta Barrage Irrigation Project Area of Nilphamari, Bangladesh, Md. Abu Shahen and Md. Nurul Momen present an investigation into how the Teesta Barrage Irrigation Project affects the education of farming families living in the project region. Finding that those in the middle and upper classes have benefited but lower levels have not, the authors make recommendations to address inconsistencies in water available for cultivation throughout the year. Reservoirs play a pivotal role in regulating the hydrological regime, with a range of benefits, but also have positive and negative impacts on the environment and societies. Important, but perhaps not widely recognized, is the impact construction of reservoirs has on soils. Drawing on examples from Ukraine, Maryna Ladyka and Ruofan Wu present their research on the physico-chemical properties of soils in The Impact of Reservoirs on the Soils of Adjacent Areas: Overview of Global and Local Aspects, advocating for the inclusion of these issues in a comprehensive approach to water resource management and environmental protection. Water quality assessment in freshwater ecosystems is crucial for understanding their health and ensuring safe water use for various domestic purposes. In Physicochemical characterization at the drawing and bathing points of Lake Kivu, by the Water Quality Index, Wand'arhasima L. finds that water quality at urban and rural drawing and bathing points is inadequate for sustaining aquatic life and that chemical treatment, disinfection, and rigorous monitoring are necessary for safe use. Concluding that physicochemical parameters are essential but not sufficient as a stand-alone analysis, the author proposes a multiparametric approach, including the World Health Organization cyanophycean standards for aquatic life and the health of beneficiaries/users. In Water Utilization Practices and Wastage at Household Level: A Case Study of Lahore City, Anam Chaudhry and co-authors present their research which found a clear correlation between water shortage and patterns of water utilization and waste. Noting that water shortages could hinder the sustainable development of the Punjab region in Pakistan, including Lahore, the authors propose a range of measures and household water-saving practices to better align water management with the SDG goals. Damte Tegegne Fetene, Tarun Kumar Lohani, and Abdella Kemal Mohammed report on their efforts to model the impact of climate change in Application of Coupled MIKE SHE/MIKE HYDRO on Streamflow Dynamics Under Climate Change in Lake Tana Sub Basin, Abay Basin, Ethiopia. In the case of Laka Tana Sub Basin, the study showed that conditions related to streamflow may change in the future due to climate alteration. The authors argue that by offering a better understanding of current and future climates, the integrated modeling system approach can assist environmentalists, hydrologists, and policymakers in water management and policy intervention. Watershed degradation is a significant global problem, but as a mountainous nation, Nepal faces even greater challenges in managing its water resources. In this context, sub-watershed prioritization is a promising approach for managing watersheds. In Prioritization of Sub-Watershed Using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System in Gandaki Province, Nepal, Diwakar Poudel and co-authors delineated 121 sub-watersheds in the Gandaki Province and quantitatively ranked them to promote targeted action for water resource management, supporting ecosystem preservation, and climate resilience. Inappropriate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in rice farming can be a significant source of pollution in aquatic environments, resulting in declining water quality, impacts on aquatic life and health concerns for riparian communities. In Spatial Variation in Physico-Chemical Water Quality Parameters Associated with Rice Farming in the Dakalt Branch Canal, Kafrelsheikh Governorate, Egypt, Onyango Cersey Ochieng, Ogendi George Morara and Donia Noha Samir conclude from their study that poor rice management practices are responsible for pollution observed from the River Nile. The authors make recommendations for the monitoring of water quality and implementation of Best Management Practices in the application of pesticides and fertilizers. Agriculture plays a crucial role in ensuring food security and reducing poverty in Ethiopia, with rain-fed agriculture predominant. However, rainfall distribution and intensity vary spatially and temporally. Enhancing agricultural water management and irrigation has the potential to increase Ethiopia's agricultural productivity. In Assessment of Surface Irrigation Potential and Crop Water Demand in Daramalo Wereda, Southern Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Melkamu Ateka Derebe and Ligalem Agegn Asres evaluate surface water potential and the irrigation water demand of the Zage River sub-watershed. The findings that suggest the watershed has high surface water potential for surface irrigation for selected crop types are relevant to improving local water management policies and practices, enhancing agricultural productivity, and helping improve the food security of local farmers. In GIS Based Surface Irrigation Potential Assessment of Gololcha River Watershed, Awash Basin, Ethiopia, Wudad Yazid Abagissa and co-authors report on their evaluation of the potential land and water resources for surface irrigation in the watershed. While finding that only 14.15% of the total suitable land can be irrigated using existing flows, the authors note there is potential for expanding surface irrigation, particularly during the rainy seasons. These findings provide valuable insights for developing sustainable irrigation strategies, enhancing agricultural productivity, and contributing to food security in the region. In Hydrological Streamflow Modeling at the Inlet of Gilgel Gibe III Dam of Ethiopia using Soil and Water Assessment Tool, the final article in this issue, Yohannes Mehari Andiye and Tarun Kumar Lohani assessed the accuracy and applicability of the SWAT model in predicting streamflow at the inlet of the Gilgel Gibe III dam watershed. By demonstrating the model's effectiveness in simulating streamflow at the dam's inlet, the now calibrated and validated model can be used to study the effects of climate and land use changes, analyze water quality and sediment yield, and inform future water policy plans, dam construction planning, and flood disaster risk management. We trust you will enjoy reading another rich collection of insights into water policy, practice, and the learning that supports them from around the world. Thank you to all our authors for their fine contributions, to the dozens of reviewers who volunteered their time to support the authors and World Water Policy, and to our hard-working editorial team. The next issue of World Water Policy, to be published in May 2025, will be a special issue on Water Management Under Changing Climate: Innovative Approaches, Solutions, and Policies Towards Resilient Communities, featuring papers presented at Cairo Water Week 2024. Thank you for your ongoing interest in World Water Policy. We look forward to your contributions and other opportunities for collaboration in the future. Our best wishes Susana Neto and Jeff Camkin Editors-in-Chief 《世界水政策》新的一年 Susana Neto1,2* [email protected] and Jeff Camkin1 1Institute of Agriculture, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia 2Civil Engineering Research and Innovation for Sustainability (CERIS), Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal 欢迎阅读2025年《世界水政策杂志》第一期。本期为您带来了来自世界各地的21篇文章, 包括一篇特约社论、16篇研究文章和4篇讨论文。 在世界几乎所有地区, 我们都能看到一系列用于克服"交叉问题的复杂挑战"的努力。水与土地使用、环境保护、城市发展、农业、林业、工业用途、能源生产和其他方面并不独立。水也不是独属于政府的单个领域。正如我们两年前所说的那样, 所有挑战都是相互关联的, 但各国在预测、处理和适应这些变化影响方面的能力并不相同(Camkin and Neto, 2022)。各国也没有相同的资源来尽量减少气候变化、冲突、战争或移民问题的影响。 世界正面临许多不平衡因素, 这些因素也会对水安全产生影响。对水资源的霸权使用导致许多社区遭受不公正的苦难和不平等的生活条件。与水安全相关的基本人权在马德普拉塔联合国水资源大会(1977)上进行了讨论, 随后又在里约联合国环境与发展大会(1992)上进行了讨论, 并于2002年被联合国正式承认为"享有水的权利意味着每个人都有权获得供个人和家庭使用的充足、安全、可接受、易于获取和负担得起的水"(Neto and Camkin, 2024)。 在这个安全威胁日益严重的不稳定世界中, 必须为所有人确保水和卫生设施的可用性和可持续管理, 以实现全球繁荣与和平(UN, 2024)。我们相信, 世界将制定更好的水政策和水治理方法。如果一些地区的经验教训能够被其他地区吸取, 至少我们能继续学习并朝着更可持续的方向发展。 在他们的特约社论《水政策绿化研究需要超越供需导向逻辑, 以期为全民实现水可持续性》中, Franck Poupeau和Brian F. O'Neill反思了2024年第10届水论坛、最新研究和当前趋势, 以揭示供需逻辑如何继续影响由"理性"经济学主导的政策。作者认为, 这并没有导致世界各地所需的社会结构转型, 而是重新强调了土木工程, 例如新建的大型水坝、海水淡化厂和其他"新水"计划的兴起。借鉴美国(亚利桑那州)、法国(巴黎)和玻利维亚(埃尔阿尔托)等采取更谨慎态度的例子, 他们认为有必要重新思考公共行动和民主行动, 以确保通过减少"滥用经济力量"的影响, 以更广泛接受、更公平、破坏性更小的方式分配水资源。作者总结称, 第十届水论坛似乎没有充分关注"通过生态基础设施"实现水政策绿化。 基于特约社论的主题, Sandra Megens和Jeroen Warner在《隐形的线索:米拉-马塔赫跨边界流域多行动者动态中的新兴水治理》一文中讨论了近期兴起的关于"探究新治理制度"的学术兴趣, 这些新治理制度重新定义了地方社区在水管理方面的自治能力, 同时确保遵守中央政府的水法律和监管。采用多中心治理一事强调了去中心化的协作系统对于"有效和可持续地管理水资源"一事的重要性。作者聚焦于哥伦比亚和厄瓜多尔共享的米拉河流域下游地区行动者的相互作用, 采用了一项混合方法, 以全面理解一系列影响跨边界水治理的复杂互动以及社区响应。 Philamer Torio和Leila Harris在《水价与社会公平:面向穷人的水服务连接与定价工具》一文中聚焦于水价在水服务中的重要作用, 它不仅有助于实现运营可持续性和效率目标, 还有助于满足可负担性和公平性要求。作者指出, 即使制定了完善的水价, 贫困家庭仍无法获得管道连接, 因此他们不得不为"难以获得且有时质量可疑的水"支付额外费用, 因此, 作者评估了菲律宾三个市政供水系统的扶贫项目, 并得出结论认为, 为确保运营可行性和公平供水, 设计符合社会-经济、政治和环境现实的水价必须与"为贫困家庭提供水服务连接"的计划齐头并进。 在《主权内的自治:库尔德斯坦地区政府的多尺度水政治》一文中, Rozita Meihami与合著者研究了库尔德斯坦地区政府在国内和国际情境下面临的水政治问题。作者对水政治的历史述评强调了跨边界水政治的国内和国际维度, 以及那些支撑水冲突与合作的权力动态。 有效的水管理需要一种将科学理解与利益攸关方的积极参与相结合的整体方法。在《通过在协同行动研究中使用创新工具来加强水管理的参与式规划》一文中, Chatthip Chaichakan和Dararat Khampeng提出, 以社区为基础的水平衡管理(CBWBM)是一种有前途的战略, 能促进社区与科学专家之间的合作。通过借鉴泰国农村的案例研究, 作者报告了他们的研究结果, 即基于未来研究和游戏化方法的创新工具如何能使社区能够积极参与CBWBM规划过程, 强调了针对具体情况的设计和以用户为中心的开发对"促进协商对话、知识交流和知情决策"一事的重要性。 与本期主题一致的是, Jorge Cardoso-Gonçalves、José Tentúgal-Valente和Diana Tavares在论文《水服务:循环综合管理作为一种管理策略》中讨论了水基础设施管理综合愿景的重要性, 其中包括维护良好的基本实践、保护人员和货物、水资源增值、促进高效的建筑解决方案、以及公共空间的可持续性。作者提出了循环综合管理(CIM)作为供水、废水和雨水排放的综合管理策略, 将固体废物和城市空间的管理视为一种共同模式, 供水和水及废水处理中的能量生产以及处理残留物的回收也是综合方法的一部分。 Muhajir Mussa Kwikima的文章《通过参与式和制度能力建设方法加强坦桑尼亚水资源综合管理》报告了一项分析, 即通过参与和能力建设干预措施来推进坦桑尼亚的水资源综合管理。尽管坦桑尼亚致力于水资源综合管理, 但作者指出了重要的能力差距, 包括水文监测、执法和财务管理, 并提出了几项关键建议, 以加强分散的角色, 解决知识差距并对利益攸关方赋权。 确保全民获得安全且负担得起的饮用水是可持续发展目标6的主要目标。在《连接地方倡议和全球目标:水处理厂在实现可持续发展目标6、具体目标6.1方面的作用》一文中, Prasannata Lamichhane与合著者介绍了他们关于"尼泊尔Dhulikhel水处理厂在市政层面实现可持续发展目标6方面的作用"的研究结果。作者探讨了水价和上下游冲突的复杂动态, 并就详细的当地措施提出了一系列建议, 用于应对潜在污染和改善供应公平性。 在《调查印度古尔冈城市化过程中不断变化的水社会动态》一文中, Sheeba Amir和Vishal Narain反思了水与社会之间不断发展的互动, 以及古尔冈(新德里周边城市之一)这一"新兴"城市系统中日益严重的水不安全问题。作者讨论了该地区从社区管理的传统供水系统向集中式、提取式和技术中心式方法的转变, 以及由此带来的挑战和脆弱性。 理解土地利用/土地覆盖(LULC)对水质的负面影响是制定有效的综合集水区管理战略的关键。在《土地利用对南非战略水源区水质构成的威胁》一文中, Kent Anson Locke和Kevin Winter讨论了最近发表的一项研究的应用和影响, 该研究聚焦于一系列用于估计"维持和保护南非集水区水质所需的自然植被最低阈值"的方法。作者重点关注南非战略水源区对土地利用相关水质影响的脆弱性, 强调需要恢复和保留足够面积的自然土地覆盖以保护这些战略水资源。 预计到2050年, 世界人口将增长至近100亿, 这将给本已稀缺的淡水资源带来更多压力。J Harsha在《解锁蓝色边界:盐水足迹作为可持续性道路》一文中讨论了"盐水足迹"的概念。作者探究了"增加盐水使用"一事的机会和局限性, 建议将盐水足迹作为综合水管理战略的一项重要贡献。 在《灌溉项目与教育:孟加拉国Nilphamari地区Teesta拦水坝灌溉项目区研究》一文中, Md. Abu Shahen和Md. Nurul Momen研究了Teesta拦河坝灌溉项目如何影响项目区农民家庭的教育。作者发现, 中上阶层受益, 但下层阶级没有受益, 因此提出了用于应对"全年耕作用水不一致"问题的建议。 水库在调节水文状况方面发挥着关键作用, 具有一系列益处, 但对环境和社会也有积极和消极的影响。水库建设对土壤的影响很重要, 但可能并未得到广泛认可。Maryna Ladyka和Ruofan Wu借鉴乌克兰的例子, 在《水库对邻近地区土壤的影响:全球和地方概况》一文中介绍了他们对土壤理化性质的研究, 倡导将这些问题纳入水资源管理和环境保护的综合方法中。 淡水生态系统的水质评估对于理解其健康状况和确保各种家庭用途的安全用水至关重要。在《通过水质指数描述基伍湖取水点和沐浴点的理化特性》一文中, Wand'arhasima L发现, 城市和农村取水点和沐浴点的水质不足以维持水生生物, 并且化学处理、消毒和严格监测对于安全用水是必要的。作者认为理化参数是必不可少的, 但作为独立分析还不够, 因此提出了一种多参数方法, 包括世界卫生组织针对水生生物和受益者/用户健康的蓝藻标准。 在《家庭用水实践与浪费:拉合尔市案例研究》一文中, Anam Chaudhry与合著者介绍了他们的研究, 该研究发现, 水资源短缺与水资源利用和浪费模式之间存在明显的相关性。作者指出, 水资源短缺可能会阻碍包括拉合尔在内的巴基斯坦旁遮普地区的可持续发展, 并提出了一系列措施和家庭节水做法, 以使水资源管理更好地与可持续发展目标保持一致。 Damte Tegegne Fetene、Tarun Kumar Lohani和Abdella Kemal Mohammed在《耦合MIKE SHE/MIKE HYDRO 应用于埃塞俄比亚阿拜盆地塔那湖子流域气候变化下的径流动态》一文中报告了他们为模拟气候变化影响所作的努力。在塔那湖子流域的案例中, 研究表明, 由于气候变化, 未来与径流相关的条件可能会发生变化。作者认为, 通过更好地理解当前和未来的气候, 综合建模系统方法能帮助环保主义者、水文学家和政策制定者进行水管理和政策干预。 流域退化是一个重大的全球性问题, 但尼泊尔作为一个山地国家, 在管理其水资源方面面临着更大的挑战。在此情境下, 子流域优先排序是一种有前途的流域管理方法。在《利用遥感和地理信息系统对尼泊尔甘达基省子流域进行优先排序》一文中, Diwakar Poudel与合著者在甘达基省划定了121个子流域, 并对其进行了量化排名, 以促进有针对性的水资源管理行动, 支持生态系统保护和气候适应能力。 水稻种植中化学肥料和农药的不当使用可能是水生环境污染的重要来源, 导致水质下降、水生生物受到影响以及沿岸社区的健康问题。在《埃及卡夫雷尔谢赫省Dakalt支渠水稻种植相关的理化水质参数的空间变化》一文中, Onyango Cersey Ochieng、Ogendi George Morara和Donia Noha Samir从他们的研究中得出结论, 即不良的水稻管理实践是尼罗河污染的原因。作者就水质监测和"农药和化肥施用方面的最佳管理实践"的实施提出了建议。 农业在确保埃塞俄比亚的粮食安全和减贫 方面发挥着至关重要的作用, 雨养农业在埃塞俄比亚占主导地位。然而, 降雨分布和强度在空间和时间上各不相同。加强农业用水管理和灌溉, 有可能提高埃塞俄比亚的农业生产力。在《埃塞俄比亚南部Daramalo Wereda地表灌溉潜力和作物需水量评估》一文中, Melkamu Ateka Derebe和Ligalem Agegn Asres评价了扎格河子流域的地表水潜力和灌溉需水量。研究结果表明, 该流域具有较高的地表水潜力, 可用于某些作物类型的地表灌溉, 这一研究结果对于改善当地水管理政策和实践、提高农业生产力、以及帮助改善当地农民的粮食安全一事至关重要。在《埃塞俄比亚阿瓦什盆地戈洛尔恰河流域基于GIS的地表灌溉潜力评估》一文中, Wudad Yazid Abagissa与合著者报告了他们对用于流域地表灌溉的潜在土地和水资源的评估。虽然作者发现, 只有14.15%的土地可通过现有水流加以灌溉, 但作者指出, 扩大地面灌溉一事具有潜力, 特别是在雨季。这些发现为制定可持续灌溉战略、提高农业生产力、以及促进该地区的粮食安全提供了宝贵的见解。在本期最后一篇文章《使用土壤和水评估工具对埃塞俄比亚Gilgel Gibe III大坝入口的水文径流进行建模》中, Yohannes Mehari Andiye和Tarun Kumar Lohani评估了SWAT模型在预测Gilgel Gibe III大坝流域入口径流方面的准确性和适用性。通过展示该模型在模拟大坝入口径流方面的有效性, 现已校准和验证的模型可用于研究气候和土地利用变化的影响, 分析水质和泥沙产量, 并为"未来的水政策计划、大坝建设规划和洪灾风险管理"提供信息。 我们相信您将享受阅读本期关于水政策、实践以及"世界各地用于支持这些政策与实践的学习"的丰富见解。感谢所有作者的出色稿件, 感谢数十位自愿抽出时间支持作者和《世界水政策》的审稿人, 以及我们辛勤工作的编辑团队。 《世界水政策》下一期将于2025年5月出版, 它将是一期特刊, 主题为"气候变化下的水管理:面向复原力社区的创新方法、解决方案与政策", 聚焦于2024年"开罗水周"上发表的论文。 感谢您对《世界水政策》的持续关注。我们期待您的投稿和其他合作机会。 献上最美好的祝愿 Susana Neto 和 Jeff Camkin 主编 关键词:水治理, 水政策, 可持续发展目标6, 水资源综合管理, 循环性与水服务, 水与粮食安全 参考文献 Camkin, J. and Neto, S. 2022.

En este número, les traemos otras 21 contribuciones de todo el mundo, incluido un editorial invitado, 16 artículos de investigación y 4 documentos de debate. En prácticamente todas las regiones del mundo podemos observar esfuerzos por superar desafíos complejos derivados de cuestiones interseccionales. El agua no es independiente del uso de la tierra, la protección del medio ambiente, el desarrollo urbano, la agricultura, la silvicultura, los usos industriales, la producción de energía y otras dimensiones. El agua tampoco es un área única y compartimentada de gobierno. Como ya dijimos hace un par de años, todos los desafíos están interconectados, pero nuestra capacidad para predecir, abordar y adaptarnos al impacto de esos cambios no es igual en todos los países (Camkin y Neto, 2022). Tampoco lo son los recursos para minimizar los impactos del cambio climático, los conflictos y las guerras, o las cuestiones migratorias. El mundo se enfrenta a numerosos factores desequilibrantes que también tienen consecuencias para la seguridad hídrica. Los usos hegemónicos de los recursos hídricos provocan sufrimiento injusto y condiciones de vida desiguales en muchas comunidades. En relación con la seguridad hídrica, los derechos humanos básicos al agua se debatieron en la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Agua en Mar del Plata (1977), siguieron en la Conferencia de las Naciones Unidas sobre el Medio Ambiente y el Desarrollo en Río (1992) y fueron reconocidos formalmente por las Naciones Unidas en 2002 como "el derecho al agua como el derecho de toda persona a agua suficiente, salubre, aceptable, físicamente accesible y asequible para uso personal y doméstico" (Neto y Camkin, 2024). En este mundo inestable donde las amenazas a la seguridad son cada vez más graves, es necesario garantizar la disponibilidad y la gestión sostenible del agua y el saneamiento para todos, en aras de la prosperidad y la paz mundiales (ONU, 2024). Confiamos en que el mundo seguirá este camino para desarrollar mejores enfoques en materia de políticas y gobernanza del agua. Si las lecciones de algunas regiones pueden ser escuchadas por otras, al menos podremos seguir aprendiendo y evolucionando hacia una mayor sostenibilidad. En su editorial invitada, La investigación sobre la ecologización de las políticas hídricas debe ir más allá de las lógicas orientadas a la oferta y la demanda para lograr la sostenibilidad del agua, Franck Poupeau y Brian F. O'Neill reflexionan sobre el 10º Foro del Agua en 2024, las investigaciones recientes y las tendencias actuales para desentrañar cómo las lógicas de oferta y demanda siguen informando las políticas dominadas por la economía "racional". Los autores sostienen que esto no ha llevado a las transformaciones estructurales sociales necesarias en todo el mundo, sino más bien a un nuevo énfasis en la ingeniería civil ejemplificado por el surgimiento de nuevas megapresas, plantas de desalinización y otras iniciativas de "nueva agua". Extrayendo lecciones de ejemplos como los de Estados Unidos (Arizona), Francia (París) y Bolivia (El Alto), donde se adoptó un enfoque más precautorio, consideran que es necesario repensar la acción pública y democrática para garantizar que el agua se distribuya de una manera más ampliamente aceptable, equitativa y menos destructiva, reduciendo la influencia de fuerzas económicas abusivas. Los autores concluyen que el X Foro del Agua no parece haber prestado suficiente atención a la ecologización de la política hídrica a través de la infraestructura ecológica. Basándose en un tema de nuestro editorial invitado, Sandra Megens y Jeroen Warner discuten el reciente aumento del interés académico en explorar el surgimiento de nuevos regímenes de gobernanza que redefinen las capacidades de autogobierno de las comunidades locales en la gestión del agua, al tiempo que garantizan el cumplimiento de las leyes y regulaciones del agua del gobierno central en Hilos invisibles: gobernanza emergente del agua en la dinámica multiactor de la cuenca transfronteriza del río Mira-Mataje. La adopción de una gobernanza policéntrica enfatiza la importancia de los sistemas descentralizados y colaborativos para gestionar de manera eficaz y sostenible los recursos hídricos. Centrándose en las interacciones de los actores en torno al área de aguas abajo de la cuenca del río Mira, que comparten Colombia y Ecuador, los autores emplearon un enfoque de métodos mixtos para obtener conocimientos integrales sobre las interacciones complejas que dan forma a la gobernanza del agua transfronteriza y las respuestas de la comunidad. Philamer Torio y Leila Harris se centran en el importante papel de las tarifas de los servicios de agua, no sólo para alcanzar objetivos de sostenibilidad y eficiencia operativa, sino también para abordar los requisitos de asequibilidad y equidad en Tarifas de agua y equidad social: hacia conexiones de servicios de agua e instrumentos de fijación de precios para los pobres. Observando que incluso con una tarifa de agua bien diseñada, la incapacidad de los hogares pobres para obtener conexiones por tuberías da lugar al pago de primas por agua a la que es difícil acceder y, a veces, de calidad cuestionable, los autores evalúan proyectos en favor de los pobres de tres sistemas de agua municipales en Filipinas, y concluyen que, para garantizar tanto la viabilidad operativa como el suministro equitativo de agua, el diseño de tarifas para las realidades socioeconómicas, políticas y ambientales debe ir de la mano con programas que proporcionen conexiones de servicios de agua a los hogares pobres.

N2  - Malaria poses a significant public health threat globally, across Africa and in Ethiopia. The use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is currently a proven prevention mechanism. Evidence is building on what happens to LLINs following mass distribution campaigns, with mixed results from different studies, some reporting very low use for intended purposes, others an encouraging level of using for intended purposes. In Ethiopia, between 2005 and 2015, about 64 million LLINs were distributed through periodic mass campaigns with the aims to achieve 100% coverage and 80% utilization. However, studies from rural Ethiopia showed variable LLINs coverage and utilization rate. The MalTrial Project, a collaborative venture between Hawassa University, Ethiopia and NROAID, Norway, has started a trial project in 2014 in Adami Tullu District of central Ethiopia. Quantitative surveys have established evidence on LLINs ownership and utilization, but the behavioural, sociocultural and socioeconomic dynamics of why LLINs' use for intended purposes is low or why they are employed for other purposes remained elusive. The present qualitative study, building on the quantitative findings and framework, therefore, attempted to fill gaps in these areas using qualitative methods in selected localities of the district.The study employed 7 focus groups, 16 individual interviews and observation to undertake data collection in January 2017. The data were analysed using NVivo Version 11 (QSR International) to transcribe, code and identify themes using thematic analysis approach.The study found out that certain households were more likely to use nets for intended needs in proper ways; a range of factors, notably socio-cultural and poverty, highly influence users' ideas about the right ways and decisions to use and care for the nets; knowledge gaps and wrong perception exist regarding the purposes and life cycle of the nets; LLINs are employed for repurposed uses once they are considered non-viable, old, or lose their physical integrity; existence of misuse was acknowledged and understood as wrong; and values about gender roles further shape uses, misuses and repurposed use of the nets.Behavioural, socio-cultural, economic and ecological conditions coupled with deficiencies in perceived bed net design and distribution policies; weak education, communication and social support structures were important in understanding and accounting for why a low level of intended use and a rampant misuse and repurposed use in Adami Tullu community of Ethiopia. A major nexus to address in order to improve intended use of LLINs lies, first and foremost, in economic poverty and socio-cultural factors that underlie much of the misuse and repurposed use of the nets.

N2  - Abstract Background: Leishmaniasis is the top health problem among migrant workers in Ethiopia. Poor disease risk perception and inappropriate health-seeking behaviour are significant challenges to prevent and eliminate the disease. Therefore, there is a lack of guidance on supporting migrant workers in taking actions to prevent Leishmaniasis. Method: Between June and November 2019, we conducted qualitative research among migrant workers at risk of Leishmaniasis in Ethiopia. Seventeen Focus Group Discussions and 16 Key informant interviews were conducted to study risk perception in relation to exposure to sandfly bites and the use of sandfly control measures amongst migrant workers. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated for analysis. Data were analyzed by qualitative content analysis using ATLASti. Result: Migrant workers feel susceptible to Leishmaniasis due to their past exposure, and the disease is prevalent in the area. However, they feel that Leishmaniasis is a mild illness that is easy to cure. While there is a general acceptance of Insecticide Treated Net (ITN) as a protective measure, hesitations remain in the actual behaviour of utilizing it due to the alternative use of the traditional practice, seasonality, and the inconvenience to hang in the farmland areas. The central cues were the message reminders from health workers and rose in sandfly bite irritation regardless of the high perceived self-efficacy. Based on the findings, three-level intervention modalities are recommended: 1) awareness creation throughout of door media (posters, stickers, billboards) at pre-arrival, 2) the arrival level aims to stimulate the use of protective measures to be initiated and maintained, and 3) the aim at the departure level is to inform about the recognition of late signs and symptoms and the use of the protective measure to be continued at home. Conclusion: This finding proposes that leishmaniasis prevention interventions should focus on individuals' perceptions to promote consistent use of protective measures. Results empowered the researchers to foster comprehension of the content required for effective intervention.

N2  - <title>Abstract</title> Maize is one of the most widely grown crops in Ethiopia, although common rust maize disease (CRMD) is becoming a serious problem. Conventional CRMD detection and treatment methods are time-consuming, expensive and ineffective. To solve these problems, we propose a real-time deep learning model that provides disease detection and pesticide dosing recommendations. In the model development process, we collect 8000 maize-leaf images experimentally with permission obtained from Haramaya University and apply image pre-processing such as image equalization, augmentation, noise removal, and image enhancement to improve the performance of the proposed model. We then jointly apply batch normalization, dropout, and early stopping during training the proposed algorithm to reduce the overfitting problem. Next, we generate an optimal model that recognizes CRMD and classifies it accurately based on its severity levels. To evaluate the proposed techniques, we compare Resnet50 with other state-of-the-art algorithms, such as VGG19, VGG16, and AlexNet algorithms with similar parameters. The performance of ResNet50 is more than 2% better than that of other algorithms in terms of accuracy. The proposed technique provides promising results for the classification of CRMD and pesticide dosage recommendations based on the severity of the disease type. This study also demonstrates the potential of Resnet50 models for improving maize disease management.

N2  - Environmental impacts and long-term morphological changes on the natural water course and mainly through soil erosion (water erosion) due to human intervention, the reservoirs handled by sedimentation. Soil erosion and sedimentation are natural phenomena involved in landscape formation. Cumulative sediment yield is influenced by the combination of factors including soil erodability, soil textural class, organic matter content, watershed area, topography and vegetation cover. In Ethiopia, accelerated sedimentation in reservoirs providing hydroelectric power and irrigation water has resulted in loss of these intended services. The frequent power-cuts and rationing-based electric power distribution recently experienced in the country are also partially attributed to the loss of storage capacity of hydroelectric power reservoirs. Sediment derived from soil erosion and delivered to rivers is a major source of various environmental problems such as sediment deposition in river channels and reservoirs which deteriorates water quality. Sedimentation is a critical pollutant in surface waters that adversely affect water quality and contains other important contaminants including nutrients, pesticides and heavy metals. Some minerals transported with sediments like Cu, Pb, As and Hg are extremely toxic even in small concentration and affect quality of water in dams for various purposes. The suspended solids in the eroded material increases the raw water turbidity (i.e., water becomes muddy and physically dirty),which increases water treatment costs.

N2  - Abstract The development of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors is of increasing concern in Ethiopia because of its potential implications for vector control failure. To better elucidate the specificity of resistance mechanisms and to facilitate the design of control strategies that minimize the likelihood of selecting for cross-resistance, a whole transcriptomic approach was used to explore gene expression patterns in a multi-insecticide resistant population of Anopheles arabiensis from Oromia Region, Ethiopia. This field population was resistant to the diagnostic doses of malathion (average mortality of 71.9%) and permethrin (77.4%), with pools of survivors and unexposed individuals analyzed using Illumina RNA-sequencing, alongside insecticide susceptible reference strains. This population also demonstrated deltamethrin resistance but complete susceptibility to alpha-cypermethrin, bendiocarb and propoxur, providing a phenotypic basis for detecting insecticide-specific resistance mechanisms. Transcriptomic data revealed overexpression of genes including cytochrome P450s, glutathione-s-transferases and carboxylesterases (including CYP4C36, CYP6AA1, CYP6M2, CYP6M3, CYP6P4, CYP9K1, CYP9L1, GSTD3, GSTE2, GSTE3, GSTE4, GSTE5, GSTE7 and two carboxylesterases) that were shared between malathion and permethrin survivors. We also identified nineteen highly overexpressed cuticular-associated proteins (including CYP4G16, CYP4G17 and chitinase) and eighteen salivary gland proteins (including D7r4 short form salivary protein), which may be contributing to a non-specific resistance phenotype by either enhancing the cuticular barrier or promoting binding and sequestration of insecticides, respectively. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular basis of insecticide resistance in this lesser well-characterized major malaria vector species. Importance Insecticide-resistant mosquito populations remain a significant challenge to global malaria vector control. While substantial progress has been made unraveling resistance mechanisms in major vector species, such as Anopheles gambiae and An. funestus , comparatively less is known about An. arabiensis populations. Using a whole transcriptomic approach, we investigated genes associated with resistance to insecticides used to control An. arabiensis in Ethiopia. Study findings revealed shared detoxification genes between organophosphate- and pyrethroid-resistant vectors and highly overexpressed cuticular-associated proteins and salivary gland proteins, which may play a role in enhancing insecticide resistance. The whole transcriptomic analysis detected novel resistance-associated genes, which warrant functional validation to determine their specificity to particular insecticides and their potential to confer cross-resistance between different insecticides with the same mode of action. These genes may contribute to the development of diagnostic markers to monitor insecticide resistance dynamics in the field.

N2  - Background Mobile or seasonal migrant workers are at increased risk for acquiring malaria infections and can be the primary source of malaria reintroduction into receptive areas. The aim of this formative assessment was to describe access to malaria prevention and control interventions among seasonal migrant or mobile workers in seven regional states of Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional formative assessment was conducted using a qualitative and quantitative mixed-method design, between October 2015 and October 2016. Quantitative data were collected from organizations that employ seasonal migrant workers and were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and ArcGIS 10.8 (Geo-spatial data). Qualitative data were collected using in-depth interview from 23 key informants (7 seasonal migrant workers, and 16 experts and managers of development projects who had hired seasonal migrant workers), which were recorded, transcribed, translated, coded, and thematically analyzed. Results There were 1,017,888 seasonal migrant workers employed in different developmental organizations including large-scale crop cultivating farms, sugar cane plantations, horticulture, road and house construction work, and gold mining and panning. Seasonal migrant workers’ housing facilities were poorly structured and overcrowded (30 people living per 64 square meter room) limiting the use of indoor residual spraying (IRS), and forcing seasonal migrant workers not to use long lasting insecticidal treated nets (LLINs). Seasonal migrant workers are engaged in nighttime activities when employment includes watering farmlands, harvesting sesame, and transporting sugar cane from the field to factories. Despite such high-risk living conditions, access and utilization of preventive and curative services by the seasonal workers were limited. Informal migrant worker employment systems by development organizations and inadequate technical and financial support coupled with poor supply chain management limited the planning and delivery of malaria prevention and treatment strategies targeting seasonal migrant workers. Conclusions Seasonal migrant workers in seven regions of Ethiopia were at substantial risk of acquiring malaria. Existing malaria prevention, control and management interventions were inadequate. This will contribute to the resurgence of outbreaks of malaria in areas where transmission has been lowered. A coordinated action is needed among all stakeholders to identify the size of seasonal migrant workers and develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to address their healthcare needs.

In the coming years it will be essential to increase food productivity and production in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and with smallholders. This however requires finding viable solutions to a number of complex technical, institutional and policy issues including land markets, research on seeds and inputs; agricultural extension; credit; rural infrastructure; storage; connection to markets; rural nonfarm employment and food price stabilization. This paper reviews what the economic literature has to say on these topics. It discusses in turn the role played by agriculture in the development process and the interactions between agriculture and other economic sectors; the determinants of the Green Revolution and discuss the foundations of agricultural growth; issues of income diversification by farmers; approaches to rural development; and finally issues of international trade policy and food security which are at the root of the crisis in agricultural commodity volatility in the past few years.

N2  - This report represents the initial effort to structure existing knowledge about agroecology as farming and food system in support of the EC Knowledge Centre on Food and Nutrition Security (https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/global-food-nutrition-security_en). Scientific literature has been screened on a selection of developing countries in which food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture represent a focal sector for EU intervention (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cuba, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Kenya, Lao PDR, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania, Togo, Zimbabwe). In total, 172 documents have been synthesised, a country brief has been prepared for each investigated country, and some general conclusions have been drawn. Overall, the majority of analysed publications focuses on small scale, extensive farming systems that produce food at subsistence levels and for sale on local markets. This includes smallholder farming producing staple crops (millet, sorghum, yam, etc.) or vegetable gardening for local markets. The agroecological practices that are mostly studied are: agroforestry, intercropping (or mixed cropping), introduction of legumes in rotations, soil and water conservation practices (mulching, return of crop residues, zai holes etc.), use of animal manure, biocontrol methods to mitigate chemical pesticide use. At least 50% of the analysed papers report a positive contribution of agroecological practices to food security, mostly due to improved yields and/or a better economic situation of producers. The improvement of soil quality is key to improve yields and consequently income and food security; this can be achieved using various practices including the use of residue mulch from tree leaves in agroforestry, as well as crop mixtures or intercropping and longer more diversified crop rotations. Moreover, higher on-farm crop species diversity often results in more diversified diets. Diversified crop systems, including the introduction of agroforestry, improve household nutritional status and have positive links to better health conditions. On the other hand, the lack of access to inputs is an important limitation to the improvement of soil fertility (manure, mineral fertilizer, leaf litter, etc.), which remains a major hindrance for food security. The agroecological cultivation of cash crops, post-harvest practices and crop-livestock integration were overall lacking in the scientific analyses, as well as the assessments of fully agroecological systems compared to individual agroecological practices or groups of practices. Increasing financial support from the government, of scientific knowledge on practices alternative to what currently applied, higher market value for agroecological products have been identified as important factors to be improved for the development of agroecology at the farm level.

N2  - Agronomic management status in cauliflower cultural practices in Ethiopia for vegetable crop production technology Yalew Teshome, Alemneh loyew Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR), Ministry of Agriculture, Bahirdar, Ethiopia Abstract Cauliflower in Ethiopia is one of the several vegetables in the species Brassica oleracea in the family Brassicacea it is annual plant the reproduces by seed. Typically only the head (the white curd) is eaten. Cauliflower is low in flat low in carbohydrates but high in dietary fiber, water and vitamin c, posing a high nutritional density with vegetable production for cauliflower Cauliflower is one of the most important cool season vegetables crops grown throughout the country and relished by the most of the people. Being a heavy feeder. Many applied research stations to conserve the richness of the gene pool and develop us formed on the production side Cauliflower demands constant supply of large amount of nutrients and water for its luxury. Yield of 50t/ha of cauliflower removes apparently 200kg Nitrogen 85 kg phosphorus and 279 kg potassium it is productivity depends up on the balanced fertilizer and is not adequately fertilize red considerable yield losses are apparent. In the context of Nepal cauliflower is grown as both seasonal and off seasonal vegetable. It is grown during cool summer months in highly elevations and can be successfully grown in winter in the tropical regions it is cultivated 34,065 ha of land with annual of 524,205 mt (MOAD 2013). Seedling should be grown in a well aerated medium which has a good water holding capacity. Heads of high quality are white to cream in color form and impact and packing normally the produce is sent the market loose or sometimes it is packed in gunny bags. Keywords: cauliflower, cultivation, fertilizers, production Introduction Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var Botrytis) is part of a large group of plants known as Cole Crops. Cole crops are a group (family) in the Brassicaceae or mustard family (previously Cruciferae or crucifers). It is an annual plant that reproduces by seed. Typically, only the head (the white curd) is eaten. The cauliflower head is composed of a white inflorescence meristem. Cauliflower heads resemble those in broccoli, which differs in having flower buds. Chien Yi Wang. 2003 [2]. Cole crops originated from the word caulis, meaning stem or stalk of a plant. Cole crops are biennials, but are generally grown as annuals. Cauliflower came from the Mediterranean region. The first description of cauliflower appeared in 1544. Cauliflower is one of the cultivated varietals of cabbage. It is picked during the bud stage before it blossoms. The flowers are the parts that are most frequently eaten because they are the most nutritious It is commonly believed that cauliflower originated in the Middle East, and in Italy, since the 15th century. Cauliflower may have migrated to Europe from Cyprus, and during the 16th century, it spread in popularity from Italy to France. New York, Orange Judd Company, (1918) [1]. The brassica family is quite cold resistant, making them well adapted to cool season production. With most Cole Crops, a cold period is necessary for flowering, however each crop has its own temperature tolerances. Young, hardened cauliflower plants can withstand temperatures of 0C for less than 36 hours. The minimum and maximum growing temperatures for cauliflower are 0 and 300C, with the optimum growing temperature for this crop between 15 and 20C. The minimum, optimum and maximum germination temperatures for cauliflower are 7, 27 and 29 0C respectfully. World Production At present, cauliflower is grown in more than 90 countries and its production is more than 20.9 million metric tons. In terms of production, People's Republic of China ranks first followed by India, Spain, Mexico, Italy, France, United States, Poland, Pakistan, Egypt and United Arab Republic, amongst others. Once India stood first, however, at present India is in the second position in its Production. As far as the share in the world production is concerned, China has 43.26 per cent, India 32.31 per cent and that of Spain is 2.53 per cent. As a whole, more than 75 per cent of the world production is from Asian region itself. Nutritive value and health benefits Cauliflower is rich in vitamins A and C. Cooked cauliflower contains a good amount of vitamin B and a fair amount of protein in comparison to other vegetables.

Objective To review production technology on cauliflower crop. Methdology Review literature from Internet, Books and journals, unpublished document. Climate and soil requirement Cauliflower is a cool-season crop, and produces the best quality heads at temperatures between 15oC and 20oC. Depending on the stage of growth, the cauliflower plant requires 1 to 2 inches of moisture per week. Excessive moisture during the first 2-3 weeks after transplanting (4-5 weeks after direct-seeding) increases the incidence of root diseases and may cause cauliflower to "button" (form heads prematurely). Prematurely-formed heads are generally too small to market. They are also usually yellow, because the plant's leaves have typically not yet developed adequately to protect the curd from direct sunlight (see "Tying" section). If cauliflower roots are under water for over 24 hours, plants generally die. Cauliflower is the most sensitive of the cole crops to adverse weather. Mature cauliflower plants can withstand temperatures as low as 25o F for several hours late in the fall without damage to the curd. However, young plants subject to freezing temperatures often "button," or suffer from "blindness"--that is, they do not develop a head. Warm temperatures can also promote disorders. Cauliflower heads maturing at temperatures above 85o F (29oC) may suffer from leafy head, richness (over-mature florets), discoloration (generally purple or green in color), soft and loose heads, or poor "wrapper leaf" development. Good development of wrapper leaves is needed to assure that the curd maintains its white color. And also High temperatures during cauliflower production delay maturity and increase vegetative growth and cool temperatures hasten maturity and may induce 'bolting'. Bolting is the premature formation of seed stalks. Fluctuating temperatures may induce some cauliflower cultivars which have begun heading, to revert back to vegetative phase which results in poor quality curds. Crop varieties The cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) plant belongs to the family Cruciferae. Its varieties are very responsive to temperature and photoperiod. It is therefore, very important to sow the appropriate variety at right time. Early varieties if sown late produce "button" head and late varieties if sown early will go on giving leafy growth and will produce curds very late. Early-season cultivars mature approximately 50 to 55 days after transplanting. Cultural Practices Seedling Production Seedlings should be grown in a well-aerated medium, which has good water holding capacity and at a pH of around 6.5. Generally, peat, bark and vermiculite mixes are used. Media problems typically include excessive tannins and low air filled porosity, which results in poor drainage and the buildup of green mound. The medium should be pre-enriched and the seedlings should be fertilized. For optimum germination, the seedling trays should be placed in a germination chamber, at 20 °C with high relative humidity. The seedlings should be moved to the tunnel at the first sign of germination. The ideal temperature for seedling cultivation is 20 °C. Seedling management is a critical factor in cauliflower production, as the following factors related to seedling production may result in physiological disorders: Seedbeds A more normal method is to sow in well-prepared seedbeds and to transplant the seedlings when they are sufficiently developed. The soil and fertility requirements for seedbeds are the same as those for the land. Soils which cap should be avoided. Seedbeds should not be made on any site where crucifers have been grown within the past three years. Sites for seedbeds should not be exposed to very strong winds, but there should be good air movement to reduce disease incidence. Avoid sites too close to rivers or streams, or where dew is heavy, for the same reason. However, easy access to irrigation water is essential. The site should be fully exposed to the sun, and not too close to competitive tree roots. Seedbeds should have a firm, level surface; low spots become too wet at times and high spots are often too dry. Beds should be no more than 1 m in width and of any convenient length, with narrow access paths between them. They are often raised a few centimeters above the normal soil surface to reduce the chance of water-logging should heavy rains occur. Use a minimum of 300 square meters of bed for every 500 g of seed sown. Denser plantings will tend to produce unsuitably long, thin, lanky seedlings, which do not perform well. Seed is sown thinly to a depth of not more than 15 mm, in rows drawn 150 to 200 mm apart. Although seed size (usually 200 to 300 seeds/g) and germination do vary, a rule of thumb is to plant about 60 to 70 g of seed for every 10 000 transplants required, where seedbed conditions are good. Many growers plant about 10% more seed than they require, to ensure that sufficient seedlings are available to fill the entire land. Frequent light irrigations are necessary to prevent drying out of the top soil in which the seed is planted. Gradually increase the interval between irrigations to about 7 days when the plants are Well-established. Drenching the soil just after emergence with Previcur N or Pro plant can reduce the incidence of "damping-off", caused by various soil fungi. Spray the young seedlings (weekly) with a suitable fungicide as a routine spray or at the first signs of Downy Mildew. The danger of outbreak of seedling diseases rises considerably under conditions of overcrowding, inadequate ventilation and poor drainage from the seedbed. Spray with sodium or ammonium molybdate when the seedlings are 3 to 4 weeks old where molybdenum deficiencies are known to occur, and follow this a week later with a slobber spray where the soil is deficient in boron. Keep the seedlings moist and growing strongly for 3 to 6 weeks or until they are 7 to 10 cm tall. Then reduce watering over the last 7 to 10 days (but do not allow the plants to wilt severely) in order to harden them to withstand the shock of transplanting. Give the seedbeds a good soaking the day before transplanting in order to restore a good water regime in the seedlings, and to facilitate lifting of the plants with minimal root damage. Short, sturdy, slightly hardened seedlings about 10 to 15 cm tall, and with 4 to 5 true leaves, transplant and perform better than soft lanky, etiolated plants. The latter develop as a result of sowing too densely (seedbed area is too small), over-use of nitrogen fertilizers and over-watering. Under warm conditions, cauliflower seedlings may reach the required size within 4 to 5 weeks, but under cooler conditions may take 7 or 8 weeks, even with good seedbed practice. Young plants of the required size yield better than older ones. Only those plants which have reached the desired size are used for transplanting. Those developing more slowly may be transplanted slightly later when they are more developed, but are ultimately less likely to perform as well. Seed Trays As an alternative to open seedbeds, most commercial and many small-scale growers are produce their plants in Styrofoam or similar trays (the so-called seedling system), or purchase plants from specialized nurseries who use this system. Whilst this system has certain advantages, particularly for those growers who cannot produce seedlings well in open seedbeds, there are also some disadvantages. Even comparatively poor or off-type plants (so-called sibs) are often usable from such seedlings, but would probably not be used from seedbeds, and the high cost of transplants may cause some growers to revert to open seedbeds, particularly for open-pollinated varieties or those with less expensive hybrid cultivars. However, there is a saving in seed cost, and seedlings transplant more successfully, and with most growers perform better, with a more uniform, concentrated maturity, than do seedlings raised in seedbeds. Spacing A general spacing of between 28 000 and 35 000 plants per hectare is recommended. Spacing and plant population affect head size, head shape and yield. Should the specific market demand be for large heads, then wider spacing and lower population will be adopted for any specific variety than where the market prefers smaller heads. Generally speaking it is found that most growers tend to under-plant, i.e. have lower than optimum population. Cauliflowers: Large-Framed Varieties: 75cm to 90cm x 500 mm to 600 mm (about 22 000 Plants per hectare). Small-Framed Varieties: 600 mm to 750 mm x 400 mm to 450 mm (about 35 000 plants per hectare). Fertilization The soil is a resource that needs to be managed and monitored meticulously. It is essential that the soil samples of the intended growing area are analyzed by an accredited laboratory to determine the nutrient status of the soil. Based on soil analysis results a fertilization program can then be developed. This program is obviously specific for the type of soil that was sampled and subsequently analyzed. This exercise should be done every season or every time a new crop is planted on the land. In addition to having soil samples tested, the water quality should be analyzed because water quality can have a direct effect on the growth of the plant. For example, irrigation water with high calcium levels can increase the soil pH. Being a heavy feeder, cauliflowers require fertile soils. Soils must be fertilized according to soil analysis results. General recommendations: N-200-240kg/ha. 60-80 kg/ha at pre-plant. Top dress balance at 7, 14, 21 & 28 days after transplant, P - 50-60kg/ha, K - 250kg/ha Irrigation The availability of water can be critical to successful production. In the case of direct seeding, plan to irrigate every three days until the seedlings are established. Steady, even growth of cauliflower plants is necessary for high quality and yields. Irrigation may also be used to cool plants during periods of high temperature. Fertilizer could be applied through an irrigation system. Cauliflower requires a regular water supply of 25 mm every 5 to 7 days. Total water requirement is approximately 440mm. The most critical moisture period is during head development. Irrigation at the wrong time can cause problems such as head rot of cauliflower. Sprinkler, furrow and drip irrigation are used in cauliflower production. They are cool-season, moisture-loving plants, which should never be exposed to drought-stress. Until the plants are well-established after transplanting, they should be kept continually moist, with no more than 25% of the available water being used before re-watering. Up to about the halfway growth stage no more than 40% depletion of available water should be allowed. Thereafter the soil may be allowed to dry a little more, but irrigation should nevertheless take place as soon as 50% of available water is depleted. Cauliflower, especially, should not be allowed to wilt once curds have formed as, apart from reducing yield, the curds may become exposed to the sun and discolor as a result. (Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, 2012) [4]. Crop Rotation A general guideline to follow concerning crop rotation is that a crop should never follow itself. Continuous cropping of any crop will result in an increase of disease and insect pressure and possibly a reduction in yields. A proper rotation will include growing different botanical families on the same piece of land, in sequential seasons. The table below outlines some of the common botanical families vegetables belong to. By rotating crops that leave a high volume of residue in the soil, soil fertility can be enhanced naturally. Crop rotation can also improve soil structure by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Crop rotation plays a key role in an IPM programme by aiding in the suppression of diseases, insects and weeds. Crops within the same plant family tend to be susceptible to the same pests, therefore rotation of non-susceptible crops for several years allows all plant material to decompose and pest cycles to become disrupted. Without the presence of susceptible plant material, the number of disease and insect organisms will begin to diminish. Crop rotation aids in weed control because the growth habit of each crop differs, which causes a decrease in a weed's' ability to compete for space. Tillage practices and timings are different for each crop group, resulting in a decrease in a weed's ability to establish permanently. Because of disease and insect pressures it is best not to plant cauliflower more often than once every four years. Brassica crops use a lot of nitrogen so it may be beneficial to plant a legume crop before cauliflower. Cauliflower has an intermediate root depth that will aid in improving soil structure and aeration. This crop has small seeds which will require a finely manicured seedbed; therefore previous crop residue will not be tolerated. If transplants are used, the roots can tolerate some plant residue, but too much will negatively affect root growth. Tying Cauliflower for processing is not normally tied. When this is done to keep heads white, leaves are usually gathered around the head at about the time that they are 2 cm in diameter. Leaves are held together with rubber bands or string. When several tyings are needed, use different colored rubber bands. This facilitates harvesting by allowing all plants with the same color band to be harvested at the same time. Thinning After the first true leaves have formed, the plants must be thinned so as to leave 1 plant at each location (about 3 weeks after seeding). Avoid delay in thinning as thinning large plants results in too much disruption of the remaining plants, contributing to an uneven harvest. Packaging Normally the produce is sent to the market loose or sometimes it is packed in gunny bags. However, it is advisable to pack it in bamboo or wooden baskets to reduce damage in transit. When packing is done in gunny bags, the inner leaves covering the curd surface are left intact and rest of outer leaves is removed. When curds are transported loose, most of the leaves with top portion are retained and a few outer whorls along with damaged leaves are cut off. Storage and Conditioning Cauliflower keeps for 2 to 6 weeks at 0 0C and 95% relative humidity. Heads should be cooled to 5 0C or below soon after harvest. Both hydro cooling and vacuum cooling are effective methods to remove field heat. In addition, forced-air cooling can be used. Never use ice on cauliflower. Cauliflower that is destined for storage is preferable cut slightly immature, otherwise the curds may separate. Controlled atmospheres do not extend the storage life of cauliflower and may cause off-odors, softening or discoloration. Wilting, browning, yellowing of leaves and decay are likely to increase if stored above 5 OC. Slightly immature and compact heads keep better than more mature ones. Cauliflower is very sensitive to temperature fluctuations during storage and such fluctuation causes darkening of curds. Exposure to ethylene during storage will cause more rapid leaf yellowing and abscission. Controlled atmosphere (CA) is not recommended because it induces off odors and flavors, which can be detected only in the cooked products. Dr. Viliam Zvalo, &Alana Respondek, (2007) [5].

N2  - Background: Aloe species are among the most significant plants with several applications. Many of the species, however, are underexplored, owing to their scarcity and limited geographical distribution. A. adigratana Reynolds, which is common in Ethiopia, is one of the little-studied and endangered Aloe species. Objective: This preliminary study focuses on the phytochemical screening, proximate analysis, essential oil content, and antifungal activities of A. adigratana leaf peels. Antifungal activities were also tested on the gels of the plant for comparison. Methods: Standard procedures were used for phytochemical and proximate composition studies. Essential oil analysis was performed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry instrument. Using the well-diffusion method, investigations on antifungal activity were performed on three clinically isolated specimens of dandruff-causing fungus; namely, Malassezia furfur, Malassezia restricta , and Malassezia globosa . Results: The leaf peels of A. adigratana contained alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and terpenes. The mean moisture, ash, and crude fat levels were 85.69, 92.20, and 8.00%, respectively, whereas the mean total protein and mean total carbohydrate values were 2.59 and 3.04%. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry investigation confirmed the presence of fifteen essential oils. The most prevalent essential oil component was discovered to be phytol (33.78%), followed by decane (11.29%). In a dose-dependent way, the leaf latex and gel extracts prevented the growth of three dandruff-causing Malassezia fungal species ( M. furfur, M. restricta , and M. globosa ). Both the latex and gel demonstrated the maximum activity on M. globosa , the most prevalent fungus in the research area, with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 0.24 and 0.48 mg/mL and minimum fungicidal concentrations of 0.48 and 0.97 mg/mL, respectively. Conclusion: In general, the proximate and essential oil compositions of A. adigratana leaves were comparable to those of other Aloe species widely used in the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries, implying that A. adigratana could be a potential future plant for such industries. Keywords: Aloe adigratana , antifungal activity, dandruff, essential oil, proximate

N2  - The Ethiopian fruit fly (EFF), Dacus ciliatus, is a key, invasive pest of melons in the Middle East. We developed and implemented a novel decision support system (DSS) to manage this pest in a greenhouse environment in Southern Israel. Dacus ciliatus is commonly controlled in Israel with repeated calendar-sprayings (every 15 days) of pyrethroid pesticides. The current study compares the performance of a DSS against calendar-spraying management (CSM). DSS was based on EFF population monitoring and infestation. DSS took into consideration concerns and observations of expert managers and farmers. During 2014, EFF damage was concentrated in the spring melon production season. Fall and winter production did not show important damage. Damage during the spring of 2014 started to increase when average EFF/trap/day reached 0.3. This value was suggested as the threshold to implement pesticide spraying in DSS greenhouses. EFF/trap/day trends were derived from monitoring with conventional traps and a novel electronic remote sensing trap, developed by our group. CSM during the spring of 2015 included 3 EFF control sprays, while DSS-managed greenhouses were only sprayed once. At the end of the spring season, damage was slightly higher in DSS greenhouses (1.5%), but not significantly different to that found in CSM greenhouses (0.5%). Results support continuing DSS research and optimization to reduce/remove pesticide use against EFF in melon greenhouses. Interactions with farmers and managers is suggested as essential to increase adoption of DSS in agriculture.

N2  - Ethiopian agriculture is dominated by small holder farmers with an average per capita land holding of less than a hectare. The production system mainly depends on rain fed system and low input including fertilizer and pesticides used. In order to characterize the climate of Mieso, Melkassa, and Adami Tulu located in CRV of Ethiopia daily climate data were obtained from MARC for Mieso, Melkassa and Ademi Tulu and used for characterization using INSTAT V3.37. The mean start, end of season and length of growing season (LGS) are found to be May 26, September 14, and 99 days at Mieso site; May 27, October 1st and 97 days at Melkassa site; May 26, September 11, and 109 days in Adami Tulu site. The rainy days ranged from 92-165, 92-147, and 92-110 days in Mieso, Melkassa and Adami Tulu, respectively. Hence, developing new varieties and use of appropriate soil moisture conserving tillage practices will enhance adaptation capacity of farmers under changing climate in CRV of Ethiopia. The changes in rainfall conditions have a direct and immediate impact on the performance of agricultural sector as well as on the country’s total GDP. In order to characterize the climate of Mieso, Melkassa, and Adami Tulu located in CRV of Ethiopia daily climate data were obtained from MARC for Mieso, Melkassa and Ademi Tulu and used for characterization using INSTAT V3.37. The seasonal mean rainfall at Mieso, Melkassa and Adami Tulu is 438, 577.7 and 430.3 mm. The probability of occurrence of dry spell lengths of 5, 7, 10, and 15 days reaches minimum value during the peak rainy months and then starts to increase after the end of the rains. Generally, for the study periods the probability of longer dry spells increases rapidly from first dekadal of September onwards. To take risks of longer dry spells and decide to plant during earliest months of the season, farmers should get access to irrigation and also other mechanisms that minimize the loss of moisture from the farm land.

N2  - Domestic and wild animal population movements are important in the spread of disease. There are many recent examples of disease spread that have occurred as a result of intentional movements of livestock or wildlife. Understanding the volume of these movements and the risks associated with them is fundamental in elucidating the epidemiology of these diseases, some of which might entail zoonotic risks. The importance of the worldwide animal trade is reviewed and the role of the unregulated trade in animals is highlighted. A range of key examples are discussed in which animal movements have resulted in the introduction of pathogens to previously disease-free areas. Measures based on heightened surveillance are proposed that mitigate the risks of new pathogen introductions. Domestic and wild animal population movements are important in the spread of disease. There are many recent examples of disease spread that have occurred as a result of intentional movements of livestock or wildlife. Understanding the volume of these movements and the risks associated with them is fundamental in elucidating the epidemiology of these diseases, some of which might entail zoonotic risks. The importance of the worldwide animal trade is reviewed and the role of the unregulated trade in animals is highlighted. A range of key examples are discussed in which animal movements have resulted in the introduction of pathogens to previously disease-free areas. Measures based on heightened surveillance are proposed that mitigate the risks of new pathogen introductions. Infectious diseases are transmitted between hosts by a variety of mechanisms, including direct, airborne and vector-borne transmission. Control of animal-to-animal transmission of disease agents is a key concept in infectious disease epidemiology; however, a more sensible approach might be to prevent the types of contact that lead to transmission in the first place. In humans, it is often difficult to prevent contacts, particularly with the ease of long-distance travel [1Wilson M.E. Travel and the emergence of infectious diseases.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1995; 1: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar]. However, in livestock and animals, movements can be the subject of legislation or strict controls and there is a real opportunity to reduce disease transmission. The importance of animal movements is, of course, well understood and international regulations [e.g. from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE; Box 1) ] exist to mitigate the risks involved [2Kellar J.A. The application of risk analysis to international trade in animal products.Rev. Sci. Tech. 1993; 12: 1023-1044PubMed Google Scholar]. In spite of these regulations, outbreaks occur regularly as a result of both legal and illegal animal movements.Useful web addressesInternational organizationsFood and Agriculture Organization: www.fao.orgWorld Health Organization: www.who.intWorld Organization for Animal Health: www.oie.intWorld Trade Organization: www.wto.intAfrican Union–Inter African Bureau for Animal Research: www.au-ibar.orgOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development: www.oecd.orgInternational regulatory bodiesCouncil of Europe: www.coe.intEuropean Union: europa.eu.intConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora: www.cites.orgWorld Conservation Union: www.iucn.orgConvention on Biological Diversity: www.biodiv.orgInternational Air Transport Association: www.iata.orgNational regulatory and research bodiesUnited Kingdom Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: www.defra.gov.ukUnited Kingdom PET Passport Scheme: www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/index.htmUnited Kingdom Foresight Project: www.foresight.gov.ukUnited States Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service: www.aphis.usda.govUnited States Centers for Disease Control: www.cdc.govUniversity of Edinburgh: www.ed.ac.uk Food and Agriculture Organization: www.fao.org World Health Organization: www.who.int World Organization for Animal Health: www.oie.int World Trade Organization: www.wto.int African Union–Inter African Bureau for Animal Research: www.au-ibar.org Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development: www.oecd.org Council of Europe: www.coe.int European Union: europa.eu.int Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora: www.cites.org World Conservation Union: www.iucn.org Convention on Biological Diversity: www.biodiv.org International Air Transport Association: www.iata.org United Kingdom Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: www.defra.gov.uk United Kingdom PET Passport Scheme: www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/index.htm United Kingdom Foresight Project: www.foresight.gov.uk United States Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service: www.aphis.usda.gov United States Centers for Disease Control: www.cdc.gov University of Edinburgh: www.ed.ac.uk In this review, we examine several issues that relate to the movement of domestic and wild animals and discuss the risks that these movements entail – at local, regional and global scales – with regard to the spread of disease. First, we present data on livestock movements at a global level, and highlight the scale of wildlife movements as a result of translocation by humans. Second, we provide key case studies of animal and animal-to-human (zoonotic) disease introductions in different parts of the world that have resulted in subsequent disease transmission and new outbreaks, with an emphasis on how introduction of the disease agents could have been prevented either through intervention or regulation. The trade in livestock, wildlife and animal products is enormous and complex, and occurs on many different scales. There are no overriding rules to control these movements and much of the trade is still based on bilateral agreements between countries. However, countries that are members of the World Trade Organization are bound by the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement (http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/sps_e/spsagr_e.htm), which concerns food safety and animal and plant health regulations. Countries are encouraged to base their sanitary and phytosanitary measures on existing international standards. The international standards relating to animal health and zoonoses were developed by the OIE and are stated in the aquatic and terrestrial animal health codes (http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/fcode/en_index.htm and http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mcode/a_summry.htm, respectively). The aim of the codes is to assure the sanitary safety of the international trade in terrestrial animals and their products by detailing the health measures that should be used by the veterinary authorities. The important role of a good veterinary infrastructure to minimize the risks of disease spread has been emphasized [3Thiermann A. Emerging diseases and implications for global trade.Rev. Sci. Tech. 2004; 23: 701-707PubMed Google Scholar]. The relevant legislation for international wildlife trade [4Cooper M.E. Rosser A.M. International regulation of wildlife trade: relevant legislation and organisations.Rev. Sci. Tech. 2002; 21: 103-123PubMed Google Scholar] relates to three main areas: animal health, animal welfare and the international movement of endangered species. The animal health regulations relevant for livestock trade (see earlier) also apply to non-domesticated animals. However, additional regulations exist for wildlife to protect endangered species from overexploitation from trade, in the form of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Detailed guidelines have also been developed by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) to minimize disease risks associated with the intentional movement of wildlife for conservation or game management purposes: for example, the supplementation of populations, reintroduction of endangered species, removal of problem animals and the release of confiscated animals [4Cooper M.E. Rosser A.M. International regulation of wildlife trade: relevant legislation and organisations.Rev. Sci.

Open table in a new tab The international trade in livestock is big business; for example, in 1996, China exported US$ 48 million, US$ 294 million and US$ 121 million worth of cattle, swine and poultry, respectively [5Carter, C.A. and Li, X. (1999) Economic reform and the changing pattern of China's agricultural trade (working paper no. 99-003). Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, University of California, Davis. http://ideas.repec.org/p/cdl/aredav/1044.htmlGoogle Scholar]. In 1999, Sudan exported 1 616 363 sheep, 435 cattle, 40 501 goats and 159 483 camels, mainly to Egypt and the Middle East [6Aklilu, Y. et al.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Global Livestock Production and Health Atlas (GLiPHA; http://www.fao.org/ag/aga/glipha/index.jsp) also provides data on live livestock imports for most countries of the world. For example, Australia exported 895 982 heads of cattle, 5 421 408 sheep, 2976 horses, and 5 asses in 2000 (Table 2), with large numbers of live sheep exported to the Middle East [7Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2000) Monthly Statistics of International Trade OECD (vols. 2000-1–2000-12). http://lysander.sourceoecd.org/Google Scholar].Table 2Examples of the volume of live imports of different livestock species from a range of countries in 2002aSource: FAO GLiPHA, available at http://www.fao.org/ag/aga/glipha.CountrySheepPigsChickensCattleBelgium52 261693 891136 25461 054UK0231 42735125966USA139 1625 741 27569522 505 279China30221163100211 432Brazil4951368137219 242Mozambique2876867841809Egypt68 195Data not available553792 492India0943204674Philippines44713662529117 146a Source: FAO GLiPHA, available at http://www.fao.org/ag/aga/glipha. Open table in a new tab Unregulated (illegal or informal) trade is, by its nature, difficult to quantify, although available data for some regions of the world show that unregulated trade is substantial. Although there are no official records, it has been documented that, for example, 75 000 head of cattle move from Somalia to Kenya annually, and that up to 850 000 goats move from Somalia to the Middle East (which accounts for >95% of all goat imports from the eastern Africa region) [8Little, P. (2005) Unofficial trade when States are weak: the case of cross-border commerce in the Horn of Africa (research paper of UNU-WIDER No. 2005/13). Expert Group on Development Issues (EGDI), World Institute for Development Economics Research (WIDER), United Nations University. http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/publications.htmGoogle Scholar]. Indeed, in the case of cattle trading with Kenya, political instability resulted in a large increase in the value of unofficial trade. This coincided with a collapse in the animal health infrastructure of Somalia and a resulting lack of animal export controls. Diseases known to have been circulating in Somalia include both zoonotic and non-zoonotic infectious diseases: anthrax, babesiosis, brucellosis, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, contagious caprine pleuropneumonia, foot and mouth disease (FMD), heartwater, peste des petits ruminants, rabies, Rift Valley fever, rinderpest and trypanosomiasis, among others [9Food and Agriculture Organization (2004) Somalia: towards a livestock sector strategy – final report (Report No. 04/001 IC–SOM) FAO/World Bank/European Union http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOMALIAEXTN/Resources/so_LS_final_rpt.pdfGoogle Scholar]. Unofficially traded animals are a much greater risk factor for disease spread because they are not necessarily subject to veterinary controls. It has been reported that much of the human brucellosis problem in Saudi Arabia, which has an incidence of 40 cases per 100 000 people nationally, is the result of unscreened and unregulated imports that come mainly from Africa [10Memish Z. Brucellosis control in Saudi Arabia: prospects and challenges.J. Chemother. 2001; 13: 11-17PubMed Google Scholar]. The picture that emerges from a consideration of these various data sources is one of a highly interconnected world in which animals move locally, regionally and across large international distances. The global wildlife trade is also huge, with an annual turnover estimated at billions of dollars and involving hundreds of millions of individual plants and animals (http://www.traffic.org/25/wild1.htm). Precise estimates of its scale are difficult because much is conducted through informal or illegal networks but recent figures suggest that ∼40 000 live primates, four million live birds, 640 000 live reptiles and 350 million live tropical fish are traded globally each year [11Karesh W.B. et al.Wildlife trade and global disease emergence.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. In Asia, the substantial regional trade in wild animals is estimated to result in several billion direct and indirect contacts among wildlife, humans and domestic animals each year [11Karesh W.B. et al.Wildlife trade and global disease emergence.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11: 1000-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Despite the widespread recognition of the risks of disease transmission associated with wildlife translocation, and the legislation and regulation in place to minimize disease risks [4Cooper M.E. Rosser A.M. International regulation of wildlife trade: relevant legislation and organisations.Rev. Sci. Tech. 2002; 21: 103-123PubMed Google Scholar, 12Woodford M.H. International disease implications for wildlife translocation.J. Zoo Wildl. Med. 1993; 24: 265-270Google Scholar, 13Cunningham A.A. Disease risks of wildlife translocations.Conserv. Biol. 1996; 10: 349-353Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 14Daszak P. et al.Emerging infectious diseases of wildlife – threats to biodiversity and human health.Science. 2000; 287: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar], new diseases continue to emerge as a result of wildlife trade. Here, we present key examples from the past five years that illustrate the continuing threat to human, livestock and wildlife health. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and highly pathogenic avian influenza (e.g. H5N1) are emerging infections that have the potential for pandemic spread with massive public health and economic consequences. Both diseases are maintained in wildlife reservoir hosts: H5N1 in wild fowl and SARS in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus species) in China [15Li W. et al.Bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-like Coronaviruses.Science. 2005; 310: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 16Lau S.K. et al.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like virus in Chinese horseshoe bats.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14040-14045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar]. For SARS, the trade in bats is likely to have brought infected animals into contact with susceptible amplifying hosts such as the masked palm civet (Parguma larvata) at some point in the wildlife supply chain, establishing a market cycle in which susceptible people and animals could subsequently become infected [15Li W. et al.Bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-like Coronaviruses.Science. 2005; 310: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar, 16Lau S.K. et al.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-like virus in Chinese horseshoe bats.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14040-14045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar]. For avian influenza, these 'wet markets' could also function as network hubs for potential cross-species transmission. However, the international trade in birds also poses considerable risks for long-distance transmission of H5N1, as highlighted by the detection of infected hawk eagles imported illegally from Thailand to Belgium [17Van Borm S. et al.Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in smuggled Thai eagles, Belgium.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11: 702-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar]. The disease risks of the wild bird trade have been brought into sharp relief by the importation of H5N1-infected birds destined for the UK pet market [18National Emergency Epidemiology GroupEpidemiology Report on Avian Influenza in a Quarantine Premises in Essex. Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (UK), 2005Google Scholar] and, at the time of submission of this review, a temporary ban on the importation of wild birds had been implemented by the UK government. The recent detection of Pseudamphistomum truncatum (an opisthorchid fluke parasite) in the English otter population has been linked with the introduction of two freshwater fishes: the sunbleak (Leucaspius delineatus) and the topmouth gudgeon (Pseudorasbora parva), which can function as intermediate hosts for the fluke. These species were newly introduced into the UK by an ornamental fish supplier in Hampshire in the mid-1980s and their escape led to the colonization of many river systems in southern England [19Pinder A.C. Gozlan R.E. Sunbleak and topmouth gudgeon - two new additions to Britain's freshwater fishes.British Wildlife. 2003; 15: 77-83Google Scholar]. The translocation of amphibians is implicated in the emergence of amphibian diseases such as chytridiomycosis and ranavirus infections, which might be a major contributing factor in the widespread decline and extinction of amphibian species worldwide [20Daszak P. et al.Emerging infectious diseases and amphibian population declines.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar]. Chytridiomycosis, which has been associated with amphibian mortalities and population declines in Central America and Australia, has also been linked to the introduction of cane toads (Bufo marinus) into Australia [20Daszak P. et al.Emerging infectious diseases and amphibian population declines.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar]. Also, chytridiomycosis has appeared recently in the UK, with confirmed cases in an established breeding population of North American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), which is an introduced species [21Cunningham A.A. et al.Emergence of amphibian chytridiomycosis in Britain.Vet. Rec. 2005; 157: 386-387PubMed Google Scholar]. Recent movements of R. catesbeiana and B. marinus might also have disseminated ranaviral diseases such as tadpole oedema virus [20Daszak P. et al.Emerging infectious diseases and amphibian population declines.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 1999; 5: 735-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar]. In Australia, where B. marinus was introduced to Queensland in 1935, ranaviral antibodies can be identified in this species throughout its geographic range [22Zupanovic Z. et al.Giant toads Bufo marinus in Australia and Venezuela have antibodies against 'ranaviruses'.Dis. Aquat. Organ. 1998; 32: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar]. In addition to the well-recognized threat that animal translocations and invasions into new geographic areas pose for species extinctions and biodiversity, the large wildlife trade clearly poses great dangers for the emergence of human and animal pathogens. It is doubtful whether the disease risks associated with the international wildlife trade, let alone additional welfare and conservation-related problems, can ever be justified simply to supply a demand for pets or recreational hunting. The dilemma is perhaps more acute in areas where the wildlife trade is associated with food and medicines, particularly in Asia, where the trade could be an important element in rural livelihoods and food security. In addition, translocation of wildlife can be an important tool for both conservation and animal welfare. In February 2000, the UK adopted the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) to enable pets with the appropriate documentation to move between the UK and certain countries. This represented the first major change in UK quarantine regulations since the 1901 Importation of Dogs Act. The scheme is primarily designed to prevent the importation of rabies, with secondary measures to prevent the introduction of the cestode parasite Echinococcus multilocularis, which is currently endemic in continental Europe and can be transmitted from canids to humans to cause potentially fatal alveolar echinococcosis. Eighty-one countries now qualify under the scheme but quarantine remains the only option for non-listed countries. The PETS is a model for the use of legislation to minimize risks: the risks of importing rabies under the scheme are small. However, other zoonotic diseases continue to pose a substantial risk and there are few formal checks for these under the system. Figure 1 shows the volume of dog and cat movements into the UK following the introduction of the PETS. Leishmania infantum is the predominant cause of both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis throughout the Mediterranean region, including southern France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Turkey and North Africa [23Trotz-Williams L.A. Trees A.J. Systematic review of the distribution of the major vector-borne parasitic infections in dogs and cats in Europe.Vet. Rec. 2003; 152: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar]; the main reservoir host is the domestic dog. Seropositivity rates of canine leishmaniasis can be >30% [24Ferroglio E. et al.Canine leishmaniasis, Italy.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2005; 11: 1618-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar] in the Mediterranean, with patterns of infection that reflect the distribution of the sand fly vector (Phelobotomus species) [25Trees A. Shaw S. Imported diseases in small animals.In Pract. 1999; 21: 482-491Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 26Bongiorno G. et al.Host preferences of phlebotomine sand flies at a hypoendemic focus of canine leishmaniasis in central Italy.Acta Trop. 2003; 88: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar]. In Brazil, where canine visceral leishmaniasis is an important emerging disease, canine infection in endemic areas can be as high as 67% [27Moreira E.D. et al.Assessment of an optimized dog-culling program in the dynamics of canine Leishmania transmission.Vet. Parasitol. 2004; 122: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar]. To control the disease, a mass culling of seropositive dogs has been adopted in several areas but has not been effective [28Courtenay O. et al.Infectiousness in a cohort of Brazilian dogs: why culling fails to control visceral leishmaniasis in areas of high transmission.J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 1314-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar]. A feasible alternative to culling dogs is to fit collars treated with the insecticide deltamethrin; preliminary results have shown a large drop in the number of bites by sand flies and infection rates in dogs [29Halbig P. et al.Further evidence that deltamethrin-impregnated collars protect domestic dogs from sandfly bites.Med. Vet. Entomol. 2000; 14: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Killick-Kendrick R. et al.Protection of dogs from bites of phlebotomine sandflies by deltamethrin collars for control of canine leishmaniasis.Med. Vet. Entomol. 1997; 11: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31Reithinger R. et al.Are insecticide-impregnated dog collars a feasible alternative to dog culling as a strategy for controlling canine visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil?.Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar]. This might be the only way to control the increasing spread of canine visceral leishmaniasis and could be recommended as a control measure for dogs leaving and re-entering the UK under PETS. Quarantine is not effective in preventing the introduction of leishmaniasis due to the long incubation period of the disease. Outbreaks of leishmaniasis have occurred in dogs in the USA as a result of Mediterranean-based military personnel who have returned home with their pets. In addition, there has been an apparent increase in the incidence of leishmaniasis in US hunting dogs [32Enserink M. Infectious diseases – has Leishmaniasis become endemic in the US?.Science. 2000; 290: 1881-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar] – although the cause remains unclear, it could be a result of either animal movements or spread of the vector. The chances of leishmaniasis becoming established in domestic dogs in the UK are small because, currently, Phelobotomus species are not known to be present in the UK. However, if climate change does affect air temperatures substantially, the sand fly vector could become established in the UK and, potentially, could maintain endemic leishmaniasis and other 'exotic' parasitic diseases [33Martens W.J.M. et al.Sensitivity of malaria, schistosomiasis and dengue to global warming.Clim. Change. 1997; 35: 145-156Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar], the introduction of which would probably result from the movement of domestic pets. In addition to leishmaniasis, diseases such as heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis), babesiosis (Babesia canis), ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia canis) and echinococcosis (Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis) are all likely to be moved with domestic pets into the UK and elsewhere [23Trotz-Williams L.A. Trees A.J. Systematic review of the distribution of the major vector-borne parasitic infections in dogs and cats in Europe.Vet. Rec. 2003; 152: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34Genchi C. et al.Is heartworm disease really spreading in Europe?.Vet. Parasitol. 2005; 133: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar]. The responsibility falls on domestic pet owners in such a situation who should ensure the use of anthelminthics – agents that destroy or expel parasitic intestinal worms – and, possibly, insecticide-treated collars. Owners should also be advised about preventative measures before pet travel. E. multilocularis is common in red foxes in Hokkaido, northern Japan, where the prevalence of infection in foxes is as high as 40% and high worm burdens are recorded in some individuals [35Konno K. et al.Prevention of alveolar echinococcosis – ecosystem and risk management perspectives in Japan.Acta Trop. 2003; 89: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar]. DNA sequencing of parasite isolates from this area show that it was probably introduced in the 1960s from a neighbouring island [36Satoh M. et al.Short report: Echinococcus multilocularis confirmed on Kunashiri Island, 15 kilometers from the eastern part of Hokkaido, Japan.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2005; 72: 284-288PubMed Google Scholar] through the movement of infected foxes. This disease now presents an important public health problem, with a human incidence of 0.33 per 100 000 people [35Konno K. et al.Prevention of alveolar echinococcosis – ecosystem and risk management perspectives in Japan.Acta Trop. 2003; 89: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar], or ∼10 cases annually. Domestic dogs have become part of the transmission cycle and close contact between humans and their pets is a major risk factor. A recent risk analysis [37Doi R. et al.Nippon Koshu Eisei Zasshi. 2003; 50: 639-649PubMed Google Scholar] showed that the movement of pet animals between Hokkaido and the rest of Japan is likely to result in further geographical spread of the parasite, particularly because there are few movement controls or programmes for screening and treatment. Rabies is a prime example of an infectious disease in which transmission can be enhanced by animal movements. Flores Island in Indonesia was free of rabies until 1997 [38Windiyaningsih C. et al.The rabies epidemic on Flores Island, Indonesia (1998–2003).J. Med. Assoc. Thai. 2004; 87: 1389-1393PubMed Google Scholar]; in that year, three dogs were imported from a rabies-endemic area and this was sufficient to result in 113 human deaths (mainly children) and the culling of almost 50% of the dog population in some areas as part of an unsuccessful control campaign [39Bingham J. Rabies on Flores Island, Indonesia: is eradication possible in the near future?.in: Dodet B. Meslin F.-X. Fourth International Symposium on Rabies Control in Asia. John Libbey, 2001: 148-155Google Scholar]. Flores Island is now endemic for rabies, which has become a major public health issue, and dealing w

N2  - Background . Echinops kebericho is an endemic medicinal plant in Ethiopia widely used in the treatment of infectious and noninfectious diseases. Essential oils are known for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, and antioxidant properties. This study evaluated the antifungal activity of essential oil from E. kebericho against four common pathogenic fungi and two standard strains. Methods . The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation. The antifungal screening was done by agar well diffusion method. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution. Minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were determined by subculturing fungal strains with no visible growth onto a Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) plate. Results . Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans were highly sensitive while Aspergillus flavus did not show sensitivity up to 1 mg/ml of essential oil; MICs ranged from 0.083 mg/ml to 0.208 mg/ml. Concentration and fungal species showed significant dose‐dependent associations ( p &lt; 0.0001) with antifungal activity. The MICs of essential oil were comparable to those of the standard drug (fluconazole) against C. glabrata and C. krusei. The lowest MFC of the essential oil was observed against Candida parapsilosis (0.145 mg/ml) while the highest MFC was against Candida krusei (0.667 mg/ml). Conclusion . Echinops kebericho essential oil showed noteworthy antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans , and Candida glabrata and could be a potential candidate for further antifungal drug development.

N2  - Background: Lippia adoensis var. koseret is a well known medicinal plant endemic to Ethiopia. It has been traditionally used to treat different infectious diseases and also in food preparation as condiment. The aim of the current study was to evaluate antibacterial and antifungal activities of water, ethanol and methanol based crude extracts of L. adoensis var. koseret against selected human pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Methods: Crude extracts of L. adoensis var. koseret were extracted by maceration method. Disc diffusion assay of the extracts were carried out in four different concentrations against three different bacteria species (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Escherichia coli) and two clinical isolated fungal species (Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus) by using Kirby- Baur disk diffusion method. Agar dilution method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration, the minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations of the extracts against similar microorganisms. Results: Water-based extract of L. adoensis var. koseret exhibited significantly less antimicrobial activity as compared to ethanol and methanol crude extract against tested isolates of bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05); while, there was no significant difference between ethanol and methanol extracts. Among the tested microorganism S. aureus, was the most sensitive of all whereas C. albicans was the most resistant microorganism to alcohol based extract of L. adoensis var. koseret. The minimum inhibitory concentration of L. adoensis var. koseret ranged from 3.12 to 25mg/ml in the alcohol based extracts but it was higher in the water-based extract. The lower bactericidal concentration (5.20 mg/l) and the highest fungicidal concentration (37.50 mg/ml) were observed in methanol based extracts against S. aureus and C. albicans, respectively. Conclusions: Antimicrobial activity of L. adoensis var. koseret varies with extraction solvent and tested microorganisms.

N2  - Tef is among the major cereal crops in the Horn of Africa particularly in Ethiopia where it is number one in terms of land allocated to its cultivation. This crop is the major staple food crop to most of the Ethiopian people living in the highlands which comprise more than 65% of the population. This study was aimed at analyzing farmers’ perception towards improved Quncho teff varieties and constraints faced in producing improved teff variety in Gindeberet district. A descriptive survey design was adopted in which 150 respondents were randomly selected from six Peasant association of the district to collect the required data. The study result revealed that depending on the items developed for this study among the given agreements perception on high yield potential of the variety, increase production and yield, availability of the technology on production and agro-ecological suitability of the variety had showed relatively best performance of the varieties, whereas availability of the improved seed at the right time with its quality and disease resistance of the crop indicates relatively poorest agreement compared to all other characteristics of level of agreements considered. The overall finding revealed that, the government and other stakeholders should invest in farmer training since it enables farmers to understand well technologies and perceive their benefits increasing their probability to adopt agricultural technologies and provide adequate extension services and solve un availability of improved seed at the right time, high prices of inputs particularly improved seeds, pesticides and fertilizers in the district.

N2  - Abstract Background Insecticide-based vector control, which comprises the use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), is the key method of malaria control in Ethiopia. However, it’s effectiveness is threatened as malaria vectors become resistant to insecticides. Assessing the susceptibility status of these Anopheles mosquitoes at different time is important to complement vector control interventions. However, there is no reports on the insecticide susceptibility status of malaria vectors from Gondar zuria woreda, Northwest Ethiopia. Thus, this study investigated the susceptibility status of malaria vectors in Gondar zuria woreda, Northwest Ethiopia against various insecticides recommended for use in ITNs and/or IRS to provide evidence to suggest alternates for malaria vector control tools. Methods An entomological study was carried out from March 1, 2022, to August 31, 2022. 900 three-day-old adult female Anopheles mosquitoes from larva collected in the field from Gondar zuria district using dipper were used for bioassay and synergist. They were tested for susceptibility to permethrin (0.75%), deltamethrin (0.05%), alpha-cypermethrin (0.05%), propoxur (0.1%), and pirimiphos-methyl (0.25%) by using WHO susceptibility test papers. Baches of 20 and 25 adult female Anopheles mosquitoes were used for both bioassay and synergist assay, respectively. 50%KDT and 90%KDT were determined by logit-probit analysis after 1 hour. One-way ANOVA was used to compare the mean knockdown rates of the Anopheles mosquitoes by insecticides after 60 minutes. An independent sample t-test was used to compare the mean knockdown rates of the Anopheles mosquitoes by pyrethroid insecticide with and without PBO after 60 minutes. Mortality rates pos-24 hours were recorded. Results A total of 900 female Anopheles mosquitoes were examined, of which 878 (97.5%), 15 (1.5%), and 7 (0.7%) were found to be Anopheles Gambae(s.l), Anopheles funestus group , and Anopheles Pharoensis , respectively. They exhibited susceptibility to pirimiphos-methyl (100%) and propoxur (100%), but resistant to permethrin (88.8%), alphacypermethrin (67.5%), and deltamethrin (73.75). Although permethrin restoration was only 96% in permethrin resistant Anopheles mosquitoes, the efficacy of alphacypermethrin and deltamethrin was totally restored by pre-exposure to PBO. Conclusion and recommendation This study demonstrated that malaria vectors are susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl propoxur, and PBO + pyrethroid insecticides but resistant to pyrethroids insecticide-only. It also revealed that Anopheles gambae s.l. , Anopheles funestus group, and Anopheles pharoensis group are malaria vectors in Gondar zuria woreda with Anopheles gambae complex predominating. Based on the findings of this study, it is better to use pyrethroids-impregnated mosquito nets with PBO and/or the use of propoxur and primiphos-methyl to control malaria. Further investigations are needed to better understand the molecular basis of pyrethroids insecticide resistant-malaria vectors.

N2  - The agricultural sector is the basis of livelihood for a large proportion of society in Ethiopia. In the three political regimes in modern Ethiopia, the Imperial, the military and the Ethiopian people revolutionary democratic front (EPRDF), agriculture has been regarded as a critical sector. The Agricultural Development Led Industrialization (ADLI) is the national policy of the country. Regardless of the government policy attention and investment, there is a long way to go for smallholders to ensure food self-sufficiency. Agriculture is the base of our food, transformation to industrialization, climatic change control system. Agriculture is the soul of our sovereignty for development as well as poverty reduction for individuals and country level. In Ethiopia, population density is high and has been increasing and agricultural land has been decreasing because of fragmenting or converting it into residential plots. To meet the domestic food requirements, use of improved production technologies developed by research is come out to be important. Therefore, the goal of this study was to analyze factors that affect the performance of agricultural products in Amahara region national state and to determine the highly significant input factors for producing high and qualified agricultural outputs. Data regarding total agricultural outputs and its input factors in study area of Amahara region from 2010 to 2018 was obtained from Amhara national state branch of the Ethiopian institute of agricultural sector. Correlation analyses were used to examine the strength of the relationship between each of the determinant factors with total agricultural output, while multiple regression analysis was employed to examine the simultaneous effects of several independent variables on the dependent variable, total agricultural outputs. These analyses were employed through the packages R and Stata to achieve the main objectives of the study. All of the independent variables were highly correlated with the total agricultural output. The overall regression model was highly significant (p-value < 0.01) with F = 45.532. The R-squared value implies that 93.8% percent of the changes in average total agricultural outputs are successfully explained by the variables used in the model of this study. If we take model size into account, 91.8% percent of the variation in average total agricultural output was explained by the values of the independent variables. Specifically, among the independent variables irrigated land, fertilizer, improved seed and pesticides are the most significant factors for total products (p-value < 0.05).

N2  - Apiculture is one of the most widely spread agricultural subsectors making substantial contribution to household food security through providing income, quality foods and assets to the rural beekeepers in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is endowed with immense apicultural resources and long standing traditional beekeeping practices. Recently, there is a growing pesticides grievance on honeybee population and their products decline with considerable economic impacts on beekeepers. To ascertain the gripe, field assessment was conducted on pesticides use and its economic impacts on the apiculture subsector in three districts of Amhara region (Dangila, Guangua and Mecha) in April 2014. Random household survey was conducted on a total of 270 respondents (90 per district) of which 137 were beekeepers and 133 none beekeepers. From the total respondents, 147 uses pesticides and Dimethoate 40% EC, Ethiolathion 50%, Karate 5EC, 2,4-D were the most often used pesticides. March, June, July and September are identified as pesticides applications months. From the total pesticides users (147), 114 (78%) apply before flowering stage, 25 both before and during flowering stages and the rest applies whenever they feel pests and/ or weeds occur. Besides, more than 60% of the respondents know pesticides kill honeybees and results in dwindling and absconding. Three years trends analysis of honeybee colony number and honey yield indicated dramatic decline mainly attributed to indiscriminate applications of pesticides. This assessment revealed indiscriminate uses of pesticides caused fatalities on 22987 honeybee colonies and incurred economic loss amounting USD 819291.37. This study is appropriate and timely to develop and implement effective development and extension strategies to minimize and/or control the ill effects of accidentally using pesticides.

N2  - Heavy metal pollution is among the leading health concerns all over the world because of their long-term cumulative effects. khat (Catha edulisforsk), a plant used as a stimulant is grown in certain areas of East Africa and the Arab Peninsula this day it is a known cash crop in Ethiopia. Due to increased demand and value, many farmers have not only begun growing it but have also adopted modern farming methods which include application of fertilizers, pesticides, compost manure, and irrigation. Yet some of these agricultural practices such as application of fertilizers and pesticides are known to increase the concentration of heavy metals such as Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu in the soil. Some of these heavy metals such as Pband Cd are toxic even at low concentrations while Zn, Cu, Fe and Cr though essential in the body, are toxic at high levels This call for monitoring to make sure that the levels of heavy metals in khat do not exceed the threshold limits recommended by WHO due to their adverse health effects to man. This study therefore assesses selected chemical nutrients and toxic metal in khat that is available in Ethiopia. khat samples were collected from16 sits of the three main khat growing regions namely Oromiya, South Nation and Nationality and Amhara regional state Known weights of oven dried khat samples were digested using nitric andPerchloric acids. The digests were analyzed for selected heavy metals using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The following concentration ranges in dry weight (μg/g) were obtained in khat: Zn (25.15-73.95), Cu (0.10-41.80), Cr (ND-39.50), Cd(ND-0.90) and Pb (0.50-13.00). Cd was only detected in khat samples from Oromiyaare more susceptible to adverse effects of Pb than adults. The results suggested that there was significant different (p 0.05) in the levels of heavy metals between khat from various regions. Levels of studied heavy metals in khat were below the maximum limits recommended by WHO except for Pb and Cr Therefore children should be discouraged from chewing khat since they are more susceptible to adverse effects of Pb than adults.

N2  - Garlic is a fundamental component of many dishes in Ethiopia. However, there is a low production of this crop in the Yilmana Densa district of Amhara Region (Ethiopia). Thus, a study was initiated in 2014/2015 to assess farmer's garlic production practices under an irrigated farming system in the Yilmana Densa district (Adet Zuria, Goshaye and Ambesit kebels) of Ethiopia. Production data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires from 30 garlic producing households where the whole value chain of garlic production system were recorded. Results showed that the agronomic and cultural practices employed by farmers contributed to the low productivity of garlic. Major constraints of garlic production include lack of suitable irrigated land, lack of quality planting material, shortage of irrigation water, fertilizers and pesticides, lack of money for input purchase, and disease incidences (white rot). For enhancement of production and productivity of garlic, it is necessary to solve problems associated with the production of garlic through extension activities. Key words: Bulb yield, households, garlic grower, productivity, water productivity.

N2  - Abstract Lake Ziway is shallow freshwater located in Northern part of Ethiopian Rift Valley. It is characterized as semi-arid to sub-humid type of climate. Expansions of the flower industry, widespread fisheries, intensive agricultural activities, fast population growth lead to deterioration of water quality and depletion of aquatic biota. In this study, spatial and temporal variations of selected water quality parameters of Lake Ziway were evaluated using multivariate statistical techniques in the study periods of 2014 and 2015. Monthly water quality data were collected from nine sampling stations during dry and wet seasonal basis for analysis of 15 water quality parameters. Mean nutrient concentrations showed increasing trend and were higher in Floriculture effluent (Fb) and Floriculture effluent after mixing in the lake (Fa) in all seasons. These sites were also characterized by high electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS). All the nine sampling sites were categorized into three pollution levels according to their water quality features using cluster analysis (CA). Accordingly, sampling sites Fb and Ketar River (Kb) are highly and moderately polluted in both seasons, respectively. On the other hand, sampling sites at the center (C), Meki river mouth (Ma), Ketar river mouth (Ka), Meki River (Mb), Korekonch (K o ) and Fa in dry season and Ka, C, Ma, Ko, Bulbula river mouth (B) and Fa during wet season were less polluted. Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis also showed the pollutant sources were mainly from Fb during dry season Mb and Kb during wet season. The values of comprehensive pollution index illustrated the lake is moderately and slightly polluted in dry and wet seasons, respectively. Comparatively, the pollution status of the lake is high around floriculture effluent discharge site and at the two feeding rivers (Kb and Mb) due to increasing trends in agrochemical loads. This may lead to long term ecological changes in the lake unless possible measures taken.

N2  - Abstract. The traditional tillage implement, the Maresha plow, and the tillage systems that require repeated and cross plowing have caused poor rainfall partitioning, land degradation and hence low water productivity in Ethiopia. Conservation tillage could alleviate these problems. However, no-till can not be feasible for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions of Ethiopia because of difficulties in maintaining soil cover due to low rainfall and communal grazing and because of high costs of herbicides. Strip tillage systems may offer a solution. This study was initiated to test strip tillage systems using implements that were modified forms of the Maresha plow, and to evaluate the impacts of the new tillage systems on water balance and grain yields of maize (Zea mays XX). Experiments were conducted in two dry semi arid areas called Melkawoba and Wulinchity, in the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia during 2003–2005. Strip tillage systems that involved cultivating planting lines at a spacing of 0.75 m using the Maresha plow followed by subsoiling along the same lines (STS) and without subsoiling (ST) were compared with the traditional tillage system of 3 to 4 times plowing with the Maresha plow (CONV). Soil moisture was monitored to a depth of 1.8 m using Time Domain Reflectometer while surface runoff was measured using rectangular trough installed at the bottom of each plot. STS resulted in the least surface runoff (Qs=17 mm-season−1), the highest transpiration (T=196 mm-season−1), the highest grain yields (Y=2130 kg-ha−1) and the highest water productivity using total evaporation (WPET=0.67 kg-m−3) followed by ST (Qs=25 mm-season−1, T=178 mm-season−1, Y=1840 kg-ha−1, WPET=0.60 kg-m−3) and CONV (Qs=40 mm-season−1,T=158 mm-season−1, Y=1720 kg-ha−1, WPET=0.58 kg-m−3). However, when the time between the last tillage operation and planting of maize was more than 26 days, the reverse occurred. There was no statistically significant change in soil physical and chemical properties after three years of experimenting with different tillage systems.

N2  - Only two to three percent of total water on earth is fresh water, and groundwater constitutes a significant portion of the fresh water resources. This scars and fragile resource is under the risk of degradation in both quality and quantity in many parts of the world. Three major activities cause large quantities of human and industrial waste disposals, and hence, pose serious threat to the groundwater resources. The first of these activities is excessive use of fertilizers, pesticides and automation in agricultural areas. The second one is unregulated discharge of natural and artificial chemical substances to the environment. Finally, excessive pumping and improper management of aquifers result in reducing the pumping potential and degrading the water quality. In order to mitigate the influence of such detrimental effects, precise delineations of the aquifer system and of the hydrogeological setting in concern areas are of primary importance. In those areas, vulnerable to such adverse environmental problems, two types of remedies have been proposed. The first type is called the reactive approach which involves aquifer remediation after the contamination occurred. The preferred proactive approach, on the other hand, calls for taking the necessary measures before the contaminants reach the groundwater surface. The reactive method of aquifer remediation suffers from unsatisfactory results since it is impossible to obtain 100% purification. The proactive method mainly involves identifying the pollutant source at an early stage and assessing the potential danger it poses to the ground water system. Geographic Information System (GIS) has been proven as an effective tool for this purpose. As in this research, Chitsazan and Akhtari (2009) and Awawdeh and Jaradat (2009) determined the risk of pollutants to contaminate the groundwater, with the help of GIS. In recent years the increase in the popularity of applying environmental criteria in national planning and management has provided a wide range of scientific approaches to determine the best location of hazardous wastes to be land filled (Abessi and Saeedi 2009). This method is applied in many countries, such as Palestine (Baalousha 2006) Ethiopia (Tilahun and Merkel 2009) Tunisia (Saidi et al 2009), both to determine the suitable solid waste areas and to dispose other contaminants. For example, it is a preliminary assessment of the possible environmental impact of a proposed landfill facility for the city of Jammu City in India (Nagar and Mirza 2002). The researches on aquifer vulnerability is increasing

N2  - Potato is an important tuberous vegetable crop in Ethiopia. However, its production is constrained by arthropod pests, nutrient depletion of soil and diseases. Among arthropod pests, two-spotted spider mite (TSSM, Tetranychus urticae) is one of the major arthropod pests affecting potato production and contributing to low yield in eastern Hararghe, Ethiopia. To tackle this problem, the survey was undertaken to assess the distribution, farmers’ management practices and their perception of TSSM on the irrigated potato. The data were collected from ninety-six potato producers during the dry season in Haramaya, Kombolcha, Kersa and Metta districts of Eastern Hararghe Zone by interviewing, observing and recording from October to March in 2018/2019. The meteorological data were obtained from the National meteorological agency, Jijiga station. The number of TSSM/potato plants, prevalence, incidence and severity levels of potato were analyzed using three-stage nested design. Farmers’ perceptions and practices were analyzed by using descriptive statistics, while the relationship of weather factors and altitude with the status of TSSM was analyzed using SPSS software program version 16.0 and determination of Pearson correlation was done using SPSS statistical software. This assessment confirmed that TSSM was found in all the districts with variation in number per potato leaves, incidence and severity levels. The highest incidence (37.88%), severity (3), number of TSSM/potato (39) per plant was scored from Haramaya district and the lowest was recorded from Kombolcha district. Based on the observation and response of the respondents, the TSSM was mostly prevailed in autumn (44.79%) but was the lowest in spring seasons (6.25%). It severely affected the potato production at flowering stages (44.2%). But the lowest damage was at seedling stage (7.4%). Data on farmer’s perception also showed that 60% of them recognized TSSM on potato plants. The linear correlation coefficient indicated that the incidence (r=-0.546, Y=-0.548X+38.7), number of TSSM/potato plant (r=-0.847,Y=-0.06.232X+38.24) and severity level (r=-0.431,Y=-0.0221X+2.805) was decreased as rainfall intensity increased. The studies suggested that provision of resistant variety of potato, chemical pesticides, water supply will help the farmers to increase the production and productivity of potato by decreasing the yield losses due to TSSM. Further research on the seasonal abundance, effect of microclimate, natural enemies and management practices on the population dynamics of TSSM in the major potato growing areas of eastern part of Ethiopia was suggested from the study.

N2  - Prevalence, Influence on Anemia and Associated Factors in West Guji Zone, Ethiopia -A Community-Based Study" really attracted our attention because it focuses on risk factors for the incidence of asymptomatic malaria in pregnant women, which can be used as a basis for building early awareness, so that possible complications such as anemia, abortion and premature birth can be prevented.In this case, researchers found 5 significant risk factors, namely living near stagnant water, history of plasmodium infection, not using indoor residual spray, no outdoor vector control and not using insecticide-treated nets; and 2 factors that are not significant, namely residence and mosquito repellant. 1n this study, researchers used regression analysis so that the hypothesis assumed that the seven factors had a direct effect on the incidence of asymptomatic malaria.From another point of view, logically and technically we can also analyze the possibility of indirect effects of several factors on the incidence of asymptomatic malaria through intermediate variables.For example, in regression analysis, residence is not proven to be a direct risk factor, so we can confirm whether residence has an indirect effect through intermediate variables, such as "outdoor vector control" or "living near stagnant water".So that schematically we can determine the effect pathways, namely: "residence → outdoor vector control → malaria" or "residence → living near stagnant water → malaria".Next, an analysis is carried out according to the effect pathways depicted in the scheme.In this case, "path analysis" is one method that can be chosen. 2,3herefore, to obtain information about the direct and indirect effects of these factors, we recommend that further analysis be carried out by first drawing a diagram of the effect paths between factors, then carrying out path analysis based on that diagram.It is hoped that the results of this further analysis will add more in-depth information, so that efforts to control risk factors for malaria in pregnant women become more accurate, which in the end can reduce the number of complications due to malaria in pregnant women.

N2  - Background. Malaria remains a serious public health problem, particularly in resource scarce areas of the world. The number of malaria cases has dropped remarkably in Ethiopia over the last decade, and efforts to eliminate the disease are underway. Asymptomatic infections may pose significant challenges to the elimination program. The essence of this study was to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infection and the associated factors among communities of the selected districts in the Kaffa zone. Materials and Methods. April to May and September to October 2021, were the two seasons in which the community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted. Capillary blood from a finger prick was examined by light microscopy (LM) and screened using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). The participants’ sociodemographic characteristics and malaria prevention measures were collected using a pretested semistructured questionnaire. Data entry and analyses were carried out using EpiData and SPSS version 25.0. Logistic regression (bivariate and multivariable) analyses were carried out to assess the possible associations between the dependent variable and the associated factors. Results. 566 study participants were involved in the two cross-sectional surveys, including 234 male and 332 female subjects with a mean age of 18.486 (SD ± 15.167). Thirty-eight blood samples (6.7%) were found to be positive for Plasmodium species tested by both LM and RDT. Last night’s use of long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) (AOR = 2.448, 95% CI: 1.009 5.938, <a:math xmlns:a="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1"><a:mi>p</a:mi><a:mo>=</a:mo><a:mn>0.048</a:mn></a:math> ), presence of eave (AOR = 4.144, 95% CI: 1.049–16.363, <c:math xmlns:c="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M2"><c:mi>p</c:mi><c:mo>=</c:mo><c:mn>0.043</c:mn></c:math> ), and house sprayed in the last year (AOR = 5.206, 95% CI: 2.176–12.455, <e:math xmlns:e="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M3"><e:mi>p</e:mi><e:mo>&lt;</e:mo><e:mn>0.001</e:mn></e:math> ) were among factors that showed significant association with asymptomatic Plasmodium infection. Conclusion. The asymptomatic Plasmodium infection prevalence recorded in the study area was low. Last night’s LLIN usage, the presence of an eave, a house sprayed in the last year, and the presence of stagnant water near the home of the study participants were among the factors associated with an increased risk of catching the disease.

N2  - Full text Figures and data Side by side Abstract eLife digest Introduction Results Discussion Materials and methods References Decision letter Author response Article and author information Metrics Abstract Malaria transmission is spatially heterogeneous. This reduces the efficacy of control strategies, but focusing control strategies on clusters or 'hotspots' of transmission may be highly effective. Among 1500 homesteads in coastal Kenya we calculated (a) the fraction of febrile children with positive malaria smears per homestead, and (b) the mean age of children with malaria per homestead. These two measures were inversely correlated, indicating that children in homesteads at higher transmission acquire immunity more rapidly. This inverse correlation increased gradually with increasing spatial scale of analysis, and hotspots of febrile malaria were identified at every scale. We found hotspots within hotspots, down to the level of an individual homestead. Febrile malaria hotspots were temporally unstable, but 4 km radius hotspots could be targeted for 1 month following 1 month periods of surveillance. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02130.001 eLife digest Malaria remains a formidable threat to public health in tropical regions. The parasite that causes the disease is transmitted to humans by bites from infected mosquitoes, and the complicated lifecycle of the parasite makes developing vaccines difficult. However, preventive strategies are effective at reducing the spread of malaria. The two most widely used and effective strategies are the use of pesticide-treated bed nets to create a barrier between sleeping families and biting mosquitoes, and indoor residual spraying to reduce the numbers of mosquitoes biting sleeping families in homesteads. Other potential preventive strategies include killing mosquito larvae in breeding sites and mass anti-malarial drug treatment for infected humans. Targeting preventive efforts to malaria hotspots—the areas where the risk of malaria transmission is greatest—may help to eliminate malaria more efficiently. Unfortunately, identifying hotspots is complicated as there are many different factors that affect how malaria spreads. These factors range from ecological conditions such as rainfall and soil type, to human effects like population density and migration. Bejon et al. have examined the patterns of malaria transmission in Kenya over 9 years. Over this period, 54% of children who went to health clinics with a fever tested positive for the parasite that causes malaria. Infected children from areas with the highest rate of malaria infection were, on average, younger than those from less infected regions. This makes sense as in highly affected areas children have a greater chance of encountering the parasite at an early age. They are therefore more likely to get malaria when younger and, as exposure to the parasite can provide some immunity to a child, they are also less likely to get infected again when older. In addition, mapping the spread of malaria reveals hotspots at different geographical scales. Bejon et al. could see hotspots within hotspots, and in some cases could go as far as identifying the individual homesteads most at risk of malaria. Public health workers could potentially use these analyses to identify areas that are likely to be hotspots and then target preventive measures there for the next month. However, the constantly changing locations of the hotspots means workers would have to reanalyse the data and retarget their interventions at the end of each month. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02130.002 Introduction The transmission of infectious disease often shows substantial heterogeneity (Woolhouse et al., 1997). Malaria transmission is determined by mosquito ecology and behavior, which is in turn determined by rainfall, hydrology, soils, human behavior and population distributions, and a range of other social, biotic and abiotic factors. Heterogeneity of malaria transmission is apparent at global scale (Gething et al., 2011), regional scale (Kleinschmidt et al., 2001a; Noor et al., 2009), and at fine scale in, for instance, Mali (Gaudart et al., 2006), Ghana (Kreuels et al., 2008), Ethiopia (Yeshiwondim et al., 2009) Kenya (Brooker et al., 2004; Ernst et al., 2006; Bejon et al., 2010), and Tanzania (Bousema et al., 2010). This spatial heterogeneity makes transmission relatively resilient to indiscriminate control efforts, but also provides an opportunity to engage in targeted malaria control on clusters of transmission (or 'hotspots'), a strategy that is predicted to be highly effective (Dye and Hasibeder 1986; Woolhouse et al., 1997). We have previously identified hotspots of malaria using active surveillance (Bejon et al., 2010). Others have identified hotspots using passive surveillance in health facilities linked to demographic surveillance systems (Ernst et al., 2006). Passive surveillance is more readily scaled up, but may be biased by variations in access to health care facilities and socially-determined health-seeking behavior (Sumba et al., 2008; Franckel and Lalou 2009). The incidence of febrile malaria presenting to health care is thus biased by access to care. This bias may be countered by using the malaria positive fraction (MPF) among children with fever (also termed 'slide positivity rate' in some publications [Jensen et al., 2009]). The MPF includes all febrile children presenting to the dispensary as the denominator, hence controlling for access to health care, in contrast to incidence for which all children in the community are included in the denominator. The MPF is less likely to show systematic spatial bias with distance from the health facility since parental accounts of illness have not been found to discriminate malaria from non-malarial fever (Luxemburger et al., 1998; Mwangi et al., 2005), and diagnostic testing is not available outside the dispensary. We present data from demographic surveillance linked to passive case detection in Pingilikani dispensary in Kilifi District, coastal Kenya. Data are collected from 1500 homesteads within an 8 km radius followed for 9 years. We analyse the spatial heterogeneity of malaria cases in order to determine the temporal and spatial scales of case clustering so as to inform targeting in malaria control programmes. We also excluded visits with specific symptoms such as skin infections or cutaneous abscesses, otitis media, and gastroenteritis (>4 episodes diarrhoea per day) that might have been the primary motivation for seeking health care rather than fever per se. Results Among ∼20,000 remaining febrile presentations from ∼1500 different residences, 54% were positive for Plasmodium falciparum on blood smear examination. Using homestead as our unit of analysis, we found that the incidence of dispensary attendance declined with distance from the dispensary (on average −0.040 (95%CI 0.036–0.044) and −0.041 (95%CI 0.037–0.046) episodes per child year for each km for malaria smear positive and negative attendees, respectively). MPF was not found to vary significantly by distance of residence from the dispensary (from MPF = 0.50, 95%CI 0.47 to 0.54 at <2 km distance to MPF = 0.52, 95%CI 0.47 to 0.57 at 6–7 km, p=0.7). The spatio-temporal distribution of MPF by homestead is shown in Video 1 (slow speed) and Video 2 (fast speed). The visual impression from these clips suggests marked spatial variation, with some geographical areas showing persistently high MPFs, and other areas showing more marked temporal variation. Temporally stable spatial heterogeneity would be expected to lead to spatial heterogeneity in the acquisition of immunity, which may be evidenced by variation in the age profiles of children with febrile malaria. We therefore tested this hypothesis as below. Video 1 Download asset This video cannot be played in place because your browser does support HTML5 video.

The frames are identical to those in Video 1, but move more rapidly. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02130.004 Spatial heterogeneity in malaria risk and acquisition of immunity MPF was inversely correlated with the average age of children with malaria, Spearman's rank correlation (rs) = −0.16, p<0.0001 (Figure 1A–C). This suggests that greater exposure to malaria (i.e., high MPF) leads to more rapid acquisition of immunity as children grow up, hence predominantly younger children visiting the dispensary with febrile malaria. There was no evidence that this relationship was confounded by spatial clustering of age: the average age of children with non-malarial fever did not show spatial clustering (Moran's I = 0.01, p=0.5 within 1 km and Moran's I = 0.02, p=0.5 within 5 km) and was not associated with MPF (rs = −0.02, p=0.4). We examined the effect of spatial scale at which this correlation occurred by imposing grids of increasing cell size on the study area, calculating rs within each cell of the grid, and then estimating the mean rs at each scale of grid (Figure 1D, blue lines). The mean rs trended gradually away from 0 as the grid divisions became larger in scale. This pattern suggests gradual differentiation in transmission characteristics as the distance between homesteads included within a cell of the grid increases. We then examined the patterns seen on applying this analysis to simulated data. In order to exclude that this trend was a result of cells at fine-scale containing fewer homesteads, we ran permutations of the data using after randomly re-assigning spatial coordinates to the homesteads. These permutations show that a consistent correlation at rs = −0.16 throughout the range of grid sizes, albeit with greater uncertainty with smaller cell size (Figure 1D, red lines). Hence, the trend of a gradually increasing inverse correlation as the grid size increases does not appear to be explained simply by having fewer homesteads in each cell at fine scale. In order to determine the pattern that might be seen with specific spatial scales of clustering, we conducted further simulations by imposed patterns with specific scales on the spatial coordinates of the homesteads, in varying proportions with random noise using a gamma distribution. These simulations show that a specific scale of clustering produces 'spikes' in rs as the cell size varies, with the position of the spike coinciding with scale of the clustering (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Reducing the Signal:Noise ratio eventually obscured the 'spikes' due to a characteristic pattern, but only at the point where the overall correlation was no longer discernible (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Adding a gradient to the simulated characteristic scale attenuated but did not obscure the 'spikes' (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Figure 1 with 3 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Geographical distribution of malaria positive fraction and average age of febrile malaria. Each plotted point represents an individual homestead, where the colour shading indicates the malaria positive fraction (MPF) in panel A, or the average age of children who test positive for malaria in panel B. Panel C shows the scatter plot for MPF vs average age (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs) = −0.16, p<0.0001). Panel D shows rs (y axis) plotted against scale of analysis (x axis), where a grid with varying cell size is imposed on the study area, rs is calculated within each cell and then the mean rs presented, with 95% confidence intervals produced by boot-strap (blue solid and dashed lines, respectively), and the results of analysis of spatially-random permutations of the data with equivalent cell size are shown for comparison (red solid and dashed lines, respectively). The analysis shown in panel D was compared on simulations with varying simulated characteristic scales, Signal:Noise ratios and with added gradients (Figure 1—figure supplements 1–3, respectively). https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02130.005 Hotspots within hotspots Using the Bernoulli model in SaTScan (Kulldorff, 1997), we identified a hotspot with a radius of 5.8 km at p<0.00001 (Figure 2A) using the full data set (for which n = 20,702). However, on re-analysis of the children within this hotspot (in which n = 5300), we identified a further hotspot (with a radius of 0.76 km) within the 5.8 km hotspot (p<0.00001, Figure 2B). Then on further re-analysis of the homesteads within that 0.76 km hotspot (within which n = 1406), we identified a third significant hotspot (p=0.016) which comprised a single homestead, in which there were 36 episodes of malaria compared with 3 malaria negative fevers (Figure 2D). When we selected a random 5-km square area outside the original 5.8 km radius hotspot, we identified a hotspot within this area a fourth hotspot with a 1.32 km radius (p<0.00001, Figure 2C). Figure 2 with 2 supplements see all Download asset Open asset Hotspots within hotspots. Each plotted point represents an individual homestead, where the colour shading indicates the malaria positive fraction (MPF). Hotspots are identified using SATScan, using the whole study area (panel A), then repeated within the hotspot (panel B), within the hotspot of panel B (panel D), and then within a randomly chosen area outside the hotspot (panel C). The semi-variogram and log–log semi-variogram plot are shown in Figure 2—figure supplements 1 and 2, respectively. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02130.009 To further explore the scale of spatial clustering, we plotted the semivariogram (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) and the log–log transformed semivariogram (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). These plots suggested linear fits for the semivariogram, suggesting that spatial clustering occurred over a range of spatial scales. Temporal trends of spatial heterogeneity We also examined temporal trends for individual homesteads (Figure 3). There was an inverse correlation between the mean MPF and the variance in MPF over the 10-year study period (rs = −0.61, p<0.0001, Figure 3A). The temporal trends for two subsets of homestead can be seen in Figure 3B (stable high MPF) and Figure 3C (unstable low MPF), suggesting that homesteads can be characterized as stable high transmission homesteads or unstable low transmission homesteads. Infant parasite rates have been proposed as a measure of transmission intensity that minimizes the offsetting of acquired immunity in macro-epidemiological studies (Snow et al., 1996). We therefore hypothesized that the malaria positive fractions in children <1 year of age (hereafter 'MPF<1yr') would measure transmission intensity without the offsetting of acquired immunity, and that unstable transmission would result in higher risk of malaria in older children. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the mean MPF<1yr and the variance in MPF<1yr for each homestead over the 9 years of follow up and tested the relationships between these metrics and risk of malaria in older children in multivariable linear regression models. Figure 3 Download asset Open asset Temporal variations in malaria positive fraction. (Panel A) shows the scatter plot of individual homesteads by mean malaria positive fraction (MPF) on the x axis vs variance in MPF on the y axis (rs = −0.61, p<0.0001). A labelled blue circle indicates subset q (homesteads with high variance but low mean MPF) and subset p (homesteads with low variance and high mean MPF). The temporal trends for these two subsets are shown on panels (B and C), respectively. The median trend for the study area is shown in red. (Panel D) shows the regression coefficients (y axis) for the malaria positive fractions (MPF) in older children when regressed on; (i) the mean MPF in children <1 year of age (MPF<1y) and (ii) MPF in older children when regressed on the variance in MPF<1y over the 9 years of the study. Separate multivariable regression models (i.e., with mean MPF<1y and variance in MPF<1y as explanatory variables) are fit for each age group as shown on the x axis (excluding children <1 year of age, whose data are used to calculate MPF<1y). https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02130.012 In multivariable linear regression models, MPF<1yr was strongly correlated with MPFs in children in the 1- to 2-year-old and 2- to 3-year-old age group, but progressively less strongly correlated with MPF in older children (Figure 3Di). The regression coefficient was ∼0.4 for 1–2 year olds, meaning that each unit increase in MPF<1yr is associated with a 0.4 increase in the MPF for 1- to 2-year-old children. On the other hand, the variance in MPF<1yr was not correlated with MPFs in 1- to 2- or 2- to 3-year-old children, but was progressively more strongly correlated with MPF in older children (Figure 3Dii). Hence there were high stable transmission homesteads, with predominantly younger children getting febrile malaria, and low unstable transmission homesteads, with increasing risk to older children. This pattern of high stable vs low unstable transmission also occurs between regions or countries, and demonstrates a similarity between the micro- and macro-epidemiology of malaria (Hay et al., 2008). Theoretical accuracy of targeted control undertaken at varying temporal and spatial scales We then used our data set to simulate the accuracy of targeting cases that a malaria control programme might achieve on conducting surveillance over a defined period of time followed by targeted control. We assumed that malaria control programmes would need to define a priori the period of time to use for surveillance, and also to select a spatial scale at which to define hotspots. For varying time periods and spatial scales, we determined the % of excess malaria cases within the targeted hotspots compared with the surrounding area in the period of time immediately following the simulated surveillance. One week periods of surveillance (top left panel of Figure 4) did not identify hotspots that are still present the following week at fine spatial scales (i.e., the plotted line indicates that the accuracy of targeting is 0% at scales of less than 1 km). On the other hand, at larger spatial scales we found that 1 week periods of surveillance were more accurate, resulting in the targeting of areas with a 60% excess of new malaria cases compared with the surrounding area at a scale of an 8 km diameter. A similar pattern was seen for monthly periods of surveillance. Longer surveillance periods (e.g., 6 months) resulted in targeting areas with an excess of 20% malaria cases compared with the surrounding area over the range of spatial scales examined. Figure 4 Download asset Open asset Theoretical accuracy of targeted control undertaken at varying temporal and spatial scales. The accuracy of varying strategies of hotspot identification is shown. Each panel is labelled with the time period of surveillance data used. The x axis shows the diameter of hotspot defined. In each case hotspots were selected to account for 20% of the homesteads in the area. The y axis shows the increase that would have been present assuming that they were targeted in the time period following their identification. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02130.013 ITN use and spatial variation in risk Mass distributions of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) in the area began in 2006. ITN use was surveyed in 2009 and 2010. We found that children using ITNs had a reduced risk of malaria by logistic regression (i.e., OR = 0.69, 95%CI 0.67 to 0.8, p<0.001), in keeping with previous literature on the personal protection provided by ITN use (Lim et al., 2011). On the other hand, we did not identify significant evidence that ITN use was clustered spatially (Moran's I = 0.02, p=0.5). Furthermore, adding ITN use as a covariate in SaTScan analysis to locate hotspots had little effect on results; the addition of ITN use as a covariate changed the location of the hotspot by 120 m, and changed the predicted radius of the hotspot from 5.4 km to 5.2 km. On re-analysis of the homesteads within the 5.4 km hotspot, a further 0.87 km hotspot was identified the position and radius of which were not altered by the inclusion of ITN use as a covariate. Finally, within this 0.87 km hotspot the same 7 homesteads were identified as a hotspot irrespective of the inclusion of ITN use as a covariate. We did not identify significant evidence that ITN use correlated mean MPF<1yr (rs = −0.04, p=0.04) or with the variance in MPF<1yr (rs = −0.01, p=0.7). Hence, ITNs provided personal protection from malaria, but we were unable to show that they explained the spatial micro-epidemiological patterns. Discussion We found that malaria cases were spatially heterogeneous in an 8-km radius area of coastal Kenya. The strongly significant inverse correlation between the malaria positive fraction (MPF) and average age of children presenting with malaria suggests variable acquisition of immunity between homesteads. Homesteads at high transmission intensity have a high MPF and a young average age of malaria (with older children becoming immune and therefore not presenting to the dispensary) whereas homesteads at low transmission intensity have a low MPF but an older average age of malaria since older children are not becoming immune as rapidly. In theory, this inverse correlation might have arisen because of heterogeneity at various spatial scales. For instance, there might have been a block of homesteads all at high transmission in one half of the study area (thus with high MPF and low average age) and a second block of homesteads at low transmission in the other half (with low MPF and high average age). On the other hand, the inverse correlation might have arisen because of a random distribution of 'high' and 'low' transmission intensity homesteads throughout the study area. To determine at which spatial scale transmission was heterogeneous, we conducted an analysis where correlation coefficient was recalculated within each cell of a grid superimposed on the study area. The mean correlation coefficient of all cells was then presented as the cell size of the grid used was increased (Figure 1D). This analysis was done to identify the most influential geographical scale at which the inverse correlation was observed. In simulated data, we noted 'spikes' where the inverse correlation was abruptly lost when the size of cells in the grid coincides with the size of the geographical 'blocks' of homesteads that drove the inverse correlation, as seen in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Similar spikes were seen after adding simulated noise and gradients in space over which the correlation varied (Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2 and 3). Real-world data would contain more complex sources of variation than we have simulated, and hence may not produce distinct spikes. Nevertheless, the analysis of these simulations suggests that discontinuities in the correlation between MPF and average age of malaria over cell size might be expected when clustering is at a specific spatial scale. In fact there was no such discontinuity in the function shown in Figure 1D, indicating that the inverse correlation was present at every geographical scale examined within our study. It is likely that this pattern would extend at greater geographical scales, since a similar inverse correlation between the age distributions of malaria cases and transmission intensity can be seen on comparing countries and regions (Okiro et al., 2009). The pattern of spatial heterogeneity is relevant to malaria control, since targeted disease control is predicted to be highly effective (Woolhouse et al., 1997). Spatial targeting is particularly appropriate for malaria 'hotspots' (Coleman et al., 2009; Moonen et al., 2010; Bousema et al., 2012; Sturrock et al., 2013) and many malaria control programmes are already engaged in spatially-targeted intervention (Zhou et al., 2010; Loha et al., 2012). Our data showing clustering at varying spatial scales suggest that malaria control programs can expect to identify hotspots at many different geographical scales. We demonstrate that hotspots occur within hotspots, down to the level of a single homestead, and also that hotspots can be identified on 'zooming in' on random areas outside the main hotspot (Figure 2C). These hotspots were based on analysis of a large dataset with adequate power, and were strongly significant based on the multiple permutations run in SaTScan, suggesting that type I statistical error is an unlikely explanation for our findings. The complexity of presenting 'hotspots within hotspots' to a malaria control programme is further compounded by the temporal instability of the spatial pattern (Figure 3). We therefore simulated the accuracy with which hotspots could be targeted using varying spatial scales and varying time periods of surveillance. We found that using data aggregated over 1 month of surveillance to define 4 to 8 km diameter hotspots would provide greatest accuracy, but this information is only relevant for 1 month before temporal instability necessitates further surveillance. One might therefore consider a continuous programme of parallel surveillance and targeting, where the surveillance data are examined at the end of each month to determine the location to be targeted for the following month. Continuous surveillance would allow adaptive targeting of hotspots for the following month. Such a strategy might be employed all year round, or for a limited period of the year depending on local seasonality. (Cairns et al., 2012) Targeting at this spatial scale has the added practical advantage that it could be done with village-level location data and would not require fine-scale geo-positional data. There are some caveats to this recommendation. Our observations are from a single site. Other sites should examine their local data to determine whether a similar targeting strategy is appropriate. Furthermore, some hotspots did show temporal stability. For instance, we identified a 6 km diameter hotspot south east of the dispensary that maintained a 30–60% increase in MPF compared with the surrounding area throughout the 9-year surveillance. Children with positive microscopy slides for malaria presenting at the dispensary may have genuine febrile malaria, or alternatively may have chronic asymptomatic parasitaemia with co-incident non-malarial fever. Previous studies estimating malaria attributable fractions in the locality suggest 61% of the children in our analysis would have malaria as the proximate cause of their illness, with the other 39% having chronic asymptomatic parasitaemia with co-incident fever from another cause (Olotu et al., 2011). We have previously demonstrated that spatial heterogeneity is more temporally stable when analysed for asymptomatic parasitaemia rather than febrile malaria (Bejon et al., 2010). Targeting hotspots of asymptomatic parasitaemia would require community surveys rather than dispensary monitoring, which may need to be done less frequently than monitoring of febrile malaria episodes. Furthermore MPF is not a comprehensive indicator of transmission intensity. Homesteads with consistently low average ages of febrile malaria are likely to be stable high transmission homesteads (such as those in subset p of Figure 3A) which amplify transmission in the areas surrounding them. Targeting such high transmission homesteads to interrupt transmission may be highly effective (Woolhouse et al., 1997). The stronger inverse correlation between MPF and average age of febrile malaria as spatial scale increases (Figure 1) suggests that the spatial heterogeneity of transmission is progressively more stable at more coarse spatial scales. Malaria transmission is determined by mosquito ecology and behavior. Mosquito ecology may be determined by obvious geographical features such as altitude (Reyburn et al., 2005), cultivation practices (Lindsay et al., 1991), streams and dams (Ghebreyesus et al., 1999), wind direction (Midega et al., 2012) and mosquito searching behaviour for hosts (Smith et al., 2004). Ecological models based on such features have been developed using frequentist techniques (Omumbo et al., 2005), Bayesian approaches (Craig et al., 2007), and fuzzy logic (Snow et al., 1998). However, the same ecological factor may act inconsistently in different geographical areas (Kleinschmidt et al., 2001b; Gemperli et al., 2006; Noor et al., 2008), and the effect of ecological factors is modified by fine-scale vector and host movement (Perkins et al., 2013). Our data suggests that the environmental factors determining malaria transmission operate at a range of spatial scales. We might speculate that mosquit

N2  - The common bed bug species Cimex lectularius, which has a worldwide distribution, and C. hemipterus, which has tropical climate distribution, are hematophagous arthropods.1 The bugs are attracted to the human host by warmth and carbon dioxide, and bed bug infestations are rapidly increasing worldwide. Moreover, bed bugs are likely to be more problematic in the future because of travel, immigration, and insecticide resistance. Reactions to bites vary, and some patients present only asymptomatic macules, whereas others develop indurated, bulbous lesions that resemble erythema multiforme.2 Although no case of bed bug-borne infection has been reported yet, bed bug infestations can have an adverse effect on health and quality of life in the general population, particularly among homeless persons living in shelters.1,3 The transmission of more than 45 human diseases has been attributed to bed bugs; however, there is little evidence that they are vectors of communicable disease.1 The objective of this study was to analyze with molecular assays a large number of bed bugs from Rwanda, where epidemiological and clinical studies on zoonosis are scarce.  Bed bugs were collected from two prisons in Rwanda (Miyove and Muhanga prisons) (Figure 1) from May to January of 2011 and taken to a local laboratory. Bed bugs were preserved in sterile conditions at room temperature and then sent to our reference center in Marseille to test for lice-borne infections. Before DNA isolation, each bug was rinsed two times in sterile water for 15 minutes. Overall, 100 bed bugs were tested. DNA was extracted from each bug using a QIAamp tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and then used as template in a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay targeting a portion of the Bartonella 16S–23S intergenic spacer region (ITS) as described previously.4 Two specific B. quintana genes (fabF3 and yopP) encode for 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase and a hypothetical intracellular effector, respectively.5 All three sets were positive by real-time PCR for one bed bug. Amplicons were then purified using the QIAquick Spin PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) and sequenced on an ABI 3100 Automated Sequencer (Perking Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France) using the dRhodamine Terminator Cycle-Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Les Ulis, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequences obtained after sequencing of the ITS gene shared 100% similarity to the corresponding ITS fragment of the genome of B. quintana (Toulouse strain; GenBank accession number {type:entrez-nucleotide,attrs:{text:BX897700,term_id:49239191,term_text:BX897700}}BX897700). B. quintana-positive bugs were further studied by PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of the mitochondrial (16S DNA) gene as previous described.6 Sequences obtained shared 99.7% similarity to the corresponding 16S DNA fragment of the genome of C. hemipterus (GenBank accession number {type:entrez-nucleotide,attrs:{text:GU985560.1,term_id:294999274,term_text:GU985560.1}}GU985560.1). Moreover, B. quintana-positive bugs were triturated in brain–heart medium before inoculation onto Columbia 5% sheep blood agar plates (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Plates were placed in polyethylene bags and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 (Genbag CO2 system; BioMerieux). The agar plates were examined weekly. After 1 month, no evidence of growth was observed.    Figure 1.  The two areas in Rwanda where the bed bugs were collected.    In this study, we identified the presence of B. quintana in C. hemipterus collected from a prison in Rwanda. B. quintana and Rickettsia prowazekii have been previous identified in body lice collected from a similar jail in Rwanda,7 and recently, B. quintana was found in head and body lice in Ethiopia.8 To avoid the potential of misinterpretation of the PCR data caused by laboratory contamination, three different genes were assessed, and all of them were successfully detected. However, we were not able to cultivate B. quintana from this bug. This result suggests that living microorganisms may be dead before testing or that only DNA but no living organisms were present in the bug. C. hemipterus might be contaminated when they feed on the blood of prisoners infected with B. quintana. Unfortunately, a human blood sample was not collected at the time of sampling the bugs. There are few data to support bed bugs as vectors for transmission of human disease agents, and older studies consist of only logical and not evidence-based postulates.9 Recently, Delaunay and others1 found no published evidence for completion of all the necessary steps leading to the conclusion that bed bugs transmit a pathogen. It is possible that the bed bug might only play the role of vector in pathogen transmission, and consequently, it may be involved in human disease in special circumstances not yet discovered.1 Nonetheless, the role of the bed bugs in the maintenance and transmission of B. quintana remains to be determined, and it is currently being tested in our laboratory.

N2  - Background: Insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs) have raised a renewed interest to serve as tools for malaria control in Africa.The use of this control method has been proved to be a cost-effective means for the control of malaria.However, little is known the acceptability and utilization of mosquito nets in Ethiopia. Objectives:The objective of this study is to provide relevant information about the knowledge, attitude and experience of communities about malaria and its preventive methods, particularly the acceptability and affordability of ITNs.Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in five different parts of Ethiopia in January and February 1999.A multi-stage sampling method was used to select 1,933 households for the study.Data were collected by interviewing household heads or their representatives.Results: Ninety-five percent of the participants perceived fever, headache and chilling of the body as the main symptoms of malaria.More than 87% of the interviewees correctly identified the names of the anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine and SP.About 93% of the participants knew that malaria could be transmitted through mosquito bites.Mosquitoes are known to breed on stagnant water (83%).More than 43% of the respondents replied that DDT, in combination with other control measures, could prevent malaria.Forty-one percent of the respondents had heard about the mosquito net.Only 5.3% of the respondents in the survey reported the presence of at least one mosquito net in their households.Most of the respondents (92.5%) were interested in using mosquito nets sometime in the future.The most preferred mode of obtaining ITNs was on loan basis (60%).Accordingly, 24%, 20% and 16% were willing to pay in three, six, and nine months of installments and above, respectively.Forty-percent of the study participants were ready to buy it in cash.Of the 1,696 respondents, 47% suggested 10 Birr or less, 11% between 11 and 20 Birr, 28% from 21-50 Birr and the rest (14%) mentioned 51 Birr and above as the appropriate price for purchasing a single ITN. Conclusion:The utilization of mosquito nets at the time of the study was very low.However, acceptability and willingness to use ITNs for malaria prevention was very high.Thus, the expanding ITN implementation and increasing its coverage for malaria control both in urban and rural malarious areas of the country is crucial.It is recommended that communities should be strongly sensitized on the importance of ITNs for malaria control and the availability and affordability should be insured.[

N2  - The aim of this investigation was to identify honeybee flora species, identify the constraints and opportunities of honey production in three purposively selected districts of North Wollo, Amhara, Ethiopia from September to November 2021. In total, 384 beekeepers were purposively selected for the interview based on accessibility and beekeeping potentials. Structured and semi-structured questionnaires, key informant interview and focal group discussions were used for data collection. Beekeepers indicated that the major source of bee colony was buying, catching swarm and gift from others with decreasing order. Beekeepers kept their bee colony in the backyard area. They keep traditional, movable frame and top bar hive, respectively, in descending order. Majority of the beekeepers follow traditional production systems. Twenty-nine honeybee flora species and twelve poisonous plants are also identified. Use of agrochemicals, lack of beekeeping equipment, diseases, pests and predators were the main challenges to beekeeping identified in the study area. Conversely, the suitability of an environment with different agro-ecology, the availability of diversified honeybee flora and the attractive price of honey are the best-observed opportunities to increase honey production and productivity. In conclusion, great attention should be given to training and extension programs for beekeepers focusing on honeybee management, pest and predator prevention, and/or control methods. Supporting beekeeping equipments, strict rules and regulations on the use of agrochemicals should be necessary. Further research should be done on the abundance of honey bee flora and the level and effect of poisonous honeybee floras in order to increase the productivity and income of beekeepers.

N2  - Beekeeping is a long-standing practice in the rural communities of Ethiopia and appears as ancient history of the country. A cross sectional study, in which 97 households were purposively included, was conducted in Haramaya district to assess the current beekeeping practices, production potentials and production constraints. Most (99%) of the beekeepers in the study area have owned only traditional hives and produce honey for home consumption. The beekeeping practice was dominated by male. A mild stimulant, Kate edulis (khat), is the main income source for the residents. Lack of adequate bee forages, poor market, lack of trained development agents and bee pests are the major problems facing the beekeeping sub sector in the area. The most important constraints of beekeeping in the study area were insecticides, birds and bee diseases (1st), Misuse of pesticides (2nd), Insecticides, birds and pesticides together (3rd), Pests, insecticides and predators (4th), lack of training (5th), shortage of bee forage (6th), shortage of water (7th) and absconding (8th). There are enormous opportunities to boost the production of honey in the villages. Thus, introducing modern beehives, limiting the use of pesticides in 'khat' production and awareness creation and assistance to empower women in the beekeeping activity are needed interventions.

N2  - The use of botanical insecticides can serve as an alternative to the environmentally undesirable inorganic insecticides as a means of malaria vector control. The objective of the study was to identify the biologically active compounds of Oreosyce africana (Cucurbitaceae) leaf extracts by using a bioassay-guided approach on adult mosquitoes. The dichloromethane fraction of O. africana crude methanol extract was subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation by flash column chromatography, preparative thin-layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography to obtain purified fractions. The purified fractions were assayed against adult Anopheles arabiensis Patton. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used for identification of the active chemical compounds against adult mosquitoes. The LC50 and LC90 values were determined based on probit analysis. Two purified fractions of O. africana, fraction IV or B2’O and B2’’O, had the most potent adulticidal activities with an LC50 of 2.206 and LC90 of 7.811 ppm and with an LC50 of 2.62 and LC90 of 11.779 ppm at 24 hrs post-exposure, respectively. Among the purified fractions of O. africana LC50 ratio of B2’O and B2’’O showed significantly different values at P<0.05. The structural elucidation of the active ingredients using GC-MS analysis showed the presence of 9,12-Octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z) as the major chemical constituent (98.35%) in B2’O fraction and dibutyl phthalate as the major chemical constituent (97.75%) in B2’’O fraction with their molecular peaks at m/z 280 and 278, respectively. These results suggest that the purified fractions of O. africana possess a very high adulticidal effect against the principal malaria vector, An. arabiensis, in Ethiopia and have a potential for development into an affordable botanical mosquitocide as an alternative to the existing inorganic insecticides with environmental toxicity.

N2  - Globally, vegetable production including tomato is constrained by pests and diseases. The tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick.), is a major pest of tomato, mainly managed using chemical pesticides. There is a need for integrated pest management (IPM), approaches that are human and environmentally friendly. The study aimed at molecular identification and virulence evaluation of four entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) against T. absoluta larvae. The DNA was extracted, sequenced, and phylogeny analyzed. The EPNs virulence was evaluated using the insect baiting technique at different nematode concentrations (0-Control, 100, 150, 200, and 250 infective juveniles/ml of distilled water). Larval mortality data were collected for five days. Molecular identification resulted in nucleotide sequence lengths of 877-895 base pairs (bp). All the isolates were found to be Steinernema species of EPNs. The % similarity of the isolates and their close relatives ranged between 82-100%. The isolates closely matched Steinernema spp. AY230184 (Sri Lanka); AY230186 (Kenya), JN651414 (Ethiopia), and MW151701 (Kenya). The sequences were deposited to Genbank as Steinernema sp. Isolate Kalro 75 (MW150871), Steinernema sp. Isolate Kalro S86 (MW150872), Steinernema sp. isolate Kalro97 (MW150873) and Steinernema sp. Isolate KalroR52 (MW150874). All the EPN isolates were virulent against T. absoluta. Isolate Kalro R52 and Kalro S86 recorded the highest mortality of 76&amp;plusmn;7.5%; 72&amp;plusmn;15.0% respectively in the 48 h. There was a significant difference (P &amp;lt; 0.001), between all the isolates and the Control. The four EPNs were virulent and have bio-control potential against, T. absoluta. Research on their virulence against T. absoluta in the field is recommended.

N2  - The efficacy of synthetic inorganic insecticides to control malaria vector mosquitoes is compromised by increased mosquito resistance to insecticides.Furthermore, use of inorganic insecticides raises serious environmental toxicity concerns.The test plants, Oreosyce africana and Piper capense were identified in Ethiopia through ethnobotanical leads obtained on the basis formal and informal field interviews and discussions coupled with literature search for sister species tested elsewhere.The plant powder from these species was extracted using 80% methanol and the methanol crude extracts of Oreosyce africana and Piper capense were sequentially fractionated with solvents (dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and deionized water).Each fraction was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and deionized water; test concentration prepared and tested for their bioactivity against Anopheles arabiensis adults.The dichloromethane fraction of Oreosyce africana and ethyl acetate fraction of Piper capense had higher adulticidal activities with LC 50 and LC 90 values of 4.27 and 14.12 ppm and 10.72 and 30.59 ppm, respectively.Comparison of dichloromethane fraction of Oreosyce africana with ethyl acetate and water fractions showed significant differences at p<0.05.And comparison of ethyl acetate fraction of Piper capense with dichloromethane and water fractions showed significant differences at p<0.05.Thus, the bioassays with dichloromethane fraction of Oreosyce africana and ethyl acetate fraction of Piper capense exhibited higher adulticidal effect against Anopheles arabiensis than other solvent fractions.Dichloromethane fraction of Oreosyce africana and ethyl acetate fraction of Piper capense were examined under HPLC and UV-Vis for the proximate analysis.These plant products would be ideal alternatives for the control of malaria vector mosquitoes upon fractionation and preparation of suitable delivery packages.

N2  - Lake Ziway, a freshwater lake located in Ethiopia, is under the pressure of pesticide and nutrient pollution due to agricultural activity and urbanization. This study has analysed concentrations of insecticides, fungicides and nutrients in water and sediment samples of Lake Ziway taken in the wet and dry season at 13 sites expected to be under different environmental stress and assessed their expected ecological impacts. Malathion, dimethoate, metalaxyl, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion and endosulfan were detected in more than half of the water samples, while diazinon, α-cypermethrin and endosulfan were frequently detected (>25%) in sediment samples. Higher levels of physicochemical parameters were observed at sample locations proximate to agricultural and urban activities. Risk quotients (RQ) and multi-substance Potentially Affected Fraction (msPAFRA) were calculated to assess the ecological risk of individual and mixture of pesticides, respectively. The majority of the pesticides detected in the water of the lake showed a potential acute risk (RQ > 1), specifically the insecticides chlorpyrifos, λ-cyhalothrin and α-cypermethrin for which high potential acute risks were calculated using a 2nd tier risk assessment. Levels of pesticides in sediment showed low ecological risks. Arthropods and fishes are expected to be highly affected by mixtures of pesticides (msPAFRA = < 1–80%) detected at locations that are proximate to smallholders' farms, and receive largescale farms' wastewater and at sites where inflow rivers join the lake. Macroinvertebrates based redundancy analysis showed the effectiveness of EPT richness to assess ecological status of the lake. Training for smallholder farmers on pesticides safety and usage, and implementation of improved effluent management mechanisms by floriculture farms are urgently needed intervention measures to reduce the pollution.

N2  - ____________________________________________________________ Biological control studies were conducted with isolates of entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarrhizium anisopliae from Ethiopia and South Africa against the spotted stem borer Chilo partellus. The study was conducted from April 2002 to April 2003, at the department of Entomology and Nematology, University of Stellenbosch, South Africa. The objectives were to screen these isolates for pathogenicity and to determine the susceptibility of different larval instars; to study the effect of temperature on fungal development and virulence; to investigate food consumption of fungus treated larvae; to determine compatibility of fungal isolates with insecticides; to study the effect of exposure methods and diets on larval mortality; and to evaluate promising isolates under greenhouse conditions using artificially infested maize plants. Four isolates of B. bassiana and six isolates of M. anisopliae were tested against second instar larvae. Of these isolates, B. bassiana (BB-01) and M. anisopliae (PPRC-4, PPRC-19, PPRC-61 and EE-01) were found to be highly pathogenic inducing 90 to 100 % mortality seven days after treatment. In subsequent assays, the fungal isolates were tested against third, fourth, fifth and sixth instar larvae. Second and sixth instar larvae were more susceptible to these isolates than third, fourth and fifth instar larvae. Conidial germination, radial growth and sporulation of the isolates PPRC-4, PPRC-19, PPRC-61, EE-01 and BB-01 were retarded at 15 and 35 C. A suitable temperature range for the isolates was from 20 30 C. At 25 and 30 C the isolates induced 100 % mortality to second instar larvae within four to six days. Second and third instar C. partellus larvae were treated with the isolates PPRC-4 and BB-01, and daily consumption of maize leaf was measured. Treatment with the fungi was associated with a reduction in mean daily food consumption. In in-vitro studies, five concentrations (0.1 ppm, 1 ppm, 5 ppm, 10 ppm, and 100 ppm active ingredients) of the insecticides benfuracarb and endosulfan were tested with the isolates PPRC-4, PPRC-19, PPRC-16, EE-01 and BB-01. Increasing the concentration of the insecticides adversely affected germination, radial growth and sporulation of the isolates. In in-vivo studies combining the fungi, PPRC-4 and BB-01,

N2  - Abstract Background : In Ethiopia, malaria is highly seasonal with varying intensities of transmission due to altitudinal and climatic variations. Information on bionomics of principal, secondary and suspected malaria vectors, species composition, seasonal dynamics and/or abundance and insecticide susceptibility status at locality level is important to understand malaria transmission in a particular eco- epidemiological setting to design effective vector control strategies. Methods : Mosquitoes were collected using CDC light traps and human landing catches (HLC) for 17 months between June 2018 and September 2020 from Lare district of Gambella Regional State, Ethiopia. The Anopheles mosquitoes were morphologically identified and preserved for further analysis. Larvae and pupae of Anopheline mosquitoes were collected from breeding sites of Lare district and Jimma zone and reared to adult. Bioassays were conducted on non-blood-fed, 3-5-day-old adult female mosquitoes emerged from larvae and pupae using discriminating concentrations of WHO insecticide-impregnated papers. Deltamethrin-survived samples of An. coustani were molecularly identified via Sanger sequencing (COI and COII mitochondrial gene determination). Plasmodium parasite infection in An . pharoensis and An. coustani was investigated using TaqMan qPCR assay. Mean monthly density differences among mosquito species were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Differences in mean Anopheles mosquito density between outdoor and indoor catches by HLC were compared using a t test. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics for Windows v.20.0. Results : Of 11,048 Anopheles mosquitoes collected during the 17-months survey, An. coustani was the most abundant species, representing 46.20% (5103/11048), followed by An. phraoensis (27.89%, n= 3082), An. gambiae complex (16.04%, n= 1772) and An. funestus (9.88%, n= 1091). About 73.17% (n=8084) the mosquitoes were collected using CDC and while 26.83% (n=2964) were captured using HLC method The mean monthly density of female Anopheles collected by HLC was 5.17 mosquitoes per-person-night, while the corresponding mean monthly mosquito density by CDC LT was 17.37 mosquitoes per trap-night. The number of Anopheles mosquitoes captured outdoors by HLC was 1.36 times higher than the indoor capture. There was positive but weak (p &gt; 0.05) association between Anopheles abundance and mean monthly rainfall in the Lare district. An. pharoensis , An. gambiae s.l. and An. coustani complex were susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl (organophosphate), propoxur and bendiocarb (carbamate). However, An. pharoensis and An. gambiae s.l. were resistant to DDT, deltamethrin, permethrin and malathion. On the other hand, An. coustani complex were resistant to DDT and deltamethrin (pyrethroid). Species identification of deltamethrin survivor An. coustani (morphological) was also molecularly confirmed. No Plasmodium infection was detected in An. coustani and An. pharoensis . Conclusion : Temporal variation in mean density of Anopheles mosquito species was recorded in relatively large number (except An. funestus ) during June-November. The higher mean mosquito density from outdoors coupled with multiple insecticide resistance of malaria vector populations and occurrence of An. funestus in dry season call for regular monitoring and intervention considering the behavioral dynamics of Anopheles species across seasons. Additional information on mosquito fauna and abundance in relation to metrological factors in a particular locality is essential for the development of efficient vector control interventions.

N2  - Abstract Background In Ethiopia, malaria is highly seasonal with varying intensity of transmission due to altitudinal and climatic variations. Information on principal, secondary and suspected malaria vector species composition, their seasonal dynamics and/or abundance, bionomics and insecticide susceptibility status at locality levels are important to understand malaria transmission in a particular eco-epidemiological setting in order to design effective vector control strategy. Methods Adult female Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from Lare district of Gambella Regional State and Jimma Zone of Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Mosquitoes were collected using CDC light traps and human landing catches (HLC) for 17 months between June 2017 to October 2020. All the collected Anopheles mosquitoes were morphologically identified and properly preserved for further analysis. Larvae and pupae of Anopheles gambiae complex, An. pharoensis and An. coustani were collected from breeding sites and reared to adult under field condition in the field insectary. Bioassays were conducted on non-blood-fed, 3–5 days old adult female mosquitoes emerged from larvae and pupae using discriminating concentrations of WHO insecticide impregnated papers. Randomly selected sub-sample of the morphologically identified An. coustani was molecularly identified via Sanger sequencing (COI and COII mitochondrial gene determination). TaqMan qPCR assay was employed to investigate Plasmodium parasite infection in An . pharoensis and An. coustani . Differences in mean Anopheles mosquito density between outdoor and indoor catches by HLC were compared using t-test. Mean difference among trapping methods and mosquito density were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s Post-hoc test. Pearson correlation was used to assess the association between the overall Anopheles mosquito density from Lare district with climatic factors such as rain fall and temperature. Duncan post-hoc test was employed to compare mean mortality rate of mosquitoes exposed to different insecticides. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics for windows v.20.0 and values were considered significant at p &lt; 0.05. Results A total of 11,876 Anopheles mosquitoes belonging to four species were collected using CDC and HLC methods during the study period. An. coustani was by far the most abundant species representing 47.84% (5681/11876) of the total collections and 96.2% of it was sampled using CDC traps. Other Anopheles mosquitoes collected were An. phraoensis (26.90%, n = 3195), An. gambiae complex (16.07%, n = 1909) and An. funestus (9.19%, n = 1091). While all the four Anopheles species were identified from Lare district, An. funestus was not recorded from Jimma zone study sites. The majority (74.22%, n = 8814) of Anopheles were collected using CDC light traps (73 trap nights) while the remaining (25.78%, n = 3062) were captured by HLC (288 person-nights). The mean monthly density of female Anopheles collected by HLC was 5.17 (95% CI 0.67–9.66) mosquitoes per-person-night while the corresponding mean monthly mosquito density by CDC LT was 17.37 mosquitoes (95% CI 3.15–31.59) per trap-night. Of all collected Anopheles mosquitoes by HLC, the number of Anopheles mosquitoes captured outdoor was higher by 1.36 times than the corresponding indoor capture. There was no direct association between Anopheles abundance and rain fall and or mean monthly maximum and minimum temperatures in Lare district. Anopheles pharoensis , An. gambiae s.l and An. coustani complex were susceptible to Primiphose methyl (organophosphate) and Propoxur and bendiocarb (carbamate). However, Anopheles pharoensis and An. gambiae s.l were resistant to DDT, deltamethrin, permethrin and malathion. On the other hand, An. coustani complex were resistant to only DDT. Sub-samples of morphologically identified as An. coustani were molecularly confirmed to belong to the An. coustani . No Plasmodium infection was detected in An. coustani and An. pharoensis . Conclusion Anopheles coustani was the most abundant species in this study. High vector density was recorded following rainy seasons. Relatively higher density of the principal vector, An. gambiae s.l . was captured using CDC during October-November 2017, June 2017 and September 2018 following the heavy rainy months (June-August) and/or beginning of the long rains (June). There was higher mean mosquito density outdoor than indoor using HLC. Multiple insecticides resistance was observed in both the principal and secondary malaria vector populations in both Lare and Jimma Zone study sites of Ethiopia. Sub-samples of all the morphologically identified Anopheles coustani mosquitoes were also confirmed by molecular methods.

N2  - Abstract Background Despite the low to moderate intensity of malaria transmission present in Ethiopia, malaria is still a leading public health problem. Current vector control interventions, principally long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying, when deployed alone or in combination, are insufficient to control the dominant vector species due to their exophagic and exophilic tendencies. Zooprophylaxis presents a potential supplementary vector control method for malaria; however, supporting evidence for its efficacy has been mixed. Methods To identify risk factors of malaria and to estimate the association between cattle and Anopheles vector abundance as well as malaria risk, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a village near Arba Minch, Ethiopia. Epidemiological surveys (households = 95, individuals = 463), mosquito collections using CDC light traps and a census of cattle and human populations were conducted. To capture environmental conditions, land cover and water bodies were mapped using satellite imagery. Risk factor analyses were performed through logistic, Poisson, negative binomial, and spatial weighted regression models. Results The only risk factor associated with self-reported malaria illness at an individual level was being a child aged 5 or under, where they had three times higher odds than adults. At the household level, variables associated with malaria vector abundance, especially those indoors, included socioeconomic status, the proportion of children in a household and cattle population density. Conclusions Study results are limited by the low abundance of malaria vectors found and use of self-reported malaria incidence. Environmental factors together with a household’s socioeconomic status and host availability played important roles in the risk of malaria infection in southwest Ethiopia. Cattle abundance in the form of higher cattle to human ratios may act as a protective factor against mosquito infestation and malaria risk. Humans should remain indoors to maximize potential protection against vectors and cattle kept outside of homes.

N2  - Abstract Plant growth promoting rhizo and endophytic bacteria were isolated from different parts of pepper from south eastern Ethiopia. Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGP) are those that may be used to promote plant growth and suppress plant diseases. The objectives of this study were to identify and characterize PGPB indigenous to pepper rhizosphere and endophyte bacteria in Ethiopia, and to determine their capacity to suppress Phytophthora capsici in pepper. From a total of 60 isolates, 20 were selected based on their in vitro antagonism activity of phytopathogens and plant growth promoting traits. From the total 60 strains representing, 38 rhizosphere, and 22 endophytic bacteria were identified based on biochemical assays of semi-automated Vitec 2 compact and ten potential bacteria further identified by molecular methods. Results revealed that only one isolate of rhizosphere and three endophytic bacteria showed more than 50% suppression of test pathogens. The isolates were evaluated for their ability to solubilize phosphate, as well as for ammonia, indole acetic acid, hydrogen cyanide, and biofilm production. The selected isolates produced (0.2–93 µg mL − 1 ) of indole-3-acetic acid, without supplemented with tryptophan, while supplemented with tryptophan it produces (11.23–159 µg mL − 1 ). The activities of plant growth-promoting were assessed by measuring their effect on the number of lateral roots, root and shoot length of Arabidopsis plants, and germination percentage of pepper plants. Pepper plants grown from seeds that were treated with these PGPB strains showed significantly higher levels of germination, seedling vigor, and growth, compared to non-treated control plants. Since these PGPB inoculants showed multiple characters useful to the host plants, they may be used as an alternative in the production of new, safe, and effective seed treatments as bio-fungicides. Generally, this work exhibits the potential of bacterial isolates to control Phytophthora infection and promote plant growth.

N2  - Potato is a high potential food security crop in Ethiopia due to its high yield potential and nutritional quality tuber, short growing period, and wider adaptability. Arsi administrative province is one of the potential potato growing areas in southern parts of Ethiopia. The potato is grown there as a field crop, and it substantially supplies potatoes to the whole country. Despite the suitability of this area for high quantity and quality potato production in the country, there are several constraints, which drastically affect to the low production and productivity of potato crop by smallholder farmers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potato seed system, storage, pre-planting treatment practices applied and marketing systems followed by potato producing farmers and to suggest improvement options. In this research, a combination of literature study, expert elicitation, group discussion, field observation, and questionnaire base survey were used. The result of this study showed that a number of factors constraining the system including: unavailability of high quality seed tubers, unavailability of improved varieties, unavailability of improved storage structure, low price of the produce and poor transportation. It is concluded that availability of improved potato varieties, improved storage facilities, use of pesticides and better marketing opportunities are crucial to improve the potato crop system, to alleviate poverty and improve food security of smallholder farmers in the Arsi area in particular and in the country in general.

N2  - Climate variability and change is a serious threat to the livelihoods of rural communities because they are very sensitive to such changes. This study identified farmers’ choice of and factors determining adaptation strategies to climate variability and change in Benishangul Gumuz regional state, western Ethiopia which is harshly affected by climate change stresses. Both primary and secondary data were used for the study. Primary data were collected from a randomly selected 395 sample households through interviewed using field-based questionnaires and focus group discussions. Relevant secondary data were also obtained from Benishangul Gumuz region Agriculture and Natural resource Bureau, national meteorological agency and different reports. Descriptive statistics were used to describe farmers’ adaptation strategies to climate change. Multivariate probit model was estimated to identify the factors determining households’ choice of adaptation strategies to climate change. The results of the model pointed out that the likelihood of households to adopt soil and water conservation practice, crop diversity, small scale irrigation, improved crop varieties, agrochemical applications and adjusting planting date were 64.7%, 70.4%, 65.5%, 64.2%, 63.6% and 58.9% respectively. The results also indicated that the joint likelihood of using all adaptation strategies was only 2.13% and the joint likelihood of failure to adopt all of the adaptation strategies was 2.82%. Moreover, Multivariate probit model confirmed that age, sex, education status, family size, dependency ratio, total land holding, farming experience, credit access, frequency of extension contacts, distance to the market, total livestock holding, farm income and off/non-farm income have a statistically significant impact on climate adaptation strategies. Therefore, policy makers should focus on towards supporting improved extension service, facilitating the availability of credit especially to adaptation technologies, improving farmers farm income earning opportunities, improving their literacy status, and improving their access to markets.

N2  - As the world experiences warmer weather, heat waves and flooding, the climate change is leading to the geographical expansion of mosquitos, which are known vectors of a range of infectious diseases like dengue, malaria, chikungunya, yellow fever, rift valley fever, West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis and Zika which affect millions of people worldwide (1). Climate change now threatens the spread of vector-borne diseases to previously low-risk areas in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas (2-7) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an additional 250,000 deaths per year will occur in the next decades as a result of malnutrition, heat stress and vector-borne diseases (8). World leaders have now acknowledged that the climate crisis is a health crisis, and on 3 December 2023, the first-ever 'Health Day' dedicated to tackling the health impact of climate at a UN Climate Conference (COP) was hosted by the UN climate conference (COP28) that took place in Dubai, UAE, from 30 November to 12 December 2023 (9). By December 3, 2023, 123 countries had endorsed the COP28 UAE Declaration on Climate Change and Health, expressing their grave concern about the negative impacts of climate change on health (9). As the climate crisis escalates, diseases transmitted by Aedes, Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes will likely expand their reach and significantly impact human health and wellbeing (2-4, 10). Aedes aegypti, the yellow-fever mosquito that originated in Africa (11), does not only carry yellow fever, but is also a vector of West Nile virus, chikungunya, dengue and Zika (7). This species is now found in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions worldwide and has recently been incriminated as a vector of Zika (7). In the Southeast Asian region, Ae. aegypti is the principal vector of dengue. It is well adapted to living near human populations in rural and urban areas and breeds in human-made containers that hold water, such as tires, buckets, and flowerpots, where they lay their eggs (11). Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is regarded as a secondary vector of dengue and is now considered as one of the most invasive species globally because of its strong ability to adapt to new environments (11). It is native to tropical and subtropical areas of Southeast Asia and breeds in natural habitats, including tree-holes, bamboo stumps and at the edges of tropical forests(11). It is, however, a highly adaptable species and, in recent years, has spread to Africa, Europe and the Americas through travel and sea trade and adapted to breeding in rural areas and human-made containers in urban settings (12). It has now genetically adapted to become a competent new vector of dengue and Chikungunya viruses (12). In Africa, the South Asian malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi, was described in Djibouti in 2012 but is now raising concerns after appearances in six other countries in Africa (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan) where malaria is endemic (13-15). The incidence of dengue, a vector-borne disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, increased dramatically from 500,000 cases in 2000 to 5.2 million in 2019 (10). A recent report by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also demonstrated the spread of different mosquito vector species that can cause many mosquito-borne diseases (3). As summers got longer and warmer, and heat waves and flooding became more common in recent years, there was a notable rise in dengue cases globally. As of October 2023, over 4.2 million cases and over 3, 000 dengue-related deaths have been reported from 79 countries/territories globally (3). Across Asia, nations like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malaysia have experienced a surge in cases of mosquito-borne diseases (16). South America has been severely affected by dengue in 2023, with Peru grappling with its most severe dengue outbreak on record (17). In Florida, USA, a rise in dengue cases prompted authorities to issue alerts in several counties (18). The recent outbreaks of dengue in Bangladesh exemplify the impact of climate change on the changing micro-ecology of the Aedes vectors and the rise in the risk of mosquito-borne infections in southeast Asia. A World Report published in The Lancet in August 2023 (19) predicted that Bangladesh will register record numbers of dengue cases in 2023 amid an accelerating outbreak. In October 2023, Bangladesh experienced its worst dengue outbreak on record when more than 1000 people died, and for the first time, more cases were recorded away from the dense urban centres (20). In contrast, only 281 deaths were recorded in 2022 (19). The epidemiological profile of dengue in Bangladesh has the infection typically peaking during the monsoon season between July and September. The typical dengue peak during the monsoon season shifted in 2023, starting three months earlier, due to favourable breeding conditions for the Aedes mosquitoes caused by a prolonged monsoon season with higher temperatures and irregular heavy rainfall. In Europe, as heat waves and flooding became more common in recent years, and summers got longer and warmer, Aedes albopictus was able to establish itself more northwards and westwards(3). Also, the yellow-fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti, which is known to transmit dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro and, potentially, West Nile viruses, has been established in Cyprus since 2022 and may continue to spread to other European countries(3, 21). Climate change and human behaviour are creating ecological conditions that are more favourable for these Aedes species to breed, and the incidence of West Nile virus and dengue has increased dramatically in the EU since 2010. In 2013, 114 regions in 8 countries were affected by Aedes albopictus. In 2023, the mosquito is well established in 13 countries and 337 regions(3). In 2022, active transmission of West Nile Virus was demonstrated in Italy, Greece, Romania, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Austria, France, Spain, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Altogether 1,133 human cases and 92 deaths of West Nile virus infection were reported, and 1, 112 were locally acquired in the 11 countries with active transmission. The number of locally acquired dengue cases in 2022 was the same as the 71 reported between 2010 and 2021. Active transmission of dengue was demonstrated in France and Spain (3). In the Americas, the 1.9 million dengue cases reported during the first five months of 2023 were more than the total reported for the region for the whole of 2021 and projected to surpass the 2.8 million registered in 2022 (10). Dengue outbreaks have also been reported in countries in Africa. According to a statement by the government of Burkina Faso, released on 19 October and reported by the Reuters News Agency (22), dengue fever has killed 214 people in Burkina Faso since January 1, 2023, mainly in the two largest cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso. There were 48 deaths reported from 9-15 October 2023 when the dengue epidemic coincided with an incidence of chikungunya. Zika virus disease is also being reported from new geographical regions. Since 2019, two more countries (France and Kenya) were added to the list of countries with evidence of autochthonous, mosquito-borne transmission (23, 24). An outbreak was reported from the southern Indian state of Kerala in May 2021, which was the first report of Zika virus disease in WHO south east region after the outbreak in the Northern Indian states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in 2018 (7). The movement of Anopheles mosquitoes across continents has hampered the recent progress against malaria in many countries in Africa. The main vectors of malaria in Africa are members of the Anopheles gambiae complex, including Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles coluzzii and Anopheles gambiae, and Anopheles funestus vivax parasites to humans (25). One threat to continued progress against malaria in Africa is the expansion of vectors into new areas. The South Asian vector, Anopheles stephensi, first reported in Djibouti in 2012 and recently discovered in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia and Somaliland (13-15, 26), is raising concerns about enhanced transmission of malaria in urban areas in Africa. It is an important vector of urban malaria in South Asia and the Middle East, including the Arabian Peninsula and northwards across southern China (25). Anopheles stephensi is well adapted to both rural and urban environments and breeds in various freshwater sources, including stagnant water bodies, rice fields, and water storage containers. It is a night-time feeder, primarily biting during the evening and night. It is known for its preference for biting humans and is considered an endophagic species, meaning it tends to rest indoors after feeding (11). Malaria cases are also on the rise in Europe. In 2021, the European Union (EU) reported 4,856 malaria cases, with the majority being travel-related, but there were also 13 confirmed cases acquired within the EU (four in Greece and nine in France). A marked seasonal trend was observed across all countries, with cases increasing during and immediately after the summer holiday months (July–September), most likely reflecting travel patterns to malaria-endemic countries (5). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning of locally acquired malaria cases in the United States, with concerns that malaria could become more common as temperatures rise (2). A recent study on climate change and malaria in Africa revealed a declining trend in malaria incidence rates from 2000 to 2018. However, these rates varied significantly, with high values in Uganda, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Zambia, and the vulnerability and changing climate may reverse the recent decline (27). Vector control has played a more substantial role in reducing the prevalence of many mosquito-borne diseases compared to pharmaceuticals or vaccines (28). However, the efficacy of vector control approaches is jeopardized by insecticide resistance, environmental concerns and the difficulties associated with manufacturing insecticidal materials in affected regions (29). To address these challenges, scientists should employ modern molecular tools to enhance our understanding of vectors, their relationships with parasites, and insecticide resistance in affected areas. Regrettably, major funding organizations supporting research and capacity development in developing countries, such as the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership, do not allocate resources to vector research (30). Developing research capabilities in vector biology and control is crucial to comprehend and monitor the changing patterns of mosquito-borne diseases. This is essential for addressing the challenges arising from the influence of climate change on vector behaviour and the transmission of diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, malaria, yellow fever, and Zika. In resource-limited settings, there is an urgent need to strengthen national capacities and capabilities to respond to the emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne diseases with epidemic potential. In Sierra Leone, the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) tool, a comprehensive, evidence-based strategy developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for enhancing the effectiveness of national public health surveillance and response systems, has been used to monitor the long-term trend and seasonal variation in malaria (31). We have demonstrated that climate change substantially affects the spread of vector-borne diseases. Many mosquito vectors of infectious diseases are already spreading across continents, aided by global trade and travel, and establishing in new areas previously unaffected by diseases like dengue and malaria. Changes at regional and national levels should be context- and disease-specific. To prevent the spread of vector-borne diseases, capacity enhancement is urgently needed in vector control and disease monitoring strategies. As of 3 December 2023, governments and development partners that participated in the COP28 Health Day had committed about US$ 1 billion to support knowledge generation, innovative financing, country capacity building, strategic partnerships, incubating innovations, and high-level advocacy on climate change and health (9) . 1.

N2  - In this review of coffee leaf rust (CLR) in Brazil, we report: (i) the historical introduction of CLR in Brazil and the first control measures; (ii) favorable environmental conditions and times of year for the disease; (iii) breeding methods and strategies used for developing CLR-resistant cultivars; (iv) the levels, sources, and types of CLR resistance; (v) the development of Brazilian resistant cultivars; and (vi) chemical and cultural control methods. Most plantations are cultivated with susceptible cultivars, such as those of the Catuaí and Mundo Novo groups. Brazilian research institutes have developed dozens of cultivars with different levels of resistance, and significantly increased the planting of new resistant cultivars. The main sources of CLR resistance are genotypes from Híbrido de Timor, Icatu, BA series carrying the SH3 gene, and Ethiopian wild coffees. High CLR resistance is still observed in Sarchimor and SH3-carrying genotypes. Intermediate CLR resistance is observed in Ethiopian wild coffees and in Sarchimor and Icatu derivatives, where qualitative resistance has been supplanted by races of Hemileia vastatrix. Contact, mesostemic, and systemic fungicides are used for chemical control in Brazil. CLR incidence in Brazil begins to increase after the rainy season onset in November, reaches a peak in June, and remains high until August. Thus, chemical control is typically applied from December to April.

N2  - Introduction The desert locust is regarded as the most destructive migratory pest worldwide. According to the United Nations, an average swarm of up to 40 million insects may cover 150 km in a day and consume enough food to feed 34 million people in that period. Adults deposit eggs, before they hatch, can produce a generation up to 20 times larger than the one before it, and can survive for up to 3 months1. Around 100 countries are threatened by massive locust outbreaks, with Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya being the worst affected. These epidemics pose a threat to the environment and agricultural output. For the years 1912 through 1989, there have been 6 significant locust outbreaks that have all been linked to prolonged droughts, mild winters, and the occurrence of substantial spring and summer precipitation. The most severe outbreaks were in East Africa, India, and Pakistan2. Afghanistan has been badly hit by a disastrous locust outbreak, which threatens one-quarter of the country’s annual harvest. According to Richard Trenchard, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization national representative, the large-scale breakout of Moroccan locusts will most likely be “devastating” in 8 key agricultural provinces, primarily in the North and Northeast. The locust breakout further aggravated the worst economic catastrophe in the country’s history3. The use of widely used pesticides in locust control, as well as the consumption of sprayed locusts shortly after spraying, has an adverse effect on the health of humans and has implications for the sustainability of ecosystem services and biodiversity4. The desert locust crisis According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the past 2 epidemics (20 y and 40 y ago) cost Afghanistan 8% and 25% of its annual wheat crop. A Moroccan locust outbreak this year alone might result in crop losses ranging from 700,000 to 1.2 million metric tons of wheat, accounting for up to a quarter of the annual harvest. If the Moroccan locust population is not managed, it might double by 100-fold next year, posing even more challenges for farming and food security in Afghanistan and its neighbors5. The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is one of 18–20 grasshopper species, with about 10 subspecies found in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, with the ability to swarm across long distances (10 h/d, up to 150 km), and is one of the oldest, largest, and most destructive migratory pests causing agricultural damage2. The desert locust has a 3–6 month life cycle and a mature female locust can lay roughly 100 eggs every day. The larvae grow quickly and mature in around 20 days, becoming the initiator of the following batch of insect pests (Fig. 1).Figure 1: The life cycle of locusts. Modified from2.

So in order to publish this adaptation, authorization must be obtained both from the owner of the copyright in the original work and from the owner of copyright in the translation or adaptation.Addressing the crisis In recent history, Afghanistan had 2 brushes with the Moroccan locust: one in 1981, when an outbreak took off over a quarter of the national harvest, and another in 2003, when it claimed a more modest 8% due to an improved locust-control effort. The Moroccan locust is one of the most economically devastating plant pests in the world, consuming around 150 distinct plant species, 50 of which are food crops and all of which are grown in Afghanistan. Locust sightings at various stages of development have been reported in Badakhshan, Badghis, Baghlan, Balkh, Kunduz, Samangan, Sar-e-Pul, and Takhar provinces, with new reports coming in from the Heart and Ghor regions3. Figure 2 illustrates the 6 big desert locust outbreaks recorded between 1912 and 1989, all of which were strongly linked to dry and warm weather during that period2.Figure 2: Annual locust outbreaks in the world for the past 150 years. Modified from2. Adaptations are themselves works protected by copyright. So in order to publish this adaptation, authorization must be obtained both from the owner of the copyright in the original work and from the owner of copyright in the translation or adaptation.Socioeconomic and humanitarian consequences The livelihoods of Afghanistan’s population have been severely compromised due to the infestation of desert locusts, resulting in detrimental health problems for the people residing. The locusts are infected with microbial pathogens that can lead to the outbreak of various diseases. The pesticides used can cause major illnesses presenting with respiratory and neurological symptoms if inhaled. This is further associated with fetal deaths, birth defects, and cancers. In addition, these locusts severely disrupt the crops grown in Afghanistan, the food shortage will lead to starvation, malnutrition, and growth retardation. The desert locust is currently responsible for the loss of agricultural productivity and widespread crop destruction. According to available statistics, the regions of Badakhshan, Badghis, Baghlan, Balkh, Kunduz, Samangan, Sar-e-Pul, and Takhar have recently experienced an estimated decrease of 1.2 million metric tons of wheat, accounting for ~25% of the total annual harvest6. This loss has not only impacted the income and livelihoods of farmers but has also disrupted the food supply chain, reducing food availability for both rural and urban populations. Given Afghanistan’s heavy reliance on domestic food production to meet its population’s dietary needs, the consequences of crop destruction are particularly severe, with the risk of famine looming over the country. Considering that agriculture serves as one of the most profitable sectors in Afghanistan, the instability caused by the locust infestation will lead to substantial economic losses. The devastating impact of the desert locust infestation extends beyond economic losses. Endemic areas affected by the locust invasion are seeing mass migration and displacement of communities. This humanitarian crisis has far-reaching implications, including increased health risks and the potential for disease outbreaks. Displaced populations often face inadequate access to health care, sanitation facilities, and clean water, exacerbating the vulnerability of already marginalized communities. Lessons from past experiences and best practices To address the escalating challenges, international and national authorities must respond promptly and supply adequate support in Afghanistan. Organizations like the World Bank Group have provided regions of Africa with a financing package totaling USD 160 million. Efforts to combat locusts are also receiving funding in Yemen ($25 million), Pakistan ($200 million), and Somalia ($40 million)7. Similarly in Afghanistan, immediate interventions should include the allocation of financial resources and the implementation of targeted programs to combat the locust outbreak, ensure food security, and support affected communities. Furthermore, long-term investments in agricultural research, early warning systems, and preventive measures are necessary to predict and mitigate the impacts of future locust infestations. There are encouraging examples of other countries effectively managing locust control. In Caucasus and Central Asia, West/Northwest Africa (the Western Region), and the Horn of Africa (the Central Region), success can be attributed to community involvement, early warning systems, and national monitoring systems8. India has an integrated pest management strategy, focusing on biological control techniques and resistant crop varieties9. The Abu Dhabi Agriculture and Food Safety Authority’s use of aerial spraying of 85,948 donums in infected regions and partnerships for resources highlights the value of global cooperation10. Afghanistan should establish a similar system that combines community-based surveillance and early warning mechanisms. Conclusion and call to action In conclusion, immediate and coordinated action is crucial to address the desert locust infestation in Afghanistan through global solidarity and coordinated efforts. Adequate funding and implementation of programs aimed at eradicating the crisis are essential. Moreover, investing in research, early warning systems, and preventive measures will help predict and prevent future locust outbreaks. By adopting initiative-taking approaches and taking preventive measures and preparedness, Afghanistan can mitigate the impact of locust infestations, safeguard its agricultural sector, and ensure food security for its population.

N2  - Abstract Introduction: The combined application of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) has led to mixed results (Significant reduction vs no impact) on malaria burden. Other studies have attempted to study the combined effects of house screening (HS) and LLINs have demonstrated a reduction in indoor vector densities and malaria when the interventions are combined. In addition to malaria vectored by mosquitoes, farmers living in rural settings face challenges from crop pests, which significantly reduce agricultural productivity and negatively impact their food security. Thus, addressing the coexisting risks of malaria and crop pests could contribute to the improved livelihood of communities. Design: A three-armed household, cluster-randomized, controlled study will be conducted to assess the impact of HS, LLINs, and PPT against clinical malaria in children than LLINs alone in Ethiopia. The unit of randomization will be the household, which includes a house and its occupants. A total of 663 households will be enrolled in this study. All the households will receive the LLINs. Then other treatments will be overlaid according to the randomization sequence. Thus, 246 households will receive HS, and 250 households will receive HS and PPT before the commencement of clinical follow-up. The rest 167 houses that received LLINs only will be used as control. One child aged not more than 14 years will be enrolled from each household and followed for clinical malaria using active case detection to estimate malaria incidence for two malaria transmission seasons. Results: Episodes of clinical malaria, the prevalence of anaemia, density of malaria vector mosquitoes, sporozoite infection rate, crop infestation rate due to stem borer and fall armyworm, crop yield gain, livestock productivity, and cost-effectiveness analysis will be the endpoints of this study. Socio-economic, social demographic, cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted using qualitative and participatory methods to explore the acceptability of HS and PPT. Conclusion Documenting the combined impact of LLINs, HS, and PPT on the prevalence of clinical malaria and crop pest damage will be the first of its kind and will provide deep insight and evidence base for forging collaborations between health and agriculture sectors.

N2  - Thrips, Thrips tabaci (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) on the cotton plant is an extremely invasive and destructive pest that reduces yield. Field studies were conducted at Werer Agricultural Research Center, Middle Awash, Afar, Ethiopia, for two consecutive years (2017 and 2018) to determine the effectiveness of different synthetic chemical insecticides for the control of cotton thrips (T. tabaci) on the Deltapine-90 cotton variety. A total of eleven treatments with untreated control were laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) replicated thrice per treatment. The field was sprayed two times with an economic threshold level attained in two weeks intervals after the first round of data. Thrips population count data on thrips populations were collected before and after three, five, seven and ten days of insecticide application. The yield and yield component, and economic returns data were also collected. The percent efficacy was calculated using a modified Abbott's formula. The efficacy of the insecticide Rectro 20% Sc, Imidacloprid 20% SC, Closer 240% SC and Dimethoate 40% EC resulted in fewer numbers of thrips and higher yields than Diazinon 60% EC, Chlorpyrifos 48% EC, Chloropyrafose 36 SC, Deltamethrin 06% and Curadore 45%. The economic analysis of the insecticides chemical showed good cost-benefit for Rectro 20% SC (2.55), Closer 240% SC (1.93) and Dimethoate 40% EC (1.49) with good advantage. Additionally, the protection of cotton thrips using the insecticide chemicals namely Imdacloropride 20% SC, Rectro 20% Sc and Curador 45% EC would return 1.33, 1.24 and 1.24 birr return. The result confirmed that the application of more effective insecticides when the thrips population was high resulted in better control and higher economic returns. Therefore, the use of sequential applications in the insecticides, Closer 240% SC, Dimethoate 40% EC, Rectro 20%SC and Imidacloprid is recommended to manage the cotton thrips in the middle awash areas of Ethiopia. Key words: Insect pest, resistance, management, insecticides, sequential, economic returns.

N2  - Abstract The malaria vector, Anopheles stephensi , which is typically restricted to South Asia and the Middle East, was recently detected in the Horn of Africa. Controlling the spread of this vector could involve integrated vector control that considers the status of insecticide resistance of multiple vector species in the region. Previous reports indicate that the knockdown resistance mutations ( kdr ) in the voltage-gated sodium channel ( vgsc ) are absent in both pyrethroid resistant and sensitive variants of An. stephensi in east Ethiopia but similar information on other vector species in the same areas is limited. In this study, kdr and the neighboring intron was analyzed in An. stephensi , An. arabiensis , and Culex pipiens s. l . collected in east Ethiopia between 2016 and 2017. Sequence analysis revealed that all of Cx. pipiens s.l. (n = 42) and 71.6% of the An. arabiensis (n=67) carried kdr L1014F known to confer target-site pyrethroid resistance. Intronic variation was only observed in An. stephensi (segregating sites = 6, haplotypes = 3) previously shown to have no kdr mutations. In addition, no evidence of non-neutral evolutionary processes was detected at the An. stephensi kdr intron which further supports target-site mechanism not being a major resistance mechanism in this An. stephensi population. Overall, these results suggest differences in evolved mechanisms of pyrethroid/DDT resistance in populations of vector species from the same region. Variation in insecticide resistance mechanisms in East Ethiopian mosquito vectors highlight possible species or population specific biological factors and distinct environmental exposures that shape their evolution.

N2  - Ethiopia has huge potential for beekeeping production and 1st in honey production in Africa because of its endowment with diversity in climate and vegetation resources offering potentially favorable conditions for beekeeping. It is important for sources of food and beverages, medication, income generation, creating employment opportunities, environmental balance through pollination. Even though it has a higher contribution, the sector is yet not potentially utilized due to various constraints. Therefore the objectives of this paper are to review the production constraints of honey in Ethiopia and to review the marketing constraints of honey in Ethiopia. Pests, Disease and Predators; weather problem; Shortage of bee forage; Absconding; shortage of trained manpower; shortage of equipment; poor management practices; chemicals; weak research and extension; poor infrastructures and etc. are constraints of honey production in Ethiopia. While linkages problem; lack of market center; lack of market information; price fluctuation; low awareness of post-harvest handling; lack of technology; poor market infrastructure, lack basic business concepts; and etc. are constraints honey marketing in Ethiopia. To overcome such constraints:- Adopting effective honeybee pests, disease and predators controlling methods; Introducing and expanding of full package improved beekeeping technologies with adequate practical skill; strengthen full package extension services; Support farmers for beekeeping business through credit availability, improving the barging power of beekeepers, strengthen linkage among different concerned institutions, cooperative formation, input supply, market facilitation and infrastructures as a whole; Giving attention on research and human resources development ; Expanding coverage of flowering plants especially economically important ones like horticultural crops and reducing the impact of agrochemicals and others are suggested recommendations.

N2  - In developing countries, widely reported incidents of dangerous levels of pesticides in food have stimulated the demand for organic food, a movement to choose organic agriculture. It also makes more people have desires to consume chemical free foods. This study, therefore, assessed the consumers’ awareness of their eight basic rights and willingness to pay for organic vegetables in Ethiopia. The data were collected from 200 respondents (consumers) from Addis Ababa and 80 smallholder vegetable farmers at Ziway and Meki through a combination of random and purposive sampling procedures using a structured interview and were analyzed using descriptive analysis. The results show that vegetable producers used a lot of chemicals, but not in a safe way or at the optimum level. The findings also show that the overall degree of consumers’ awareness on the eight consumer rights is low. Furthermore, willingness to pay premium prices about 5-50% to obtain organic products, which can be viewed as the cost of investment in human health, is encouraging. There is a need to target agricultural policies relating to handling practices and for public health policies to be more differentiated in promoting food safety. Informing consumers about unique characteristics of organic production methods, the strict inspection and required third party certification might be a promising strategy to develop the market for organic vegetables in Ethiopian urban centers.

N2  - Background: Bacterial wilt incited by Ralstonia solanacearum is the most important disease affecting ginger production in southwestern Ethiopia. Unavailability of disease-free planting materials, resistant cultivars, and effective chemical compounds are the key constraints in managing the disease. Objective: The study was initiated to determine the effect of integrated management methods on bacterial wilt disease and yield loss of ginger through combining hot water, bio-fumigation, soil-solarization and chemical pesticides. Methods: A total of seven treatment combinations comprising hot water, bio-fumigation, soil-solarization, Mancozeb, and bleaching powder were tested in a randomized complete block design in three replications. Data on disease incidence, growth, yield, and yield components were recorded from randomly selected plants. Results: The use of Mancozeb for seed socking and soil drenching combined with bio-fumigation and soil-solarization reduced the incidence of bacterial wilt by 63.3% and enhanced the rhizome yield by 66.8%. Rhizome and soil treatment using bleaching powder along with soil bio-fumigation also reduced the disease incidence by 38.9% and increased ginger yield by 61.5%. It also provided the highest (6678.7%) marginal rate of return of any treatment combination tested in the experiment. Disease incidence was highly significantly and inversely (r= -0.98**) correlated with rhizome yield. The regression slope estimated that 83.4% of ginger yield loss was associated with the bacterial wilt disease. Conclusion: A combined application of Mancozeb, bio-fumigation and soil-solarization can be used to control ginger bacterial wilt. Alternatively, bleaching powder for rhizome and soil treatment in conjunction with bio-fumigation can be employed as an integrated management system against the disease.

N2  - In The Lancet Global Health, Daniel Leventhal and colleagues1Leventhal DGP Crochemore-Silva I Vidaletti LP Armenta-Paulino N Barros AJD Victora CG Delivery channels and socioeconomic inequalities in coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions: analysis of 36 cross-sectional surveys in low-income and middle-income countries.Lancet Glob Health. 2021; 9: e1101-e1109Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar report their cross-sectional study of delivery channels and socioeconomic inequalities in the coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) interventions in low-income and middle-income countries. The authors used secondary data from Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) from 36 low-income and middle-income countries to analyse 20 key indicators across four RMNCH distribution channels. These channels were: facility-based interventions, community-based interventions, environmental interventions, and so-called cultural interventions. The objective of this study was to measure the extent of inequality in the indicators studied, taking into account the distribution channels. The authors found that, of all the indicators, environmental indicators (cooking fuels, sanitation, running water) showed the greatest inequality of distribution or use in favour of wealthy women, children, and households. This observation is easily understood because the acquisition of these environmental indicators requires availability of resources related to the cost of housing and water and sanitation facilities. On the other hand, community-based interventions showed the lowest inequality in distribution or use across households because they are usually delivered by community health workers at little or no cost to families. Such interventions include immunisations, management of common diseases (such as malaria, diarrhoea, and pneumonia), and insecticide-treated bednets or household spraying.1Leventhal DGP Crochemore-Silva I Vidaletti LP Armenta-Paulino N Barros AJD Victora CG Delivery channels and socioeconomic inequalities in coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions: analysis of 36 cross-sectional surveys in low-income and middle-income countries.Lancet Glob Health. 2021; 9: e1101-e1109Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar In this study, family planning services were included in the community-based interventions category; however, these services might be provided at the community level, in health facilities, or a combination of both depending on the country. Cultural indicators (in this study, exclusive breastfeeding until age 6 months and continued breastfeeding to age 12–15 months) showed inequality of uptake in favour of poor women, children, and households. The authors justify these behaviours as being culturally driven because they are not substantially affected by health services, and are instead determined by culture and economics (eg, affordability of formula milk and of clean water to prepare it).1Leventhal DGP Crochemore-Silva I Vidaletti LP Armenta-Paulino N Barros AJD Victora CG Delivery channels and socioeconomic inequalities in coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions: analysis of 36 cross-sectional surveys in low-income and middle-income countries.Lancet Glob Health. 2021; 9: e1101-e1109Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar However, overall, the interventions in health facilities showed an absolute inequality in favour of distribution, access, or use by wealthy women, children, and households. These interventions included antenatal and postnatal care and institutional delivery. This observed inequity is due to geographical (distance from fixed facilities) and cultural barriers (such as women being unable to leave the house unaccompanied), and costs related to payment for services (in many countries) and transport. The results of this study show that the ways in which socioeconomic inequalities strongly contribute to uptake of these interventions, particularly when it comes to some delivery channels. In this respect, environmental indicators and interventions in health facilities are eloquent examples—for environmental interventions, people with sufficient economic resources have less difficulty in obtaining them than many other interventions, and for in health facility interventions inequality is more substantial among poor households and communities.2Ganle JK Parker M Fitzpatrick R Otupiri E A qualitative study of health system barriers to accessibility and utilization of maternal and newborn healthcare services in Ghana after user-fee abolition.BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2014; 14: 425Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar Finally, access to the benefits of RMNCH interventions reveals a clear gap between wealthy and poor women, children, and households.1Leventhal DGP Crochemore-Silva I Vidaletti LP Armenta-Paulino N Barros AJD Victora CG Delivery channels and socioeconomic inequalities in coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions: analysis of 36 cross-sectional surveys in low-income and middle-income countries.Lancet Glob Health. 2021; 9: e1101-e1109Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar A factor that contributes to inequality in health facility-based interventions that is not included in the analyses in this Article is the mistreatment of women by health-care providers during antenatal care and facility-based childbirth (eg, shouting or slapping).3Bohren MA Mehrtash H Fawole B et al.How women are treated during facility-based childbirth in four countries: a cross-sectional study with labour observations and community-based surveys.Lancet. 2019; 394: 1750-1763Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar The absence of a childbirth companion contributes to increased rates of mistreatment of women during facility-based childbirth in low-income countries.4Balde MD Nasiri K Mehrtash H et al.Labour companionship and women's experiences of mistreatment during childbirth: results from a multi-country community-based survey.BMJ Glob Health. 2020; 5e003564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar Variations in antenatal care have not been extensively discussed in the Article by Leventhal and colleagues; however, the success of childbirth is highly dependent on the success of the antenatal consultation.

In summary, this is a very interesting study that highlights the importance of distributional channels for RMNCH interventions to achieve greater equity between wealthy and poor households. For future analyses, the inclusion of reproductive health among adolescents will be of great importance as part of Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescents Health (known as RMNCH+A) activities. I declare no competing interests. Delivery channels and socioeconomic inequalities in coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions: analysis of 36 cross-sectional surveys in low-income and middle-income countriesInterventions that are often delivered at community level are usually more equitably distributed than those primarily delivered in fixed facilities or those that require changes in the home environment. Policy makers need to learn from community delivery channels to promote more equitable access to all RMNCH interventions. Full-Text PDF Open Access

N2  - Crop water requirement and irrigation scheduling in Lower Kulfo Catchment of southern Ethiopia have not assessed under climate change scenarios, and the allocation of crop land also not optimal that signifcantly challenges to crop productivity.Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of climate change on future crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling, and to allocate cropland optimally. Bias of projected precipitation and temperature were corrected by utilizing Climate Model data with the hydrologic modeling tool (CMhyd). Alongside, crop water requirements and irrigation scheduling were assessed using Crop Water Assessment Tool. After estimating crop water requirement, crop land were allocated optimally using General Algebraic Modeling System programming with non-negativity constraints (scenario 1), and non-negativity constraints based on farmers adaptation (scenario 2). Average reference evapotranspiration from 2030 to 2050 and 2060 to 2080 was increased by 11.9%, and 16.2%, respectively compared with the reference period (2010-2022). The total seasonal crop water requirements were 4,529mm, 4,866.7mm, and 5,272.2mm under 2010 to 2022, 2030 to 2050, and 2060 to 2080 climate change scenarios, respectively. The meean irrigation interval in 2010 to 2022, 2030 to 2050, and 2060 to 2080 climate change scenarios were 8 days, 7 days, and 5 days, respectively. This irrigation interval was decreased by 14% (2030 to 2050), and 34% (2060 to 2080) compared with the reference period. In 2030 to 2050 and 2026 to 2080 climate change scenarios, the required irrigation water at the inlet of main canal increased by 6.8%, and 18%, respectively. The optimal allocated area for tomato (60.4%), maize (20.8%), and watermelon (18.8%) in scenario 1 with net benefit of 1.47*108 Ethiopian Birr. The allocated areas in scenario 2 were (48%) for maize, (31.6%) for tomato, and (20.4%) for watermelon with 1.34*108 Ethiopian Birr net benefit it was reduced by 19.1% compared with the net benefit in scenario 1. Fruit crops alone may not suffice for local food needs and to address this, small farmers should grow maize, tomato, and watermelon. This research aids policymakers in encouraging climate-resilient agriculture and improving small-scale farmers' awareness through conducting workshops and training.

During dry season, there was water conflict among the water users in Lower Kulfo Catchment due to the scarcity of irrigation water and the amount of irrigation demand showed an increasing trend as observed during problem investigation that may be due to climate change. Absence of estimated crop water requirement and lack of proper irrigation scheduling practices in the Lower Kulfo Catchment was significantly disturbed water management and distribution. Addition to this, rainfall variability and shifting of wet season also the major problems in the lower Kulfo catchment that hinder rainfed/irrigated agriculture in the area. Stream flow of the Kulfo River will be decreased by 2.99% in the 2050s and 5.28% in the 2080s due to climate change impact [20N. G. Demmissie, T. A. Demissie, and F. G. Tufa, "Predicting the Impact of Climate Change on Kulfo River Flow," vol. 6, no. 3, pp. 78–87, 2018, doi: 10.11648/j.hyd.20180603.11.Google Scholar]. But there was no any conducted research in Lower Kulfo Catchment to evaluate the impacts of climate change on crop water requirement and irrigation scheduling. Both land and water productivity of crops Arba Minch irrigation in the Lower Kulfo Catchment are low [21Reta B.G. Hatiye S.D. Finsa M.M. Assessment of Irrigation Water Management Performance Indicators and Mitigation Measure in Arba Minch Irrigation.Adv. Agric. 2024; Google Scholar] and that may be lack of knowledge about user-friendly crop optimization tools for identifying economical crops to the area. Traditional allocation of cropland was adopted by irrigation users in the lower Kulfo catchment that was due to lack of understanding regarding affordable crop optimization programming like GAMS code. Poor optimal cropland allocation under multiple cropping patterns undermines the effectiveness of an irrigation scheme, leading to reduced crop yields, increased operational costs, market value fluctuations, and environmental degradation [22Yubing Fan S.C.P. R. M.Multi-Crop Production Decisions and Economic Irrigation Water Use Efficiency : The Effects of Water Climatic Determinants.Water. 2018; 10https://doi.org/10.3390/w10111637Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar]. These agricultural-related problems can be solved by developing reasonable irrigation scheduling and estimating crop water requirements under climate change scenarios, and optimal cropland allocation is also used to identify the most economical crops in the area. Therefore, this study was conducted to estimate crop water requirement and irrigation scheduling for the worst dry season under three climate change scenarios and to allocate cropland under multiple crop systems in the lower Kulfo catchment using GAMS code programming. The significance of this research lies in its potential to address critical challenges in the lower Kulfo catchment, offering solutions for optimizing water resources, improving agricultural productivity, and fostering sustainable practices in the face of climate change. Lower Kulfo catchment was located between 6 2' 0" and 6 5' 0" North latitude and 37 33'0" and 37 36'0" East longitudes of Southern Ethiopia (Figure 1). Elevation of thestudy area was varied from 1200 to 1203.8m above the mean sea. The Lower Kulfo catchment was located near Arba Minch town, running alongside the main road connecting Arba Minch to Mirab Abaya and Wolayita Sodo and this location holds significant importance for the efficient transportation of fruit production to the market. Arba Minch irrigation, Arba Minch University (AMU) farmland, smallhold farmer in the Kola Shara district, and private farmland near the Arba Minch airport were included in the study area. The irrigated area of the Arba Minch irrigation scheme, Arba Minch University farm, Kolla shara farmland, private farmland 1, and private farmland 2 in Lower Kulfo Catchment were 835.22ha, 109.17ha, 160.23ha, 18.44ha, and 52.76ha, respectively, and the total irrigable land was 1175.82ha (Figure 1). The water source of the Lower Kulfo Catchment was Kulfo River and the annual minimum, and maximum flow of the River were 2.35m3/s and 50.73m3/s, respectively. Market survey was conducted to collect local price of the dominant crop in the study area and the survey included both sellers and buyers in the market which helps to identify crops that are used by people since only crop prices are not used to justify whether the crop is profitable or not. Field observation was conducted around the Lower Kulfo Catchment to investigate the most practical agricultural crop and this field observation also used to understand the agronomic performance of crops in the area. Both quantitative and qualitative data regarding crop production practices such as land size, costs of crop production, existing farming practices, and productivity of crops per hectare were collected through household survey questionnaires, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. This data was used to estimate the costs and revenues of crop production per hectare for each crop. Based on the [23A. Wright, D. Hudson, and M. Mutuc, "A Spatial Analysis of Irrigation Technology," vol. 2013, pp. 307–318, 2013.Google Scholar], simplified formula, the sample size for household interviews in Kolla shara Kebele was calculated as described in Eq 1.(1) Where n and N are sample size and total population size respectively, and e is expected error (5%) at a 95% confidence level. The total population and available agricultural land were collected from Arba Minch Zuria Woreda office. The total irrigated land in Kolla Shara Kebele that will be irrigated with the Kulfo River was estimated with ArcGIS software after collecting of ground control point (Table 1).Table 1population and sample size to conduct the household interview in Kolla shareTotal population10,794Number of farmers886Available agricultural land (ha)1,974Probable area irrigated by Kulfo River (ha)160.2Number of farmers under irrigated land (N)72Expected error (e)5% @95% confidence levelSample size to conduct a household interview61 Open table in a new tab Methods of soil sampling were composite techniques and the maximum sampling depth is 0.9m.

Soil chemical properties such as soil organic matter and electric conductivity also estimated laboratory that used to justify present status of soil fertility. Soil field capacity and permanent wilting point were estimated by using pressure plate apparatus in the laboratory. Based on [24Goebel T.S. Lascano R.J. Acosta-Martinez V.

As a result, the future temperature and precipitation of the current study was derived from the sixth phase of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6). To utilized bias correction, historical temperature and precipitation were collected from the Arba Minch meteorological station. Temperature, and precipitation network Common Data Form (netCDF) files were extracted using coordinate and elevation of Arba Minch meteorological station. The Climate Model data for hydrologic modeling tool (CMhyd) was employed for bias correction of rainfall and temperature and based on [26Leander R. Buishand T.A.

Based on [27R. G. Allen, L. S. Pereira, D. Raes, and M. Smith, "FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 - Crop Evapotranspiration," no. November 2017, 1998.Google Scholar], reference evapotranspiration (ETo), crop water requirement (CWR), effective rainfall (Pe), irrigation water requirement (IWR), and irrigation interval (i) were evaluated through CropWat under different climate change scenarios. This climate scenario was 2010 to 2022 (reference), 2030 to 2050, and 2060-2080 and this future climate change was only temperature and rainfall. Projected solar radiation, humidity, wind speed and sunshine hours are not available in the Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) model as result historical value of reference period was used to estimate reference evapotranspiration in all climate change scenarios. The driest season of study area was from January to April as a result, reference evapotranspiration, crop water requirement, and irrigation scheduling were evaluated for this worst condition in all climate change scenarios. Crop coefficients of each crop for initial, mid, and late stages were collected from irrigation and drainage manual paper number 56 (FAO 56) as presented in Table 2 but crop coefficients of teff were not found in the FAO paper. Length of crop growing stage, root depth, yield reduction factor, allowable management depletion, and planting and harvesting date of crops were also collected from FAO irrigation and drainage paper. The crop coefficients of teff in central Rift Valley Lake Basin, Ethiopia were 0.46 (initial stage), 0.88 (development stage), 1.03 (mid-stage), and 0.57 (late stage) [28T.

Res. 1985; 21: 1329-1335https://doi.org/10.1029/WR021i009p01329Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar] as described in Eq 10..(10) Where; Pi, Yi, Xi, and Ci were price for the crop "i" (birr/ton), the yield of the crop "i" (ton/ha), allocated area for crop "i" (ha) and production cost for the crop "i" (birr/ha), respectively. Total production cost was including labor, fertilizer, pesticides, and insecticides cost and total irrigated land, water availability, expected outcome, total production cost and non-negativity were constraints of the objective function. Lengths of crop development stages for various planting periods were collected from [27R. G. Allen, L. S. Pereira, D. Raes, and M. Smith, "FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 - Crop Evapotranspiration," no. November 2017, 1998.Google Scholar] and crop planting was start in January according to the guidelines outlined in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage paper and only permanent banana crops persist year-round. Onions can be harvested by the end of March, while wheat crops require five months from the time of planting and irrigation will be stope after four months except perennial banana crop. The sum of allocated areas for each crop will not exceed the total available land (At) as describe in Eq 11.(11) Where X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, and X8 are allocated areas for crop onion, maize, watermelon, pepper, wheat, banana, Teff, and tomato, respectively (ha) and At=total irrigated land (ha). The multiple product of irrigated land (ha) and gross irrigation depth (mm) was used to calculate the total volume of irrigation water. This value to be less than or equal to the seasonal minimum amount of water that could be obtained from the sources. Crop water requirement and effective rainfall under the reference period (2010 to 2022) was used to develop the Equation of water availability constraint and crop water requirement of banana after four months not included (Eq 12).(12) Where; CWR=crop water requirement for the crop "i" (m), Peff=effective rainfall (m), Vmin= annual minimum volume of water supply (ha-m). The expected crop yield represents the highest achievable productivity of a crop per hectare when soil quality is optimal, irrigation is managed effectively, and there is sufficient rainfall or irrigation water available. This expected maximum productivity data is sourced from the Irrigation and Drainage Paper Manual Number 33 (FAO 33). The primary aim of this research is to maximize the overall expected yield from the crops (Eq 13).(13) Where YI is the average expected land productivity for each crop (ton/ha) and TYc=Expected total yield from all crops (ton). The sum of the production costs for each crop should not exceed with actual total production cost as describe in Eq 14.(14) Where; PCi and TPC were crop production cost for crop I (Birr/ha) and total production cost (Birr) respectively. Non-negativity constraints of optimization were had two scenarios such as allocated land for each crop was non-negativity (scenario 1) and the remaining non-negativity constraints also depend on small-hold farmer practices (scenario 2). The remaining constraints (such as land, water, expected yield, and production cost) were common in both scenarios. The allocated area for each crop were considered as non-negativity during the GAMS code optimization (scenario 1).X1>=0, X2>=0, X3>=0, X4>=0, X5>=………………………………………………………………………….X8>=0 Based on the household interview, the minimum area that covered by the maize crop under scenario 2 optimization was 564.9ha (48% of total area). Because only fruit and vegetable production will not cover food consumption in Lower Kulfo Catchment due to that smallhold farmers allocate more land for maize. The other optimization also evaluated under 48% area covered by maize crop in ordered to satisfy household food security in the area (scenario 2).X1>=0, X2>=564.9ha, X3>=0, X4>=0, X5>=………………………………………..……X8>=0 Average soil texture was clay and the mean value of soil bulk density, soil organic matter, electric conductivity, field capacity, permanent wilting point, and total available water were 1.32 gm/cm3, 0.87%, 0.16ds/m, 38.3%, 25.9%, and 124mm/m, respectively (Table 3). Based on [27R. G. Allen, L. S. Pereira, D. Raes, and M. Smith, "FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 - Crop Evapotranspiration," no. November 2017, 1998.Google Scholar], the maximum total available water of the clay soil varied from 110 to 160mm/m, and the value of the current study was also found with the recommended value that was 127mm/m. The soil was suitable for agricultural practices to be uncompacted with a bulk density of less or equal to 1.63gm/cm3 [31Twum E.K.A. Nii-Annang S.

N2  - Nowadays, machine learning algorithms and methods are used in multiple areas of studies to achieve practical and productive solutions. Agriculture is one of the industries where the impact issignificant, especially in the area of crop yield prediction and crop selection which is crucial for ensuring food security and improving agricultural practices. In a country like Ethiopia, where the economy is highly dependent on agriculture, and farming in particular, leveraging the powers of AI and machine learning is crucial. However, the use of these technologies in Ethiopian agriculture remains limited, mainly due to the lack of well-organized and digital datasets and lack of technological advancements. The aim of this study is to increase the accuracy of crop yield prediction in Ethiopia and provide information that can help farmers and policymakers improve crop productivity. In this study, a crop yield prediction model was developed based on historical data that includes factors such as crop type, rainfall, temperature, Area cultivated, production, and pesticides. Among the algorithms considered in this study, GradientBoostingRegressor achieved the highest value of the R-square – 90% compared to others which indicates its best predictive ability. However, the study also acknowledges the contextual advantages of other algorithms, highlighting the importance of selecting models that are appropriate for specific data sets and purposes. The accuracy and efficiency of agricultural planning and resource allocation in Ethiopia can be greatly improved by using machine learning techniques for crop production prediction.

N2  - Abstract Background Cholangiocarcinoma(CCA) is an important public health problem in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world. Eucalyptus camaldulensis leaves as well as its essential oil extracts are well known for its traditional use and pharmacological actions including insect repellant/insecticidal activity, antimicrobial, cytotoxic/anticancer activity as well as for many other disorders in different parts of the world including Africa and Southeast Asia. Materials and Methods This study was conducted to investigate the cytotoxic activity of E. camaldulensis leaf extract preparations at in vitro against the CCA tumor (CL-6 cell line). E. camaldulensis leaves collected from Ethiopia (Western Gojjam and Southern Gonder area) was used for extract preparation in 95% ethanol using different extraction methods, i.e. ,ultrasonication, heating reflux, and maceration (1 day, 3 days and 7 days). The extract and the standard anticancer drug preparation 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were evaluated in triplicate for their cytotoxic activities against CL-6 cell line and normal human cell line (OUMS) using standard MTT cell proliferation assay at eight serial dilution concentrations (3.8–500µg/mL). Results A semi-solid brown black residue with a characteristic odor was obtained after solvent removal and extract concentration was done by using a rotary evaporator at 60 o C. The highest (mean ± SD) percent yield (3.73 ± 0.61) was obtained by using maceration technique with the solvent for 7 days, followed by heating reflux (1.73 ± 0.80) and the least was obtained from 1day maceration method (0.90 ± 0.52). The extract was then stored at -20 o C until use. The cytotoxic activity (mean ± SD IC 50 values) E. camaldulensis extract and 5-FU against CL-6 were 102.29 ± 5.87 and 106.75 ± 3.06 (mean IC 50 ± SD) µg/mL, respectively. The extract’s IC 50 value observed in normal OUMS cell line was 165.9 ± 10.3. Conclusion The extract of E. camaldulensis collected from the study area exhibited in vitro cytotoxic activity against human CCA tumor cell line (CL-6). Further in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the selected herbal extract preparation is recommended in the search for development of safe and promising drug options against CCA and other cancer types.

N2  - With more than a third of the world's population exposed to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and around 1 billion people infected at any time, it's hard to understand how the word “neglected” can possibly be part of the terminology. Onchocerciasis, lymphatic filariasis, schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and trachoma are the five most common NTDs, and there are many more. Affected individuals often have multiple NTDs, which leads to a vicious cycle of poverty and illness and also results in about half a million deaths each year. David Molyneux, of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, has dedicated his 40-year career to fighting these diseases. Molyneux, who coordinated The Lancet's series on NTDs that begins this week, has had a long association with the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, where he took his first position as a lecturer after degrees in zoology and parasitology from Cambridge University. Between 1970 and 1972, he worked in Africa at the Nigerian Institute of Trypanosomiasis Research, where he gained invaluable first-hand experience of many NTDs. After returning to Liverpool, Molyneux worked on leishmania parasites and then, in 1975, was recruited by WHO to run a project in what is now Burkina Faso, developing diagnostic techniques for African trypanosomiasis and new approaches to spraying insecticides on the tsetse flies that spread the disease. This project eventually extended across Africa. “It was quite a complex, challenging project”, Molyneux recalls. “As an English person in a Franco-African environment, it was difficult arranging helicopters, insecticides, and flying experts in and out.” In 1977, Molyneux settled back in the UK with his young family, and became Chair of Biological Sciences, and later Dean of the Faculty of Science, at the University of Salford. But his interest in tropical medicine continued to flourish, especially in WHO and partners' onchocerciasis programme. When he returned to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine as its Director, in 1991, he says that funding was scarce: “At that time, there was no Gates Foundation, and the Department for International Development (DFID) was reorganising previous core support to the School.” However, in 1997, DFID approached Molyneux to develop a partnership with GlaxoSmithKline to eliminate filariasis. DFID would provide £1 million per year while GlaxoSmithKline would supply albendazole free until 2020. And from this collaboration the Global Alliance for the Elimination of Filariasis was formed. Molyneux only stepped down as Director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in 2000, after DFID assured him that support for filariasis would be for at least 5 years. The programme now treats half a billion people in 51 countries each year. “David Molyneux is one of the most original and innovative minds I have come across and a mentor for many of us in WHO with his extensive experience in the control and elimination of several tropical diseases”, says Lorenzo Savioli, Director of WHO's Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases. Advocacy on NTDs began to accelerate with the establishment of WHO's NTD Department in 2005. Although there is no support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation began to show an interest and the US and UK Governments have both recently stepped up funding in this area. Funding is a critical issue: funds for NTDs represent just 0·6% of total international development assistance, compared with 37% for HIV/AIDS. It is a gap Molyneux has never understood, especially when there are drugs for many of these diseases available at low cost or donated free from pharmaceutical companies. “If we can't deliver free drugs to poor people which actually have multiple impacts, I don't think there is much else we can do in international health”, he says. Molyneux has been criticised by the HIV and malaria communities for his comments on funding distribution. Taking Ethiopia as an example, Molyneux says he cannot understand why HIV, which affects less than 2% of the population, receives US$135 million, and the rest of the Ethiopian health system receives $35 million. “If this situation arose in the UK, there would be riots”, he asserts. The Gates Foundation has given its support to publicise NTDs, but more must be done and Molyneux says there are encouraging signs from DFID, USAID, and G8 countries that NTDs are moving up the agenda. “My position has always been that if you are going to do anything about the MDGs which have the overall objective of taking people out of poverty then you had better to do something about the diseases which affect the most people rather than those that affect the minority”, he says. Molyneux believes the best solution would be incorporation of NTDs into the Global Fund portfolio and that attention must be given to sustainable interventions that reach beyond health systems. He points out that many communities affected by onchocerciasis are at least 20 km from the nearest health facility, yet they receive treatment. “We need to pick the low-hanging fruit—that is, do what we can do now with what we have now—we can't simply wait for health systems to develop in countries”. Molyneux adds that: “The voiceless poor are disenfranchised. People at policy level believe only malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV exist. The other diseases of MDG 6 are totally ignored, but cause as large a burden as malaria and tuberculosis.” Snake bite: time to stop the neglectA Series about neglected tropical diseases, for which David Molyneux provided advice and helped to coordinate, starts in The Lancet today. These diseases affect people in the bottom billion, the poorest in the world. Additionally, snake bite , which was added to WHO's list of neglected tropical diseases in April, 2009, is discussed by David Warrell in a Seminar and by David Williams, from the perspective of the Global Snake Bite Initiative, in a Viewpoint. Like the other diseases on WHO's list, snake bite affects mainly the poorest people in the world; however, unlike the others, it is a non-communicable disease. Full-Text PDF Neglected tropical diseases—beyond the tipping point?A Series starting in The Lancet today1 is a tipping point to ensure that some of the most prevalent infections of the world's poorest people gain recognition. These diseases and the billion people that they afflict are worthy of a fairer share of global health assistance than previously committed, and of increased attention from the research community in view of their prevalence and burden of disease (panel). Full-Text PDF Programmes, partnerships, and governance for elimination and control of neglected tropical diseasesNeglected tropical diseases represent one of the most serious burdens to public health. Many can be treated cost-effectively, yet they have been largely ignored on the global health policy agenda until recently. In this first paper in the Series we review the fragmented structure of elimination and control programmes for these diseases, starting with the ambiguous definition of a neglected tropical disease. We describe selected international control initiatives and present their effect, governance arrangements, and financing mechanisms, including substantial drug-donation programmes. Full-Text PDF

N2  - Dengue viral infection is caused by the dengue virus (DENV), which belongs to the Flaviviridae family of minuscule enwrapped viruses with ribonucleic acid genomes (all the genetic material in an organism),[1] of '9000–13,000 bases'.[2] Globally, dengue is the most prevalent vector-borne viral disease, affecting a projected 50–100 million populaces and with, on average 10,000 dengue-related mortality per year.[3] DENV has four serotypes: DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4.[4,5] The presentation of dengue fever is undifferentiated from other viral diseases, ranging from asymptomatic to severe forms.[6] The incubation period to express the symptoms is 4–10 days; however, asymptomatic cases are outnumbered.[7] The World Health Organization (WHO) has categorised dengue into (i) dengue having no warning signs, (ii) dengue having threatening signs and (iii) appalling dengue.[8] The critical warning signs and symptoms of dengue are pain in the abdomen, vomiting, fluid overload, mucosal bleeding manifestations such as epistaxis, gum bleeding, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, lethargy, restlessness, enlarged liver of >2 cm, increased haematocrit and reduced platelet.[9-11] In severe dengue, there is severe plasma leakage with shock and fluid accumulating respiratory problems, severe haemorrhage and organ failure.[12,13] Patients with a history of previous infection with DENV of different serotypes are at greater risk of transforming to severe secondary dengue.[14-16] According to the WHO, the fatality rate for severe dengue is 1% when diagnosed promptly and received proper therapeutic intervention.[17] One more study revealed that the death rate for grievous dengue was 3%–4% of all dengue viral infections and 2%–5% when adequately received medical intervention.[18] However, multiple studies reported that the death rate could increase up to 20%–50% if it remains untreated.[18,19] Simultaneous coinfection with other microorganisms intensifies the disease and can result in the patient's death, especially in paediatric cases with multiple organ failure.[20-23] Virological tests make diagnosis of dengue, specifically real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, dengue immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibody test by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the non-structural protein-1 ELISA-based antigen assay.[24-28] Treatment of dengue mainly involves giving supportive care to the patient.[29,30] However, intravenous fluid and electrolyte resuscitation are vital in severe cases of plasma leakage.[31,32] FACTORS AFFECTING THE VIRUS TRANSMISSION DENV transmission to humans is mainly through mosquito bites of infected female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes [Figure 1].[33] This mosquito lives primarily in tropical and subtropical temperate countries.[34] The larva stages of the mosquitoes are found in water-filled areas such as artificial water containers at or near human residences and mostly indoor water collections.[35,36] Virus transmission depends on environmental and climate factors, host–pathogen interactions and immunity.[37,38] The DENV transmission is favoured by rapid urbanisation and increased human population movement.[39,40]Figure 1: The transmission of dengue from mosquito to human.

Image credit: Susmita Sinha.Moreover, globalisation, global warming, climatic change and environmental deterioration, including social and human behavioural factors, facilitate the transmission of viruses and circulate to new geographical areas [Figure 2].[41] Low-and-middle-income countries having rapid urbanisation with dense residents, poor quality of health services and climatic suitability for vector growth favour dengue transmission.[42] The higher number of international travellers worldwide expedites the transmission of the viruses to newer places.[43]Figure 2: The factors affecting the dengue virus transmission.

Image credit: Susmita Sinha.EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DENGUE FEVER Dengue has posed a significant public health problem globally over the last 10 years through its emergence and re-emergence.[44,45] About 50% of the global population is at risk of contracting dengue fever.[46] A 30-fold upsurge in dengue infection has been reported during the last 50 years, including new places worldwide in urban and rural locales.[17,47] One model estimation reported 390 million cases of dengue fever globally,[5,48] and around 22,000 deaths/year.[49-51]Circa 40%–50% of the global population (2.5 billion) reside in dengue-endemic areas.[7,52,53] Dengue endemicity encompasses over 100–128 countries around the globe, especially in South-east Asia (SEA), Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, Africa and America, with an estimated 390 million new cases annually.[5,52,54] The dengue burden in Asia, Africa and America is 70%, 16% and 14%, respectively.[49] Globally, dengue infection rose by 85.47% from 30.67 to 56.88 million from 1990 to 2019.[45] Dengue spreads to new countries such as Italy, France, Croatia, Austria, Spain, Slovakia, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, Poland, the USA, Afghanistan, Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burkina Faso and Angola.[55-57] CURRENT GLOBAL DENGUE STATUS It is reported that from 2023 to November, more than 4.5 million dengue infections and more than 4000 deaths due to dengue took place in 80 countries across the globe.[58] South and SEA countries have suffered more than other regions.[54,59] In SEA and the Western Pacific Region, around 1.8 billion people are at risk of dengue, almost 75% of the worldwide dengue burden.[7,60] In the SEA, 1.3 billion people reside in 10 countries with dengue endemic.[61] Statistics from 2015 to 2019 showed a 46% increment (from 451,442 to 658,301) in dengue cases and a 2% decrease in mortality (from 1584 to 1555) in these countries.[61] One study on global dengue infection between 1990 and 2019 reported a growth rate of 269.06%, 72.95% and 57.65% in East Asia, South Asia and SEA, respectively.[45] In South Asia, the countries endemic for dengue are Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives.[62] The East Asian countries of China, Japan and Korea and SEA countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines suffer the most.[45,63-65] Almost 60% of all global dengue cases occur in India and China.[45] In 2023, Bangladesh faced an unusual dengue outbreak in 5 years, with a considerable increase in hospitalisation rate.[42,66,67] 296,665 positive dengue cases, including 1520 deaths, were reported from 1 January 2023 till 15 November 2023, with a case fatality ratio of 0.5%.[68] The highest number of monthly dengue infections (79,598 cases) and deaths (396 deaths) took place in September 2023.[60,68] Thailand has reported 119,465 cases with 122 deaths from January 2023 to 25 October 2023, which is higher than previous years' reports of 2018–2022.[60] In Nepal, from January to October 2023, 42,270 cases of dengue, including 20 confirmed deaths [Case fatality rate (CFR)=0.05%], were reported.[60] Sri Lanka reported 66,476 dengue cases until October 2023, 1.1 times higher than the 61,492 cases reported until week 42 in 2022.[60] Maldives reported 2707 cases from January to September 2023, 75% higher than in 2022 (1548 cases for the same period).[60] In India, till 17 September 2023, 94,198 patients and 91 deaths were reported.[69] Malaysia reports a 103% increment in dengue cases in 2023 compared to 2022. Statistics showed that by 26 October 2023, the total reported cases were 94,181, compared to 47,686 for the same period in 2022, and the number of death cases was 67, compared to 28 for the same period in 2022.[70] Cambodia reports 23,940 cases with 39 deaths till October 2023 compared to 8293 cases and 15 deaths for the same period in 2022.[70] However, Singapore, the Philippines and Vietnam have reported a decrease in dengue cases compared to the previous year. Singapore reports 7885 cases till 15 October 2023 compared to 28,882 cases for the same period in 2022. The Philippines reports 149,129 cases till 7 October 2023, compared to 216,475, which is 31% lower. Vietnam says 113,962 cases till 15 October 2023 compared to 264,078 cases for the same period in 2022, which is a decrease of 56.8%.[70] Although dengue endemicity is not seen in mainland Europe, still dengue cases are demonstrated as sporadic events since 2010 through infected travellers. Viremic travellers from endemic countries cause these autochthonous outbreaks, mainly in four European countries: Croatia, France, Italy and Spain.[71] In 2023, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported dengue cases in France and Italy as 43 and 76 cases, respectively, from July to October 2023, while in Spain, there were only three cases from August to October 2023.[72] The most endemic regions in America are South America, Central America and the Caribbean. Since the beginning of 2023, a significant outbreak has been reported in the WHO Region of America. Most of the dengue cases in 2023 were found in Brazil, Peru and Bolivia.[73] The total number of cases in America accounts for 3,708,524, including 6124 severe cases with 1796 deaths till October 2023. The highest number of dengue infections took place in the Southern Cone (2,700,916), Andean sub-region (518,605) and Central America (445,980). At the same time, Latin Caribbean, non-Latin Caribbean and North America have reported 14536, 21409 and 944 cases, respectively. The dengue incidence rate in 2023 increased to 582.14/100,000 from 211.99/100,000 in 2009.[74] In Africa, dengue intimidates health equally[57] of financial and workforce liabilities in public health services.[75] Dengue is found to be endemic in 34 African countries.[57,76,77] The Ministry of Public Health and Prevention in Chad, on 15 August 2023, declared a dengue viral fever epidemic had started. There were 1342 and 41 probable and laboratory cases, respectively, by 1 October 2023. One verified case of a dengue patient passed away.[78] Ethiopia reported a dengue outbreak in 2023. Statistics showed that till 10 May 2023, there were 1638, 103 and 9 suspected, confirmed cases and deaths, respectively. The case-fatality ratio is 0.5%.[79] In Mauritius, the dengue outbreak started in June 2023, and 147 cases were reported as of 7 July 2023. The Ivory Coast officially reported the dengue outbreak of 107 cases between 19 June 2023 and 25 June 2023. Twenty-two patients were confirmed by rapid diagnostic tests and RT-PCR and had no mortality.[79] STRATEGY FOR PREVENTION OF DENGUE The most promising dengue prevention and control method is an effective vector control measure for the DENV.[5] The best preventive measures to control dengue are eliminating mosquito breeding areas by spraying insecticide, cleaning, draining stagnant water outside the house and storing household water. The risk factors are the breeding areas, such as static water collections near hospitals, construction sites or densely populated human habitation. They should be emphasised more in addition to all other breeding areas.[66,80] The mosquitoes are usually more active and bite during the daytime, mostly at dusk and dawn. Awareness of the population about this timing is necessary to take measures to prevent biting. Using mosquito repellents on the skin surface and wearing full-sleeved shirts and long pants help control mosquito bites.[81] The use of bed nets, preferably insecticide-treated during sleeping, mainly by the affected person, is an effective method to prevent mosquito bites.[66,82] It is suggested that installing long-lasting insecticidal net curtains draped at mosquito entry points, such as doors and windows, can decrease adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes significantly. However, care must be taken to keep the curtains hung.[83] Population awareness is necessary to control dengue outbreaks.[18] Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent and restrain the global dengue landscape.[84] An increase in dengue cases has been reported in recent years worldwide, causing a life-threatening burden to people. Awareness and prevention control measures are crucial for the control of dengue outbreaks.

N2  - Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria are the bacteria which subsist inside and outside of the plant tissue and promote plant growth through direct or indirect mechanisms. To increase sorghum production and productivity we utilize herbicides and chemical fertilizers to overcome sorghum production constraints, but those chemicals have negative side effects. The current study was conducted with the objective of isolation of PGPR from sorghum rhizosphere and screening for primary growth related trait, evaluation of potential PGPR at greenhouse for sorghum growth performance and identify through biochemical characterization. So that, in this study a total of 117 plant growth promoting rhizobacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere of 12 sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) genotype by cultivating using 3 collected soil samples from the northern part of Ethiopia (Amhara and Tigray regional states) in greenhouse. Isolated bacteria were screened for primary growth promoting traits such as phosphate solubilization test, IAA production test at different concentration of L-tryptophan and ammonia production test. From the isolated bacteria 28% solubilized Phosphorous, 78% produced IAA at different concentration of tryptophan. The greatest IAA production was scored at 100 mg/L of tryptophan and the lowest production of IAA was scored at 150 mg/L of tryptophan, 69% of isolated bacteria produced ammonia. Hence, 15% of isolated bacteria fulfilled the above primary screening test and used for further greenhouse evaluation. Accordingly, eighteen bacteria were tested for greenhouse experiment using completely randomized design and all 18 isolates were significantly increased all the agronomic parameter as compared to the control such as plant shoot height, plant shoot fresh and dry weight, root length, root fresh and dry weight at p &lt; 0.01 and P ≤ 0.001. Two isolates G6E29 and G4E19 had significantly increased all the parameter but two isolates (G12E19 and G3E40) were statistically non-significant for root fresh weight compared to the control. These 18 potential isolates were characterized morphologically and biochemically. Eight isolates were grouped at Pseudomonas genera. Six isolates were grouped at Azotobacter and the rest four isolates were grouped at Bacillus genera. Thus, the use of plant growth promoting rhizosphere bacteria could be useful to improve sorghum production and productivity. However, further molecular identification and evaluation of the isolates exhibiting multiple plant growths promoting traits on plant-microbe interaction for economic crop of Ethiopia is needed to uncover their efficacy as effective plant growth promoting rhizosphere bacteria.

N2  - Abstract Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are chlorinated hydrocarbons extensively used for agriculture pest control and mosquito control from 1940s to 1960s. The use of OCPs for agricultural purpose was banned in many countries including Ethiopia. However, studies show that small scale farm holders in the central rift valley of Ethiopia use cocktail of pesticides including banned OCPs. This study was intended to detect the status of (OCP) residues in Ziway Lake, Oromia region of Ethiopia. For this study three commercially important fish species, sediment and succulent grass samples were randomly collected in replicate. The samples were extracted using USEPA (354 °C) method and the analysis was done using USEPA (8081) method. The health risk assessment was calculated based on USEPA (1996) guidelines while the data analysis was done using SAS 93.2 statistical software. The Laboratory result revealed that Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) metabolites, (PP'DDT and PP'DDE) were detected in all the three sample types. Accordingly, mean concentration of PP'DDT and PP'DDE detected in the three sample types were, 52.08 and 4.67 ng/g in succulent grass, 46.84 and 0.93 ng/g in sediment and 19.83 and 11.17 ng/g in fish samples. Among the three fish species tested, the maximum DDT metabolite residue detected was in Ciprinu scarpio fish spices (35.65 ng/g) while the minimum was in Carassius carassius fish spices (27.05 ng/g). People who regularly consume fish from the lake above estimated mean Ethiopian daily consumption (0.027 kg day-1), level are exposed to DDT while that those consume all species of fish from Lake below estimated mean , does not exposed to health problem . However, the low PP'DDE /PP'DDT ratio in sediment and succulent grass sample indicates that there is a recent pollution of the lake by DDT. Thus, Eco-system clearance from obsolete pesticides and control of illegal band organochlorine pesticide movement has to be given due attention.

N2  - Abstract The extensive use of pesticides considered as a global threat to the ecological integrity of aquatic ecosystems. Most developing countries including Ethiopia are burdened with these toxic and persistent pesticides due to their wider used for agricultural pest and malaria control. The present study was aimed to investigate the concentration of Organochlorine pesticides water, sediment and fish samples in Lakes Tana and Hayqe. Eight samples of each water and sediment and five fish samples were collected. A laboratory based cross sectional study was conducted from Dec 2020 to March 2021 in Lakes Tana and Hayqe. A more sensitive method for the determination of 18 Organochlorine pesticides in water, sediments, and fish samples were adopted using QuEChERS and the analyses were done using GC-MS. Water samples were processed using a liquid–liquid extraction technique and gas chromatograph equipped with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Dispersive-solid-phase extraction (d-SPE) was used for fish and sediment samples followed by cleanup and gas chromatograph Mass Spectroscopy. In the method validation, Percent of recovery ranged from 88.4-107.6%. From the result lindane (1.11 µg/L) was recorded the lowest concentration of OCPs in water samples and total endosulfan was the highest (14.97µg/L). In sediment samples, deltamethrin (11.21 µg/kg) was the lowest and endrin (70.42 µg/kg) was the highest OCPs. From fish samples, lindane (12.63 µg/kg) was the lowest and total endosulfan (68.78 µg/kg) was the highest concentration. The ANOVA test and t-test also depicted that the levels of most pesticides were significantly varied with different sampling sites and between Lakes.

N2  - The study was conducted to identify determinants of losses during pre-harvest and postharvest activities of fruits and their extent at producer`s level in Northwestern Ethiopia where tomato, papaya, avocado, banana and mango were used as fruit samples. Questionnaires were used to collect data from 180 randomly selected respondents of six districts (FinoteSelam, BurieZuria, Bahir Dar, Bahir Dar Zuria, Dangla and Farta). Descriptive statistics and multiple regressions analysis were used to identify determinant factors. The results of the findings revealed that the total fruit loss was estimated to be 44.8% where about 20.7% of the fruits were lost due to improper activities in the pre-harvest stages while about 24.1% loss was due to improper activities during post-harvest stages. The shares of pre-harvest and postharvest losses to the total fruit loss were about 46.2% and 53.8%, respectively. Income sources, use of pesticide, and use of compost or manure during production were the determinant factors that influenced fruit losses during pre-harvest while experience and educational levels of producers in fruit production and shortage of labor were the determinant factors of fruit losses during harvesting. Moreover, chemical treatments of fruits before storage and educational levels of the producers were the determinants that influenced fruit losses in producer`s storage while experiences of the fruit producers, distance to market and educational levels were the significant factors of fruit losses during marketing. Further researches and trainings of producers about use of pre- and post-harvest technologies that minimize losses at the value chain of fruits are vital.

N2  - The study was undertaken to examine the determinants of gender difference in soybean production among male and female headed soybean producer households at Bambasi District, Benishangul Gumuz Regional State, Ethiopia. Multi stage, sampling procedure was used to select sample respondents. In the district, ten kebeles were selected purposively according to the intensity of soybean production. Out of ten kebeles, five kebeles were selected by simple random sampling technique. Based on the list of the beneficiaries, households were selected using probabilities proportional to sample size procedure. A total of 136 households of soybean producer farmers (78 Male headed household (MHH) and 58 Female headed household (FHH)) were selected; and data was collected using semi structured questionnaire, interview and focus group discussion. Descriptive statistics, Ordinary Least Square Regression were used for the analysis of the data. The analysis of the data showed that 34.62% male headed and 67.24% female headed households were illiterate. The average land owned by MHH and FHH was 2.28 ha and 1.83 ha respectively, and the total of 58.97% MHH and 32.76% FHH had got credit service. As far as input utilization the majority of the respondents (56.41, 75.64% MHH and 72.41, 82.76% FHH) did not used fertilizer and pesticides, respectively. OLS estimation revealed that education of household head, household labour force, cultivated land size, tropical livestock unit, access to credit, frequency of extension contact, fertilizer application, hired labour, membership in social organization significantly affected the production of soybean in both men and female headed households; while pesticide application significantly affected MHH only. The study revealed men headed households have got higher production of soybean by utilizing the accessible input than FHH. Hence, similarly FHH should be encouraged and supported to access inputs for improving soybean productivity, and to increase the level of food security in the area.

N2  - Farming in Ethiopia can offer assistance in bringing dejected needs. Hence, the best possible means of achieving growth is by increasing the production efficiency of farmers. To estimate the levels of production efficiency, this study specifically used only data from farmers who are producing without plowing by oxen and without using fertilizers in the study area under shifting cultivation. Method: To determine the determinants of production efficiency, the Tobit model was used in this study. Result. The Tobit model results show that age of household, and herbicide use had a negative impact on the production efficiency of farmers. Regarding the positive determinants of production efficiency, labor, seed, and fertilizer (NPS) have a positive influence. Conclusion and Recommendation: The farmers in the study area are efficient in the production of maize. The government should give due attention to farmers' training by strengthening farmers' education and farmer training centers to make farmers more efficient producers and profitable by integrating local and traditional knowledge of farmers with formal knowledge of using herbicides. Farmers should also be advised, as they are youngest farmers engaging in farming work. Otherwise, the government should supply fertilizer and improve seed on credit.

N2  - <title>Abstract</title> Adapting to climate variability is crucial for sustainable livelihoods in developing countries like Ethiopia, where rain-fed agriculture underpins the economy. This study aims to evaluate both indigenous and introduced adaptation measures across different agroecological zones, along with their determining factors. Data was collected from 338 farm households using structured and semi-structured questionnaires. The Weighted Average Index (WAI) was used to identify the most significant adaptation methods employed by farm households in various agroecological zones, while the Problem Confrontation Index (PCI) assessed the barriers hindering the implementation of these strategies. The multinomial logit model (MNL) was utilized to investigate the factors affecting farmers' choices of adaptation strategies. The results indicated that the most popular indigenous adaptation strategies were planting local crop varieties (WAI = 2.22), crop diversification (WAI = 2.15), and adjusting planting dates (WAI = 2.14). The introduced adaptation strategies included using inorganic fertilizers (WAI = 2.64), applying improved crop varieties (WAI = 2.41), and using pesticides and herbicides (WAI = 2.24). PCI results revealed that the major barriers to adapting to climate variability were limited farm size (PCI = 694), lack of access to climate information (PCI = 641), poor soil quality (PCI = 639), lack of irrigation facilities (PCI = 623), and high input costs (PCI = 610). The logit model identified several significant factors influencing farmers' preferences for adaptation measures, such as crop failure, credit availability, recurrent drought, climate variability perception, agroecological location, and household income. The study underscores the importance of understanding local-level factors that influence farmers' adaptation strategies to enhance their resilience to climate variability.

N2  - There is high wheat yield variation among smallholders in the study area. The yield gap is mainly due to socio-economic, farm inputs utilization and institutional service characteristics of the farmers. This study identifies the determinant factors that affect the probability of wheat yield tends to be relatively low, medium or high given a set of yield influencing factors. Cross-sectional data collected from randomly selected farm households and ordered logistic regression were used to attain the objective of the study. The study found out that seed rate, rates of herbicides and fungicides applications, use of hand weeding and agro-ecological location of household were significant factors that determine the probability of wheat yield level to be low, medium or high. The findings imply that agro-ecology based seed rate, weed and disease management efforts are needed to improve wheat yield provided that the recommended rates of seed, herbicides and fungicides are properly applied.Keywords: Wheat, Determinants for yield variation, Ordered logit, Ethiopia

N2  - The ever growing saline lake Beseka is located at the northern end of Main Ethiopia Rift; MER. The levels of some selected heavy metals (Pb, Cr, Cd, Fe, As and Mn) were determined in water sample collected from 5 sites of the ever growing Lake Beseka by systematic random sampling methods and analyzed spectrophotometrically for its suitability for drinking, irrigation and other domestic purpose. The results of the heavy metals concentration revealed the following: Pb (0.434-0.916 mg/L), Cd (0.031-0.103 mg/L), As (0.043-0.067 mg/L), Fe (0.163-0.247 mg/L) Cr (BDL) and Mn (0.061-0.092 mg/L). The result obtained revealed that the heavy metals show variation among sampling points. Pb, Cd, As and Fe recorded concentrations above the WHO guideline limits of 0.02, 0.003, 0.01 and 0.04 mg/L, respectively but they are below the ANZECC and ARMCANZ standard guide line limit for irrigation A and Cr were below their respective detection limits. The main causes of deterioration of water quality are disposal of effluent from municipal of MER, agrochemical runoff and effluent discharged from industries without treatment. The results suggest that the use of such waters for drinking and domestic purposes pose a serious threat to the health of the users and calls for the intervention of government agencies.

N2  - Garlic (Allium sativum L.) is one of the major allium crops grown in the highlands of Bale, south eastern Ethiopia. Rust, which is caused by Puccinia allii Rudolphi is the most important disease of this crop in these areas. There are different fungicides recommended for the control of garlic rust on <i>Allium</i> crops in different parts of the world. Nativo SC 300 (Trifloxystrobin 100g/l + Tebuconazole 200g/l) is one of the recommended chemicals for the control of this disease. To determine the optimum Nativo SC 300 spray frequency for the control of the disease a study was conducted at research station of Sinana Agricultural Research Center, south eastern Ethiopia. The fungicide was sprayed on garlic plots in three different frequencies. The frequencies were five times (every 7-days), three times (every 14-days) and two times (every 21-days) starting from the onset of the disease. The experiment was laid down in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications. The lowest average rust severity level (1%) was recorded from plots which were treated with the fungicide five times at weekly interval whereas the maximum average severity level (83.3%) was recorded from the unsprayed plots. All fungicide treated plots gave significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher total bulb yield than the untreated check plots. Among fungicide treated plots, the maximum total bulb yield (13.92 t/ha) was obtained from plots which were protected from the disease by spraying the fungicide three times at 14-days interval. Partial budget analysis revealed that application of Nativo SC 300 three times at 14-days interval gave the highest net benefit. Therefore, application of Nativo SC 300 (Trifloxystrobin 100g/l + Tebuconazole 200g/l) three times at 14-days interval starting from the onset of the disease results in not only high total bulb yield but also high net benefit on the chemical application.

N2  - Honeybees (<i>Apis mellifera L</i>.) play an important ecological and economic role in the pollination service of crops. Pesticide residues in honey can happen when bees in search nectar and pollen, visit crops that have been treated with various agrochemicals for different reasons. The presence of pollutants in honey can influence honeybee colony performance and devalue its use for human consumption. The aims of this study were to determine pesticide residue levels in honey samples from East Shewa and West Arsi zone and to identify type of pesticides present in honey samples. A total of 24 honey samples were collected from apiaries different localities just after harvesting. Honey samples were analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Among different pesticides analyzed in honey samples, Chlorpyrifos was the most frequently detected (16.7%) followed by Endosulfan sulphate (12.5%) and Profenofos (8.3%). The average recoveries of pesticides ranged between 72% and 102.4%, with relative standard deviation less than 20%. All the pesticide residues detected were very low and below their respective maximum residue limits set by the European Union. Hence, pesticide residues in honey samples analyzed do not pose any health risk to consumers. Although the study results showed none significant pesticide residue in the analyzed honey samples, a special precaution should be taken regarding to production of pesticides, their sale, and application in the future.

N2  - Tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera:Gelechiidae) is an important pest of tomato crops native to South America. It is considered to be one of the major pests of tomato crop in Ethiopia since 2012. The aim of this study was to determine the economic threshold level of T. absoluta under glasshouse conditions. The damage potential and economic threshold level for T. absoluta larvae on tomato crop were studied during 2015 to 2016 under glasshouse conditions. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) differences were observed among the treatments during the study period. The number of larvae per plant reduced the yield to the extent of 10.51 to 75.62% during 2015, and 11.87 to 80.22% during 2016 cropping season. The mean values of marketable yield gained to the cost of insecticide application at 0, 1 and 4 larvae per plant were 34,913, 31,006 and 16,574.5 kg/ha from 2015 to 2016, respectively. The lowest yield was observed at control/unsprayed treatment (7,751.5 kg/ha). The economic injury level (EIL) lies at the pest population density where Benefit-Cost ratio would be 1.08. From this study, the ElL of T. absoluta was determined as 3.0 larvae per plant based on the findings of glasshouse experiments conducted over the period of two years. The economic threshold level (ETL) was worked out at 2.25 larvae per plant during the same years under glasshouse conditions.&nbsp; &nbsp; Key words: Economic, infestation, injury, larva, management, threshold, tomato, Tuta absoluta, yield.

N2  - Khat (<i>Catha edulis forsk</i>), a plant used as a stimulant is grown in certain areas of East Africa and the Arab Peninsula. In Ethiopia, it is cultivated in most parts of the country and distributed to local consumers and in other countries. Many farmers have adopted modern farming methods such as application of fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation for Khat cultivation. These agricultural practices are known to increase the concentration of heavy metals in soil and khat. Some of these heavy metals such as Pb and Cd are toxic even at low concentrations while Zn, Cu, Fe and Cr though essential in the body, are toxic at high levels. Therefore this study determined the levels of Zn, Cu, Fe, Pb, Cd and Cr in khat where the plant is grown. Three different types of Khat samples grown in Gidolle, Konso and Koyira were collected from the growing area.0.5 g of oven dried Khat samples were digested by wet digestion using 3 mL of HNO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mL of HClO<sub>4</sub> and 1 mL of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by setting the temperature first to 60°C for 30 min and then increased to 210°C for the next 2 h and 30 min.. The digests were analyzed for selected heavy metals using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The following concentration ranges in dry weight (μg/g) were obtained in khat: Fe (180-222), Zn (25.23-33.69), Cu (12.64-15.74), Cr (4.01-4.53). The toxic metals (Pb and Cd) were not detected in all the samples analyzed. The ANOVA results suggested that there was significant difference (p<0.05) in the levels of heavy metals between khat varieties. Levels of studied heavy metals in khat were within in the range of maximum recommended RDA value. Based on this study the analyzed khat are free from toxic heavy metals and do not pose a health risk rather it is a source of essential nutrients for the chewers.

N2  - <title>Abstract</title> The rotational use of insecticides with diverse modes of action in indoor residual spraying (IRS) is pivotal for enhancing malaria vector control and addressing insecticide resistance. A key factor in national malaria vector control programs is the rate the rate at which these insecticide’s decays. VECTRON™ T500, with broflanilide as its active ingredient, is a recently developed candidate insecticide formulation that has shown promising results in certain phase II experimental hut trials. However, its residual efficacy across different settings has not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of VECTRON™ T500 on various wall surfaces (mud, dung, paint, and cement) and assess its decay rates over time in Ethiopia. Insectary-reared <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic> Sekoru strain mosquitoes were used to evaluate the residual efficacy of VECTRON™ T500. Female mosquitoes, aged two to three days were used for the bioassays. Seven 'tukul' type test huts, each hut with a distinct wall type (mud, dung, painted, and cemented) were used for the study. Three huts received VECTRON™ T500; three huts were sprayed with Actellic 300CS, and one hut served as a negative control (sprayed with water only). The results showed that VECTRON™ T500 demonstrated remarkable efficacy, inducing over 80% mortality in mosquitoes across all wall surface types throughout the nine-month study period. In contrast, Actellic® 300CS achieved over 80% mortality for six months, except on dung wall surfaces, after which its efficacy declined sharply below 80%. Overall, the mortality rates achieved with VECTRON™ T500 were non-inferior to Actellic® 300CS and extended up to nine months across all treated wall surface types, outperforming Actellic® 300CS. This makes VECTRON™ T500 a promising candidate insecticide formulation for use in IRS in malaria-endemic countries such as Ethiopia.

N2  - The most important role that agriculture plays in a country's political, economic and social stability makes degree of agricultural productions seriously sensitive. Agricultural production patterns vary markedly over Ethiopia according to agro-climatic conditions, in specific, broadly varying rainfall and elevation. To increase the cultivation process and improve agricultural productivity it is also require knowledge-based recommender system for crop selection, in order to advice how the farmers and experts select the crop type by considering soil texture, soil PH value, temperature, average rainfall, and other factors. Knowledge-based systems are a branch of artificial intelligence which is a computer program that attempts to replicate the reasoning processes of a human expert. It can make decisions and recommendations and perform tasks based on user input. The expert`s knowledge is accessible when the human expert might not be and so that the knowledge can be accessible at all times and in numerous places, as necessary. Cultivators (farmers) need advance or specialist knowledge to take decision during soil preparation, seed selection, fertilizer management, pesticide management, water planning, weed management etc., so that to get high yield. In Ethiopia Current cereal yields are low, by international standards, indicating growth potential, since of lack of advanced agriculture experts and shortage of agriculture facilities. In the efforts to address such problems, it is important to develop Knowledge-based system recommender system that can provide advice for farmers and agriculture professionals to facilitate crop selection process to become more productive. In this study, a prototype knowledge-based system (KBS) recommender system for crop selection is proposed. So, in order to develop the proposed recommender system an implicit and explicit knowledge used and acquired through interview, document analysis respectively. The data were collected from Gondar Agricultural Research Center which is found in Ethiopia. Knowledge Engineering research design was employed to develop the system. The prototype system reaches a good performance and meets the goals of the study.

N2  - Microbial control has recently been recognized as an important component of integrated pest management strategies for field crops and stored product commodities. The successful development of a mycoinsecticide ultimately depends on the availability of a virulent strain, an optimized and economic production system and a suitable formulation to optimise its application, efficacy and storage characteristics as well as the persistence after application. It is clear from analysis and synthesis of the present studies that considerable efforts have been made towards the selection of virulent isolates, the optimisation of the production process, the development of new formulations and testing their efficacy against the intended target insect pests, their persistence and storability under different environmental conditions. Accordingly, it was made possible to use BCAs for two distinct groups of agriculturally important insect pests, namely, field pests and storage insect pests. The field pest group was represented by locusts and grasshoppers (Locusta migratoria, Hieroglyphus daganensis and Cryptocatantops haemorrhoidalis), whereas the storage insect pests were represented by Sitophilus zeamais and Prostephanus truncatus. Due to the diverse nature of the test insects and their habitat, the methods followed to develop appropriate formulations are different for the two groups, for which the major findings are summarized as follows.The production and processing study indicates that submerged conidia of M. anisopliae var. acridum (IMI 330189) can be mass produced in a BH medium (3% biomalt and 1% yeast extract) under specific culturing conditions. Moreover, submerged conidia of M. anisopliae var. acridum (IMI 330189) can be effectively dried using the additives skimmed milk powder, molasses or glycerol either by freeze-drying or spray-drying technique. Storage at low temperatures (< 10°C) is possible for over 11 months without significant loss in viability. The initial viability of spores remains higher for spray-dried submerged spores. Furthermore, the viability and the efficacy of freeze-dried submerged conidia are significantly reduced when the product was ground to fine powder through a 120 µm mesh.When aerial conidia, submerged spores (mostly blastospores) and submerged conidia of M. anisopliae var. acridum (IMI 330189) were tested in different formulations in the laboratory and under field conditions, aerial conidia formulated in diesel oil displayed a higher efficacy against L. migratoria, H. daganensis and C. haemorrhoidalis at a lower application rate of 5 x 1012 conidia ha-1 than all submerged conidia and submerged spore formulations, which were applied at 1 x 1013 conidia ha-1. Freeze or spray dried submerged conidia of M. anisopliae var. acridum (IMI 330189) formulated in an oil flowable concentrate formulation are equally infectious to L. migratoria under laboratory conditions at a higher rate of 1 x 1013 spores ha-1.Submerged spores/conidia of M. anisopliae var. acridum (IMI 330189) were formulated as emulsions, as an oil flowable concentrate or as water-based formulations, out of which an oil flowable concentrate formulation revealed good biocontrol potential under laboratory and field conditions followed by emulsions. Under the conditions of the present research work and under the harsh environmental conditions that occur in the Sahel, water-based formulations of submerged spores are not suitable for grasshopper control using ULV applications. It was also observed that insects varied in their susceptibility to mycoinsecticide formulations, C. haemorrhoidalis being more susceptible to the mycopathogen than L. migratoria. Overall, the study provides evidence on the potential use of submerged conidia of M. anisopliae var. acridum under Sahelian environmental conditions. However, further improvements on the production process along with the quality of the formulation are indispensable.Strain selection according to thermal tolerance may be warranted when choosing an isolate for development as a microbial control agent. The results presented in this study confirm that there is a considerable variability in germination and growth at different temperatures among isolates of M. anisopliae, B. bassiana, B. brongniartii and Paecilomyces sp. The present study further demonstrated the susceptibility of S. zeamais and P. truncatus to non-specific entomopathogenic fungi indigenous to Ethiopia at varying degrees, P. truncatus being more susceptible to all isolates tested than S. zeamais. Furthermore, among the tested isolates, conidia and submerged spores/conidia of M. anisopliae (PPRC-EE) and B. bassiana (PPRC-HH,) appeared to be highly virulent to S. zeamais and P. truncatus. However, for the same isolates, the observed efficacy of submerged spores/conidia may or may not out way the aerial conidia and is entirely dependent on the type of liquid medium used for the production. The present study also identified one B. bassiana isolate (PPRC-HH), which produced an exceptionally higher yield of submerged conidia in TKI medium. Subsequently, M. anisopliae isolate (PPRC-EE) and B. bassiana isolate (PPRC-HH) were selected and various dustable powder (DP) formulations were developed and tested against stored product insect pests. The results revealed that all the tested formulations were active, (especially at higher concentration of 1 x 108 spores ml-1) when they were applied as a water suspension against S. zeamais. However, they show differences when they were incorporated on maize grains as a dry powder. Generally, DP formulations of aerial conidia were more effective against the two test insects than the corresponding submerged spore/conidia-based formulations. Moreover, aerial conidia-based formulations were more persistent, and could be stored 5 months at 4°C and 30°C than the corresponding submerged spore/conidia formulations. These storage characteristics could perfectly met under African conditions, where in most cases temperature in pesticide stores does not seem to exceed 30°C. Moreover, this study demonstrated that for dry powder formulations of submerged spores, a long term storage (up to 4 months) is possible at both 4°C and 30°C, however, a decline in viability and efficacy was observed at higher rates when the formulations were stored at 30°C for 5 months. This study also indicates the importance of inert carriers for improved efficacy, persistence and storability of DP formulations of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae spores.In general, the results of this study magnificently demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a successful level of control for S. zeamais and P. truncatus on stored and infested cereals using DP formulations of conidia of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae isolates. This would apparently be advantageous, especially in developing countries, where the risk of pesticide misuse is a major problem. Thus, the most effective formulations reported here could serve as a spring-board for further improvement of field application strategies. Furthermore, the fact that B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are easily amenable to large-scale production without a high input of technology essentially imply the feasibility of microbial control in the context of subsistence agriculture in developing countries such as Ethiopia. It can be inferred that developments being made now on the horizon would presumably make biological control of insect pests attractive from the practical point of view and also from an economic perspective in Ethiopia. This work could, therefore, be regarded as an important addition towards achieving this goal, as it would certainly shade-light to the sustainable development of more potent BCAs from the untapped beneficial microbial resources of the country.

N2  - Christian ethicists are relatively familiar with questions about the practical meaning of responsibility as it relates to consumption.Asking the question of responsibility might lead to lifestyle changes respect to food and clothing, whether or not to travel, whether to buy books electronically, renovating furniture rather than buying new, and such like.As a consumer, I could buy clothes only from shops such as Sancho's Dress in the city where I live.This small, independent clothing shop stocks clothing made from pesticide-and fertilizer-free cotton and traces all stock to ensure that fair wages are paid to workers.The owners raised £11,000 by crowd-funding to develop a small factory in Ethiopia to produce shawls, scarfs and ponchos.Co-founder of the business, Kalkidan, wrote in her blog entry 'Hand-Made: Why less is more?':Sometimes it can feel as an understatement to say that our scarves are 'hand-made', as they are in fact the result of a long and ancient chain of skilled hand-crafting.The cotton is of course hand-picked (for better or worse), then hand-spun into twine by an elderly community affected by leprosy before it is put into a wooden loom, which is of course pedal powered (by feet not hands) made from fast growing locally sourced wood before it is hand-woven and finally hand-wrapped by us before sending out into the world.We chose this process because we understand that the real value of things lie in the hands that they have passed and the lives that they have changed.A balance which can work for overall good or overall bad, as if they pass through the hands of low skilled low wage workers it can have a negative and impoverishing effect on individuals and their futures.We just wanted to let you know how powerful you are as a consumer and also to promise that we will keep things well made and quite small in order to do justice to the process of making and to be able to always measure the externalities we are creating. 11 Sancho's Dress Blog, July 8, 2015, accessed August 31, 2015,The externalities, or third-party effects such as environmental damage and human suffering, are minimized at every stage of production, processing, shipping and sale. 2Mobilizing consumers to take responsibility for such issues of global social justice is integral to their business plan and resonates positively with the rise of 'ethical' consumption in recent years that has created sizeable markets for fair trade goods in most developed countries.Living close to this shop, I am fortunate in being able to ask the shop owners, Kalkidan and Vidmantas, the names of the women who stitched the blouses and trousers.Most towns and cities now have similar shops that sell traceable cotton and wool goods, however.And it is increasingly common in the farming industry to boast proudly of fully traceable meat, 'farm to fork', for the best possible eating experience.Only a very few examples come to mind of consumer purchases more directly originating in the products of mining (mindful that the clothes made in Ethiopia and sold in the UK must be transported somehow and cattle are over-wintered in barns constructed from stainless steel, etc.).The Fairphone social enterprise company aims to develop smartphones that are designed and produced with minimal harm to people and the planet marks a step forward in this regard: 'We want to integrate materials in our supply chain that support local economies, not armed militias'. 3Its strapline 'the smartphone with social values' stimulates consumers to think about issues at every http://www.sanchosdress.com/blogs/news/34995972-hand-made-why-less-is-more

N2  - Vector borne diseases (VBDs) continue to sustain the huge burden of communicable diseases in Africa, as efficient indigenous and invasive vectors expand their range and abundance. Consequently, malaria, lymphatic filariasis, and arboviral diseases, such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika virus disease, Rift Valley fever and West Nile fever persist [[1]Alonso P.

Carvajal A. et al.Cemeteries in Miami-Dade County, Florida are important areas to be targeted in mosquito management and control efforts.PLoS ONE. 2020; 15e0230748https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. While global surveillance on apposite vectors of arboviruses, urban malaria and lymphatic filariasis has been extensive and encompassing cemeteries, efforts remain outstandingly less exhaustive in Africa. Ae. aegypti is the primary vector of arboviruses and the invasive Ae. albopictus is a secondary vector, both breed in artificial water-filled containers like tyres, cisterns, flowerpots, vases, bromeliads, discarded jars, metal drums and construction sites. Lymphatic filariasis is primarily transmitted by An. mosquito species in rural areas and by Cx. quinquefasciatus in urban and peri-urban areas. An. stephensi breeds in man-made water storage containers such as wells, roof gutters, cisterns, domestic wells and water tanks alongside Ae. Aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, both vectors of Rift Valley fever and West Nile fever [[2]Sinka M.E. Pironon S. Masseyc N.C. Longbottom J. Hemingway J. Moyes C.L. Willis K.J.

These vectors also have differences and similarities in their bionomics including biting behavior, whereas Ae. aegypti is a day biting species, An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus biting times range from crepuscular to nocturnal. An. stephensi is an established malaria vector in Asia and the Middle East, and responsible for urban malaria epidemics. The species has invaded countries in the Horn of Africa in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia. Consequently, in 2019 a WHO Technical consultation assessed the situation and a vector alert was produced to prompt action [[6]WHO. Vector Alert: anopheles stephensi invasion and spread. https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/26-08-2019-vector-alert-anopheles-stephensiinvasion-and-spread. Accessed 17 September 2020.Google Scholar]. Insecticide resistance has developed in An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus and threaten to compromise effective control of the peri‑domestic breeding and biting vectors [[7]Hemingway J.

Magill A. et al.Averting a malaria disaster: will insecticide resistance derail malaria control?.Lancet. 2016; 387: 1785-1788Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar]. Given that Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus have been characterized in cemeteries [[8]Vezzani D Review: artificial container-breeding mosquitoes and cemeteries: a perfect match.Trop Med Int Health. 2007; 12: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar], and data on An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus in African cemeteries is non-existent (Table 1), integration with current malaria surveillance and research is essential.Table 1Mosquito vector species breeding in water-filled artificial containers including vases, flowerpots, bromeliads, discarded jars and bottles and natural habitats like bamboo stumps and tree-holes within cemeteries and the notable gap of data for Africa.Mosquito vector speciesGeographic location/ RegionReferencesAmericasEuropeSouth East Asia/ PacificAfricaAedes (Stegomyia) aegypti+++–(2,8)Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus+++–(2,8)Ochlerotatus japonicas/Ochlerotatus triseriatus+++–(8,10)Culex quinquefasciatus+–+–(2,8)Culex pipiens complex+–+–(8)Culiseta incidens/ Cs. inornata+–––(8) Open table in a new tab Chikungunya, dengue, and Zika virus disease are devoid of specific treatment with challenging diagnoses, and candidate vaccines exists for chikungunya and Zika virus disease but licensed ones are not currently available.

Rodrigues L.C Zika, chikungunya and dengue: the causes and threats of new and re-emerging arboviral diseases.BMJ Glob Health. 2017; 3e000530Google Scholar], particularly Wolbachia, gene drives, sterile insect technique, vector traps, attractive toxic sugar baits and spatial repellents. While effectiveness of vector control is contingent on entomological and epidemiological evidence, transformation from reactive to proactive and sustainable strategies including integration of neglected areas is critical [[9]Paixão E.S. Teixeira M.G. Rodrigues L.C Zika, chikungunya and dengue: the causes and threats of new and re-emerging arboviral diseases.BMJ Glob Health. 2017; 3e000530Google Scholar]. Cemeteries are potentially significant foci for proliferation of Aedes and Culex mosquito vectors [[8]Vezzani D Review: artificial container-breeding mosquitoes and cemeteries: a perfect match.Trop Med Int Health. 2007; 12: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar], as demonstrated by entomological surveillance in Europe, the Americas, and South East Asia and the pacific, except in Africa (Table 1). Although regional and national policies, guidelines and frameworks on integrated management of arbovirus vectors have been formulated and promulgated with legislation enacted, cemeteries are still disproportionately disregarded in Africa. To eliminate VBDs in Africa, reinvigorated surveillance including integration of cemeteries as part of IVM will be indispensable. Harnessing salient bionomic and environmental attributes common to vectors for lymphatic filariasis, arboviruses and urban malaria would be critical to exploit the potential of IVM. Increasing urbanization provide ideal conditions for vectors and increases potential of community awareness and engagement [[2]Sinka M.E. Pironon S. Masseyc N.C. Longbottom J. Hemingway J. Moyes C.L. Willis K.J. A new malaria vector in Africa: predicting the expansion range of Anopheles stephensi and identifying the urban populations at risk.PNAS. 2020; : 1-9https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2003976117Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar]. Salient characteristics of breeding in water-filled flowerpots, vases, bromeliads, discarded jars, bottles and rainwater collection make Ae. aegypti, An. stephensi and Cx. quinquefasciatus presence in African urban cemeteries a plausible research postulate, and their sympatric-existence in water storage containers in peri‑domestic environments could optimize vector control [[2]Sinka M.E.

Aedes-transmitted Zoonoses potentiates improvement of multisectoral active surveillance within the One Health Approach. With increasing urbanization, built up environments have encroached on sprawling cemeteries in Africa. While the framework for implementation of the GVCR in Africa includes vector surveillance, research and innovation, there is a notable dearth of information on vector proliferation in cemeteries (Table 1). This disregard may result partly from the perception of cemeteries that connote enormous cultural and spiritual sensitivity [[10]Leisnham P.T. La Deau S.L. Juliano S.A Spatial and temporal habitat segregation of mosquitoes in urban Florida.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9:: e91655Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar]. Considering the threat of arboviral diseases and urban malaria epidemics, proactive entomological surveillance in cemeteries is eco-epidemiologically significant and vital for health security. Methodologies would encompass early detection and monitoring of mosquito vector species, ecological approaches to establish habitat preferences, and mosquito control studies to evaluate vector control tools [[8]Vezzani D Review: artificial container-breeding mosquitoes and cemeteries: a perfect match.Trop Med Int Health. 2007; 12: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar]. There is need to promote research in cemeteries to generate requisite evidence and to hearten strong collaboration among the health sector, local authorities and pertinent partners with vested interests. Other partners include the environment sector, academic and research institutions, policy makers, funders, vector control implementers and communities. EC declares no competing interests.

N2  - ABSTRACT This research was conducted to study the diversity of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) in the rhizosphere of different plants at the vicinity of Hawassa city, Southern Ethiopia. The rate of root colonisation and diversity of AMF in the rhizosphere soils of permanent crops, major annual crops, forest areas, and open grazing fields were investigated. It discovered 928 spores of 23 distinct AMF morpho-species in 12 AMF genera and 12 annual and perennial crops. The AMF genera identified were: Acaulospora, Cetraspora, Claroideoglomus, Dentiscutata, Diversispora, Funneliformis, Gigaspora, Glomus, Racocetra, Rhizophagus, Sclerocystis, and Scutellospora. In tomatoes grown inorganically, a compromised species richness may result from the extensive use of agrochemicals. Further research into the effects of agricultural inputs on the subsurface microbial population may be necessary, as this is outside the purview of this publication. When compared to all other land uses, the AMF beneath the rhizosphere soil of Eucalyptus trees has the largest biomass, with spore density of 1907.4±0.404 spores 100g-1 of dry soil. The lowest AMF biomass has been recorded in the rhizosphere soil of Mango tree, with spore density of 260.1±0.121 spores 100g -1 dry soil. The results of this study show that the mycorrhizal colonisation and spore density of the plants under investigation are decreased by monocropping, intense agricultural practises, and the application of inorganic fertilisers. Thus, it is thought that conservation agriculture, together with the development of plant species consortiums in agricultural polts, will preserve the biological diversity of Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and the integrity of the environment. Significance of the study to the field - plant species diversity is dependent on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi diversity and density - AMF Favours environmental resilience, carbon sequestration, and improves soil structure - Application of inorganic agricultural inputs decrease, AMF diversity - AMF diversity is affected by land use change, environmental pollution and climate change

N2  - Background: Sesame ( Sesamum indicum L; Pedaliaceae) is an important oilseed crop that contributes significantly to the Ethiopian economy through foreign exchange but it is heavily attacked by the sesame webworm which causes 83% yield loss. Objective: The aim was to evaluate efficacy of aqueous extracts of seven locally available bio-pesticides ( Azadirachta indica, Lantana camara, Rumex patientia , Nicotiana glauca , Ricinus communis, Phytolacca dodecandra and Tagetes minuta ) along with dimethoate 40% EC (standard test) and untreated control (only tap water) against sesame webworm ( Antigastra catalaunalis ) insect pest, and its effects on sesame yield and yield losses under outdoor conditions. Methods: Field experiment was conducted at Humera agricultural research center during the 2020 harvest season. Treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications and applied 3 times at 2-week intervals. Results: ANOVA results showed that all aqueous extracts were significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher than the control. Uninterrupted growth of the test insect resulted in an incidence of 82.59%. However, it was decreased to 28.89% and 29.63% by spraying A. indica and R. Communis aqueous extracts. A. indica was statistically equivalent to R. communis and dimethoate 40% EC in reducing damage to leaves (8.56%), flowers (10.20%), capsules (3.34%) and seeds (29.67%) yet significantly different from controls which scored 21.8%, 20.88%, 11.51%, and 79.34%, leaf, flower, capsule, and seed damage respectively. R. communis also effectively condensed injuries on leaves (8.68%), flowers (12.64%), capsules (2.66%) and seeds (23.42%). Likewise, aqueous solutions of A. indica showed impressive yields (0.71 t ha -1 ) followed by R. communis (0.53 t ha -1 ) compared with the control (0.22 t ha -1 ). Yield increase over control was also higher for A. indica (222.73%) and R. communis (140.91%) compared to other treatments. The maximum (69.01%) estimated yield loss was recorded in control plots due to webworm invasion in sesame. Conclusion: From this result, it can be concluded that A. indica and R. communis can be excellent substitutes for synthetic insecticides to increase sesame yield under outdoor conditions.

N2  - Abstract This paper explores the economic implications of fall armyworm (FAW) and its management strategies by exploiting exogenous variation in FAW exposure amongst households in southern Ethiopia. We find that FAW exposure affects maize yield and sales negatively, but not consumption. Furthermore, we find evidence of crowding-in and intensification of insecticide use in response to FAW exposure. We also find suggestive evidence that existing extension service arrangements lack the capacity to deal with emerging threats such as FAW. Results imply that targeted interventions aimed at improving the effectiveness of control measures and institutional capacity would be key to reduce the adverse effects of FAW. Highlights The economic impact of fall armyworm (FAW) in southern Ethiopia assessed Fall armyworm significantly reduces maize yields and maize sales A positive correlation observed between FAW exposure and intensity of insecticide use Existing individual FAW control strategies do not significantly abate losses from FAW Improving institutional capacity is essential to control FAW

N2  - Water hyacinth is one of invasive weed species which belongs to family Pontederiaceae which was characterized by a free floating perennial aquatic weed and one of the major challenging problems in water bodies of the tropics and sub-tropics. Therefore, the aim of this article is to identify the distribution,impacts and beneficial effects as well as the possible management practices of water hyacinth.Water hyacinth was introduced in the water bodies of the Rift Valley in 68 years ago and currently, the weed is distributed Lake Tana, Lake Abaya, Lake Koka, Koka Dam in Ethiopia.The weed affected water resources, fisheries, transportation and social structure.The wide distribution and abundance of water hyacinth has led to decreased water availability and sustainable water biodiversity in Ethiopian lakes. However, the spread of water hyacinth is threatening not only water bodies but also socioeconomic development and human health. Water hyacinth in water bodies and nearby areas of local stakeholder has negative impact on environment and also impact on aquatics biodiversity.In contrast to these,Water hyacinth is rich sources of different nutrients that provides feed for animals such as ruminants, Rabbits, Ducks, Geese, Pigs and Fish.Water hyacinth can be controlled by mechanically by machine or manual which was environmentally safe as compared to other methods. Physical control includes automatic mowers and dredgers.Biological method by using bioagents weevils which involves long term strategy and chemical involves by using herbicides 2,4 - D, Diquat and Glyphosate that can be implemented by accomplished operator.Therefore, sustainable long term management strategies should include prevention in newly infested areas. in low infested areas, integrated use of herbicides has to be developed. To contain the further spread and buildup of this weed for future infestation, these weeds should be utilized for composting and feed purposes. Besides,extensive mass awareness and community campaign especially to uproot should be implemented. Therefore, it can be summarized that human intervention is considered as the current problem of water resource in the country and further study is needed to sustain the water resource to keep water hyacinth at economic thresh hold level.

N2  - Bright spots are, by definition, cases where local food production has been improved primarily through resource-conserving agricultural techniques, which inlude: integrated pest management, integrated nutrient management, conservation tillage, agroforestry, aquaculture, water harvesting and livestock integration into farming systems. This paper provides a summary of the results of the analyses of global bright spots by Pretty et al. [See Environmental Science and Technology (2006) 40 (4), 1114-1119]. These analyses focused on: (1) water productivity as a case of local resource use efficiency; (2) pesticide use as an external input factor with direct relevance to human health and environment; and (3) carbon sequestration giving rise to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions as an example of a global ecosystem benefit. An expanded view of the variety of ecosystem benefits (soil quality, water productivity, low external inputs, integrated pest management, water cycling, biodiversity, carbon sequestration and social capital) that are possible from bright spot cases based on resource-conserving agricultural practices is also provided. The benefits are illustrated through descriptive case study examples in China, Uzbekistan, Ethiopia, Ghana, Brazil, India, Honduras and Thailand, and a qualitative assessment of their ecosystem benefits.

N2  - This editorial summarises new developments in the Public Health research topic"Health Promotion in Schools, Universities, Workplaces, and Communities", which areplaces and social contexts where people engage in daily activities and in whichenvironmental, policy, organisational, and individual factors interact to affect healthand well-being. This research topic was very appealing as 105 manuscripts weresubmitted, and, following a rigorous evaluation and improvements suggested by high level reviewers, 44 (41,9%) papers were accepted for publication. Of these, 9 focus onhealth promotion in schools, 15 in universities, 5 in workplaces and 15 in communities.1. Health promotion in schoolsSchools are recognised worldwide as key settings for health promotion (Vilaça et al.,2019), as they provide access to a vast population of children from an early age todevelop health knowledge and healthy behaviours (Dadaczynski et al., 2020; Vieira &Carvalho, 2019), as well as to tackle social determinants of health inequality (WHO,2012). The 9 papers in this item are distributed in two issues:1.1. Four papers look at global school health education and promotion: Timothy JWalker and collaborators intended to better understand how components of a whole of school approach are implemented in practice by qualitatively exploring physicalactivity approaches and quantitatively assess implementation levels in US elementaryschools, and examined associations between school-level physical activity promotionand academic ratings; Adeline Darlington-Bernard and collaborators, did a scopingreview in English and French literature to identify definitions on Life Skills in the field ofhealth promotion at school, aiming to propose a conceptual definition and to reach aconceptual and consensual definition; Ulrich Hobusch and collaborators reported onthe integration of One Health principles educational frameworks, particularly withinthe context of the Austrian teaching training approach "Teaching Clinic", which alignswith the 2030 Agenda, Education for Sustainable Development, and the SustainableDevelopment Goals; and Chloé Gay and collaborators developed methodologies forcollecting and analysing mass qualitative data, enabling to measure how a cohortidentifies and prioritises preventive interventions to identify differences in conceptionsof the determinants of health and cancer between girls and boys, as expressed andperceived by French school children and adolescents.1.2. Five papers focused on specific topics of school health education and promotion:Ruilin Yan and collaborators identified predictors of e-cigarette uptake in Chineseyouths with no prior tobacco use, considering individual, familial and the broadersocietal environmental factors; Hailing Li and Jadeera Phaik Geok Cheong designed and developed a functional training programme (ADDIE) that can be incorporated intoexisting physical education lessons to improve Malaysian primary school students'physical fitness levels; Matthew Lee Smith and collaborators described the Revved UpKids (RUK) intervention in US that provides necessary tools for elementary-agedchildren recognise and avoid dangerous people and situations, and evaluated itscomponents and documents effectiveness; August Summers and collaboratorselucidated how parents/guardians of elementary and middle school students inMaryland (USA) navigated the return to in-person school following remote instructionand understand how they perceived communication about school-based COVID-19mitigation strategies and their preferences for the content and format of public healthcommunication about COVID-19 mitigation in schools; and Ingeborg Hyde andcollaborators examined the current state of social innovation and entrepreneurshipprogramming, courses, and centres within US schools of public health, identifying keyareas as opportunities for growth.2. Health promotion in universitiesInstitutions of higher education are recognised as relevant settings to protect healthand promote the well-being of the academic community (students, staff and the widercommunity) through their policies and practices and by linking health promotion toteaching and research (Sun & Shu, 2022; Tsouros et al., 1998). Of the 15 papers in thisitem, 6 are on health topics related to higher education students, 5 on medical andnurse students' training and their health conditions, and 4 on situations related toCOVID-19 in higher education.2.1. Six papers look at health topics related to high education students: SebastianHeller and collaborators investigated, in Germany, which of the predominant healthbehaviours (physical activity, healthy diet, sleep, sedentary behaviour, alcoholconsumption, smoking, drug use) are most associated with academic performance and whether the personal resource of trait mindfulness moderates these associations;Garry Ladd determined the status of Health, Wellness, Physical Fitness Lecture(HWPFL) and Health-Related Physical Activity (HRPA) courses in Texas communitycolleges; Abdulelah M. Aldhahir and collaborators evaluated the smoking prevalenceamong students on healthcare courses in Saudi Arabia; María Lavilla-Gracia andcollaborators estimated the effectiveness of the peer-led BASICS intervention toreduce risky alcohol consumption among university students in the Spanish context;Kaiqi Tang and collaborators explored the association between health informationpreferences and specific health behaviours and outcomes, such as preventivemeasures and chronic disease management among Chinese college students; andAsem Alkhatib and collaborators evaluated the effectiveness of the traditional ChineseBaduanjin exercise on reducing the menstrual symptoms for international femalestudents studying in China during the acculturation period.2.2. Five papers focus on issues related to medical and nurse students' training andtheir health conditions: Ivonne-Nadine Jürgensen and collaborators did a scopingreview to highlight the current scope of research on the health of health professionalstudents; Enrique Ramón-Arbués and collaborators determined the prevalence ofsymptoms of depression and anxiety, and the association between these symptomsand health-related behaviours in a population of Spanish student nurses; Eun HeeHwang and Kon Hee Kim examined the mediating effects of self-directed learningcompetency on the relationships between optimism, emotional intelligence andacademic resilience among South Korea nursing students; Xiaoqi Yang andcollaborators verified the role of Chinese medical students' physical literacy on health related quality of life and explored the chain mediating role of physical activity andsubjective well-being in it; and Vicente Antonio Gea-Caballero and collaboratorsestimated the level of attitudinal change in nursing students for immigrants, based ona training intervention with sessions of coexistence with immigrants in Spain.2.3. Four papers explore situations related to COVID-19 in higher education: NisreenAlwan and collaborators assessed hand hygiene awareness and practice levels amongvarious university communities in Lebanon; Liat Korn and collaborators estimatedacademic distress among Israel undergraduate students following COVID-19,characterised its nature regarding economic, social, and health indicators, andexamined the level of request for help subsequent mental distress; Ronit Ahdut-HaCohen and Paz Carmel examined the impact of Israel academic institutions onchanges to students' awareness and habits regarding a healthy lifestyle, specificallythrough nutrition and physical exercise, following the Covid-19 pandemic; and NoeliaNavas-Echazarreta and collaborators analysed the differences in smartphone use andthe prevalence of nomophobia according to gender and university degree of healthsciences students at the University of Zaragoza, Spain, during the COVID-19confinement.3. Health promotion in workplacesWorkplace Health Promotion refers to policies and practices that encourageemployers, employees and society to improve the health and well-being of people atwork by improving the work organisation and environment, promoting activeemployer and employee participation and encouraging personal development(ENWHP, 2018).3.1. The five papers submitted to this item focused on health promotion in workplaces:Andrea Schaller and collaborators did a scoping review of reviews to obtain anoverview of the main objectives and related outcomes of physical activityinterventions in workplace health promotion, as well as the setting-specific aspectsconsidered in the research field; Julian Friedrich and collaborators investigated theassociation of occupational health literacy (individual level), health-oriented leadership(interpersonal level), participation possibilities in health, and values of health inGerman companies (both organisational levels) on work ability; DeLong Wang andcollaborators assessed the level of health literacy and health investment intentionamong employees in one of China's largest petrochemical companies and explored the effect of health literacy on health investment intention; Tom Brandt and collaborators investigated whether resistance exercise snacking could be an efficient training approach for the workplace health promotion to minimise barriers for participation and facilitate resistance training in German women to improve musculoskeletal fitness; and Tom Brandt and collaborators investigated whether CrossFit® is an effective training concept to motivate German employees towards healthy behaviours to improve fitness and health in the long-term in inactive employees with sedentary occupations.4. Health promotion in communitiesCommunity health promotion seeks to enable "people to have control over theirhealth and its determinants strengthens communities and improves lives" (WHO,2012, p.1). Ethnic minorities and some migrant communities suffer health inequalitiesdisproportionately (WHO, 2012). Community participation is crucial to creating theconditions that empower people to have greater control over their health and wellbeing within their specific social context (South, 2014). The 15 papers in this item are equally distributed in the following three issues:4.1. Five papers focus on community minorities, inequalities and inclusion: Marisa L.Kutchma and collaborators monitored the implementation of a programme on USvulnerable communities (Black, Hispanic, or low-income people) that included freecommunity-based testing, screening for and assistance with social determinants ofhealth, dissemination of relevant and reliable COVID-related information, provision ofpersonal protective equipment, and facilitation of access to vaccines; Kavya Krishnanand collaborators assessed the feasibility of the crowdsourcing method to provide analternative approach that can improve household waste segregation using an 'online slogan-contest' in different geographic regions of India; Nicole Yao and collaboratorsexamined perspectives of experienced Community Health Workers (CHWs) about howCHWs can be integrated and utilised in US school settings to work as part of school based health teams to support student health and healthy school environments; OscarKohut and collaborators interviewed students of Hospital Lang Youth Medical Program(LYMP) participating for ten years in a mentoring and enrichment program forunderrepresented minority youth in Upper Manhattan (USA) to explore theirperspectives on what aspects of the program had the most impact on their academicand career paths; and Khadra Yasien Ahmed and collaborators developed a pilotintervention in Norway aiming to improve health in migrant communities throughmeaningful integration of highly educated migrants in academic environments.4.2. Five papers look at health topics related to nutrition, physical activity, and sexualand reproductive rights: Lynne M. Z. Lafave and collaborators revised and updated theCanadian Behaviour, Attitude and Nutrition Knowledge Survey (C-BANKS) to align withthe current Canadian food guide and dietary guidance and also reported on itsreliability and validity; Matías Monsalves-Álvarez and collaborators developedcommunity intervention strategies in Chile, using a participatory action researchapproach by identifying barriers and facilitators on the practice of healthy eating andphysical activity habits; Yin Qin and collaborators made a correction to the paper thatlooked at the effects of whole-body electromyostimulation training on upper limbmuscles strength and body composition in moderately trained Chinese males; PatriciaArnaiz and collaborators evaluated the short-term effects of the physical and healthKaziKidz intervention on cardiometabolic risk factors and the long-term, pre-and post-COVID-19 pandemic changes thereof in South African high-risk children frommarginalised communities; and Mekdes Mengesha Jemberie and collaboratorsassessed husbands' knowledge, involvement and factors influencing their involvementin Ethiopian women's sexual and reproductive health rights.4.3. Five papers explore health education and health literacy in communities: OparaMonica Onyinyechi and collaborators synthesised in a systematic review the evidenceof the impact of health education on malaria knowledge and insecticide-treated nets(ITN) usage in sub-Saharan Africa; Jingyi Zhao and Cun Fu examined the role oflanguage in discerning the authenticity of online health rumours in China to betterunderstand the credibility of online health information; Nayara Tamayo-Fonseca andcollaborators assessed the level of health literacy and analysed its relationship withsociodemographic variables, state of health, and use of health services in thepopulation aged 15 and over in the Valencian Community of Spain; Keiko Murakamiand collaborators estimated the associations of combinations of general HealthLiteracy (HL) and COVID-19-related HL with COVID-19 protective behaviours andhealthy lifestyle behaviours in Japanese metropolitan areas; and Yi Luo andcollaborators investigated the impact of cultural capital on health literacy during theCOVID-19 pandemic among Chinese community residents and to further examine themediating role of social capital in the relationship between cultural capital and healthliteracy.The research presented in these 44 papers published in the Public Health researchtopic "Health Promotion in Schools, Universities, Workplaces, and Communities" camefrom 18 countries of the various continents, demonstrating how live and pertinent isthis field of research worldwide, presenting different approaches and perspectives thatenrich this large, contemporary and relevant research field, which is still open to wideranging and diverse future research.

N2  - Pepper Wilt complex disease is one of the devastating soil-borne diseases, due to which 68-70% yield loss is recorded. Effects of different fungicides and application methods on wilt incidence and yield of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) were tested for two years at Fogera and for one year at Dera districts of South Gondar zone Ethiopia. Effects of fungicides viz. copper oxychloride (Isacope 50WP), mancozeb + metalaxyl (Omaxim), thiamethoxam + metalaxyl + difenoconazole (Apron Star 42WS), copper hydroxide (Sinoko) and application methods viz. seed +seedling treatment, seed + seedling treatment followed by spraying at crown region of the plant on wilt disease incidence and pepper yield were studied at Fogera and Dera districts of South Gondar zone Ethiopia. The fungicides were applied at the rates of 3 kg/ha, 2 kg/ha, 20 g/ha and 2.5 kg/ha for Isacope 50WP, Omaxim, Apron Star 42WS and Sinoko, respectively. The seeds of pepper treated with fungicides and untreated were sown in seedling bed. The 45-day old seedlings were uprooted from the seed bed and subjected to the seedling treatment in different fungicides for 30 minutes and were planted in field. The spraying of the fungicides at crown region of the plant was done at 15 days interval after the initiation of wilt disease. The data on wilt incidence and yield were recorded in each treatment. The price of pepper was assessed from the local market and the total price of the yield obtained from each treatment was computed on hectare basis. Input costs like fungicide and labor were converted into hectare basis according to their frequencies used. Based on the obtained data from the above-mentioned parameters economic analysis was performed. The result of the experiment indicates that, during 2020 year, the highest disease reduction (61.11% and 51.39%) over check and maximum dry pod yield (21.95 q/ha and 48.46 q/ha) was observed with T6 (seed treatment+ seedling treatment +foliar spraying with fungicide Omaxim (mancozeb + metalaxyl) at Fogera and Dera, respectively. Similarly, highest disease reduction (26.66%) and maximum green pod yield was observed in T6 at Fogera during 2021 year. Moreover, economic analysis revealed that T6 (application of seed treatment+ seedling treatment + foliar spraying of fungicide Omaxim within 15 days interval) is effective treatment.

N2  - Pollination is a critical link in the functioning of ecosystems, and it improves the yield of crops. Insect pollination is an essential input in the production of crops grown worldwide. Of the approximately 300 commercial crops about 84% are insect pollinated. Honeybees are responsible for 70-80% of insect pollination. This indicated how much honeybees are the most efficient insect pollinators of cultivated crops and wild flora in agricultural systems. The main reason is that honeybees are abundant and widespread everywhere. They have well developed mechanism of communication to exploit their environment. The value of additional yields obtained by pollination service rendered by honeybees is 15-20 times more than the value of all hive products put together. Studies conducted in Ethiopia have also proven the role of honeybee pollination in improving the yield and quality of some crops such as Malus sylvestris (apple), Allium cepa (red onion), Guizotia abyssinica (niger) and Vicia faba (faba bean). The yield increment was varied from 33.5-84% among the above crops due to honeybee pollination. However, unwise pesticide applications become the main problem for some crops in Ethiopia. This is due to, low level understanding of the value of pollination on the yield of agricultural crops. Therefore, attention should be given for the legal protection of honeybees and other insect pollinators; especially, protecting the honeybees from pesticide poisoning, developing pollinators’ conservation policy, the idea of crop pollination should be included in national crop production strategic plan and awareness creation should be given to the society about the value of crop pollination.

N2  - Emmer wheat is produced mostly in the highlands of Ethiopia, including Bale. There is a significant amount of emmer wheat in Bale zone during both bona (main) and gena (short) cropping seasons and is one of the major crops in the region. However, its production and productivity is curtailed by leaf rust which is caused by <i>Puccinia tritici</i> and nitrogen fertilizer management. A field experiment was conducted to determine the effect of nitrogen fertilizer on emmer wheat production and to evaluate integrated effect of nitrogen fertilizer and fungicide application on disease severity, yield and yield related traits of emmer wheat at two locations from 2012-2014 main cropping season. Treatments were composed of one improved variety (Sinana-01), fungicide spray timing: at growth stages of (GS) 33-36, 33-36&59-69, nil and complete control (at 7 days interval) and nitrogen fertilizer: at the rate of 0, 23, 46 and 69 kg/ha. Plots were set in factorial arrangement laid in randomized complete block design in three replications. There was difference among the four levels of N-fertilizer application in grain yield and leaf rust severity. The highest and lowest grain yield was obtained from 0-23 kg/ha and 46-69 kg/ha N-fertilizer, respectively. Maximum mean disease severity was recorded from maximum N-fertilizer application. Difference was observed among fungicide treatments in controlling leaf rust. Highest mean leaf rust severity was recorded on nil fungicide application while the lowest from fungicide application at 7-days interval (complete control). Optimum level of nitrogen fertilizer (0-23 kg/ha) and at least one time spray of fungicide should be recommended for emmer wheat production in Bale.

N2  - JBI Centre College of Public Health and Medical Sciences, Jimma University Ethiopia - JBI Centre for Evidence Synthesis P. O. Box- 378 Jimma, Ethiopia Collaborating Institution: Joanna Briggs Institute, Faculty of Health Sciences, The University of Adelaide, South Australia, SA 5005, Australia Review Questions/ Objectives What is the effect of Schistosoma infection on malaria immune response in above 4 year old individuals and what implications does this have on malaria vaccine trials in sub- Saharan Africa? Objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effect of Schistosoma infection on the immune response to Malaria antigens and provide direction to future Malaria vaccination trials. Background Worldwide an estimated number of 225 million cases and about 800, 000 deaths occurred due to Malaria in the year 2009 1. Malaria is caused by a protozoan parasite plasmodium2. Four species of the plasmodium genus cause malaria in humans: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae.3 Currently, there are several malaria control strategies such as residual house spraying, insecticide-treated bed nets, and anti-malarial drugs. Due to drug resistance of the parasites, chemical resistance of the vectors, and given the time and cost required for the development of new anti-malarial drugs, malaria vaccines have been developed as a future malaria control strategy. 4, 5 Several antigens of the plasmodium species have been developed for use as a malaria vaccine. These antigens are classified as pre-erythrocytic vaccines, erythrocytic vaccines, and transmission blocking vaccines. Hereafter we will refer to malaria vaccines that have entered into clinical trials. Pre-erythrocytic vaccines includes circumsporozoite protein vaccines (RTS,S, CS102, and MAP), and DNA vaccines (Plasmid DNA vaccines such as the Multi-Stage DNA Operation, MuStDO; and Live Recombinant Vaccines that use the attenuated modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA), fowlpoxvirus (FPV), Adenovirus, Sindbis virus, yellow fever virus or a cold adapted influenza virus strain as a vector. 6-11 Erythrocytic vaccines consists of SPf66 vaccine, merozoite surface proteins 1 (MSP-1), 2 (MSP-2), 3 (MSP-3), the apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) and the glutamate-rich protein (GLURP). 12, 13 Transmission-blocking vaccines include vaccines that contain the P. falciparum ookinate surface antigens Pfs25 and Pfs28 as well as their P. vivax homologues Pvs25 and Pvs28.14-16 Among the malaria vaccines erythrocytic malaria vaccines such as MSP are the most advanced. 17 These malaria vaccines require a coordinated humeral and cell-mediated immune response to offer immunity to malaria. The humeral immunity is affected by merozoite specific IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 antibody responses that block merozoite invasion of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) and is also the main mechanism of immune response. 18 In addition to antibody response an immune response mediated by CD4+ T cell and B-cell, which occurs after infection is required for a full protection. 19, 20 A high antibody response, 21, 22 persistence of memory B cells to the MSP 23 and lack of apoptotic deletion of parasite specific Th1 CD4+ T cells 24 are required for long-term immunity after malaria vaccination. Moreover, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-10 and TGF-β play a role in malaria immunity. Anti-IFN-γ treatment prevents apoptosis of Th1 CD4+ T cells, 24 implicating IFN-γ as an inhibitory factor to the long-term immunity. TGF- β is also known to inhibit Th2 CD4+ T cells. 25 While IL-10 protect against severe Th1 mediated pathogenesis in Plasmodium berghei infections. 26 Thus, long-term immunity to malaria could be affected by any factor that could affect the humeral, cell-mediated, and pro-inflammatory cytokine immune responses described above. One of these factors is co-infection of a patient with both malaria and other diseases. Recent studies have shown an inverse relationship between CD+ T cells number and plasmodium parasite density in individuals co-infected with Human Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) and malaria. 27 Helminthes which are chronic parasitic infections also affect long-term immune response to malaria by biasing the immune response from Th1 to Th2 response and leading to cellular hypo-responsiveness. 28 Schistosomes which belong to the blood flukes trematode genus Schistosoma consists of five species which cause human schistosomiasis: the intestinal species S. mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi, and S. intercalatum and the urinary species S. haematobium.29, 30 Among these species S.mansoni, S. hematobium, and S.intercalatum are common in Africa. 31 Schistosomiasis has been shown to infect approximately 200 million people around the world, 80 % of which live in sub-Saharan Africa. 32 Most of the people infected by schistosomiasis are school-age children exposed to river water harbouring the intermediate snail for Schistosoma. 33 Due to their limited mobility, the prevalence of schistosomiasis in children under five years of age is very low to 0%. 34 Malaria and Schistosomiasis are often geographically co-endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. 35 Co-infections may affect the level of morbidity and immunological factors may alter responses to common treatment options. 36, 37Schistosoma mansoni has reduced the incidence of cerebral malaria in mice infected with S. mansoni and co-infected with Plasmodium berghei 7 weeks after by biasing the immune response towards Th2. 38 In addition, children lightly infected with Schistosoma hematobium were found to have low plasmodium parasite densities than those who were not infected. 39 Therefore, due to its co-endemicity and wider geographic area it shares with malaria as well as its effect on malaria immune response, schistosomiasis should be considered as a confounding factor in any study that aims to measure immune response after a challenge with a candidate malaria vaccine. Thus, the evidence on the effect of Schistosoma infection on malaria immune response needs to be synthesized so that future malaria vaccination trials as well as mass Schistosoma treatment campaigns would affect into account as a confounding factor. The presence of existing systematic reviews on the current topic was assessed with a thorough search of major databases including: Mednar, Pubmed, EMBASE, JBI Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL. The search revealed an absence of systematic reviews with a similar question and objectives. However, few primary observational studies are available: a cross-sectional pilot study from Ghana,40 and cohort studies from Senegal and Mali. 41-43 To date there are no systematic reviews which have examined the effect of Schistosoma infection on malaria immune response. Therefore, this review will provide the best available evidence for the effects of Schistosoma infection on Malaria immune response in co-infected individuals. Since this review is about the relationship between Schistosoma infection and immune response to malaria observational studies such as cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies will be used. Inclusion criteria Types of Studies This review will consider: Cross-sectional, Cohort, Case-control studies, Randomised Controlled Trials and Quasi-Randomised Controlled Trial will be included. Types of Participants- This review will consider studies where the subjects included are above 4 years old individuals and have diagnoses of Schistosoma and Malaria as an intervention group; and a diagnosis of malaria only as a control group. Phenomenon of interest The phenomenon of interest if the presence of Schistosoma infection and immune response to Malaria Comparator The review will consider studies where the control subjects are individuals infected with Malaria and without Schistosoma infection. Types of Outcomes The outcomes of interest for this review are measures of immune response to Malaria in individuals infected with Schistosoma species. Anticipated outcome measures include: Primary outcome: will be expressed in the form of the number of persons with a plasmodium specific Th1 (protect against liver stage parasites) and Th2 (protect against blood stage parasites) immune response to MSPs 1, 2, and 3 of Plasmodium species. Secondary Outcome: will be expressed in the form of the number of persons with plasmodium specific Immune response in the form of IgG 1, IgG 2, IgG3,INF-γ, IL-10, and TGF-β Exclusion criteria Case series or case reports will be excluded from the analysis, because they are not strong enough to show the relationship between Schistosoma infection and malaria immune response. Studies on less than 4 years old individuals will also be excluded from the review. Additionally, studies on the relationship between Malaria immune response and helminthes other that Schistosomiasis, HIV co-infected individuals, and pregnant women will be excluded from the analysis. Studies with control subjects with Malaria and co-infection with other parasites will also be excluded. Search strategy This review will consider studies conducted after 1994 (time the term Malaria vaccine is introduced), to the present date. The search strategy will focus on Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes and will be breakdown into specific search terms.Table 1: Overview of search termsThe search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy will be utilized. An initial limited search of Medline and CINAHL will be undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the article. A second search using all of the identified keywords and index terms will be undertaken across all of the included databases. Thirdly, the reference lists of all identified reports and articles will be search for additional studies. The initial search terms are listed below and will be modified for the various databases and search engines. ["Child" OR "Children"] AND ["age 5-14 years"] AND ["malaria and Schistosoma co-infection"] AND ["Schistosoma infection" OR "s.hematobium" OR "s. mansoni"] AND "[plasmodium falciparum" OR "plasmodium vivax" infection] AND ["Th1" OR "Th2" OR "IgG1" OR "IgG2" OR "IgG3"OR "IFN-γ" OR "IL-10" OR "TGF-β"] Databases to be searched include: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Mednar, Proquest, and Hinari. Assessment of Methodological quality: The papers selected for retrieval will be assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). Each paper will be critically appraised by two independent reviewers using the JBI-MASTARI Critical Appraisal Instrument (Appendix I) and any disagreement that arise between reviewers will be resolved through discussion or by consultation with a third reviewer. Extraction of data Data will be extracted from studies that fulfil the inclusion criteria using a standardized data extraction tool from JBI- MASTARI (Appendix - II). The data extracted will include details about the phenomenon of interest, population, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and review objectives. Data Analysis/Data Synthesis Quantitative papers will, were possible will be pooled in statistical meta-analysis using JBI-MAStARI. All results will be subject to double data entry. Where statistical pooling is not appropriate or possible, the findings will be presented in narrative summary. Conflict of Interest Neither financial nor intellectual conflicts of interest are associated with this work with other organizations or individuals.

N2  - The viability of commercial Rhizobium strains (SB-14 and SB-12) were inoculated and fungicides (Mancozeb and Ridomil) were used as seed dressed on soybean seed to investigate their effect on nodulation, plant growth and seed yield of soybean. Application of Rhizobial inoculants alone gave the highest nodulation and shoot dry weight performance as well as seed yield of soybean on both sites. SB-12 inoculant had significantly shown to be more effective than SB-14 inoculant in increasing nodulation and thus produced higher plant growth and seed yield. Rhizobial survival on the seeds was severely affected by both fungicides, resulting in decreased nodulation, plant growth and seed yield for both inoculants. However, Ridomil fungicide gave the lowest nodulation and seed yield when applied with either SB-12 or SB-14 Rhizobial strains. The strains differed in their sensitivity to Mancozeb fungicide that with strain SB-12 showed a slight effect or no effect on survival of rhizobium, nodulation and yield of soybean. Seed-dressing of mancozeb and ridomil resulted in reduction of seed yield by 882.8 kg ha-1 and 1154.7 kg ha-1, respectively with SB-12 strain. The present results indicate that inoculated Rhizobium inoculants differ in their capacity to develop resistance to the two dressed fungicides. Seed treatment with Mancozeb in combination with SB-12 strain slightly affected the survival of the inoculated strain. Consequently, mancozeb fungicide may be compatable with survival of the inoculated SB-12 Rhizobia. The results also indicate that the suppressive effects of seed-applied fungicides on Rhizobium strains survival and nodulation development depend on specific strain and fungicide. Soybean seeds inoculated with SB-12 may not need management with fungicides or lower concentration of Mancozeb that could be compatible with SB-12 to suppress soil-borne pathogens for both Assosa and Begi sites, western Ethiopia.

N2  - The experiment was conducted between December 2017 and May 2018 at Bako, Ethiopia to study the effectiveness of traditional (Gombisa, Sack) and Hermetic bag storage structures and storage periods on fungal contamination of stored maize grain on agar plate method. The incidence and frequency of storage fungi was determined at 0, 2, 4 and 6 months of storage periods. The experiment was replicated three times in factorial design. The design was 3×4 in factorial fashion. The treatments were three storage types (Gombisa, sack and Hermetic bag), one variety of maize (Bako hybrid-661) and storage periods (0, 2, 4 and 6) months. The collected data were analyzed statistically using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) procedure of SAS and means that were significantly different were separated using Least Significant Difference (LSD). Fungi were the major causes of deterioration and quality loss on stored maize grains during the storage period. The fungal incidence and frequency significantly different (p<0.05) increased with storage periods. The highest (39.4%) Fusarium species incidence was recorded at the last six months of storage. Fusurium spp. occurred in Gombisa with the highest 29.9% incidence and 23% frequency, respectively. The highest frequency of Aspergillus species 26.7% was recorded in Gombisa whereas the minimum 18% was obtained from Hermetic bag in the six months of storage periods. In this study, Fusurium spp. was the most prevailing storage fungi followed by Aspergillus spp. As a result of this research, the Hermetic bag was determined to be more appropriate for protecting the stored maize grains from fungal attack during the storage periods and the stored grains have low fungal incidence and frequency until initial to four months. Therefore, gombisa and sack storages were inadequate for protecting stored maize from insect pests and fungal attacks. Overall, the hermetic bag storage can protect insect infestation and fungal development and consequently maintains seed viability and nutritional content during storage without use of insecticides. Key words: Moisture, temperature, humidity, fungi, storage.

N2  - Faba bean is suffered with many biotic and abiotic factors. Chocolate spot disease, caused by Botrytis fabae is one of the biotic factors limiting yields of this crop resulting in yield losses up to 68% in Ethiopia. The experiment was conducted during 2020/2021 cropping season at Tach Gayint district, Ethiopia to determine the integration of faba bean varieties and fungicide rates on reducing chocolate spot disease. The experiment consisted of 12 treatments, viz. three faba bean varieties and four rate of Mancozeb fungicide in factorial arrangement. The experiment was laid out as randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Data was collected and analyzed. Results indicated that, disease incidence was reached at maximum percentage in all treatments on the last dates of assessment. But treatments were significantly difference in severity level. The least disease severity was recorded from varieties treated by 3.5 kg/ha of Mancozeb 80% WP with mean values Walki (12.7%), and (18.1% and 20.8%) on Gora and local variety respectively at the final dates of disease assessment. Similarly, the reduced AUDPC was also recorded from varieties treated by 3.5 kg/ha of Mancozeb 80% WP with mean values Walki (371.8% unit/day) and (539% and 686.4% days) on varieties Gora, and Local respectively. Whereas the maximum disease severity and AUDPC were obtained from unsprayed plots. Based on the results obtained, variety Walki treated with Mancozeb 80% WP at rate of 2.5 kg/ha and 3.5 kg/ha were effective to reduce the effect of chocolate spot disease for the study area.

N2  - <ns3:p>Background Parthenium is an invasive annual weed that affects crop production, rangelands, grasslands, animals, the environment, and human health. Since its introduction into Ethiopia, different management options such as uprooting, slashing, burning, plowing, and applying synthetic herbicides have been practiced. However, these options are not sustainable in weed management. However, <ns3:italic>Zygogramma bicolorata</ns3:italic> is known to be used in different countries. Although many countries use it under field conditions, its population-based efficacy has not been well studied in Ethiopia. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of <ns3:italic>Z. bicolorata</ns3:italic> populations on parthenium plants under greenhouse conditions. Methods This experiment was conducted at the Ambo Agricultural Research Center. Different numbers of <ns3:italic>Z. bicolorata</ns3:italic> per plant were used as treatments and were laid out in a completely randomized design with three replications. The numbers of damaged leaves, eggs, and larvae were recorded daily until the leaves were completely defoliated. The collected data and the correlation between beetle population and leaf defoliation were analyzed using SAS. Results The result revealed that all beetle populations caused damage to weed plants. A higher population of beetles completely defoliated the leaves within 12 days. However, lower numbers required 21 days to completely defoliate the weed. In contrast, a higher number of eggs (328.67) and larvae (272.33) were obtained from plants that received 20 pairs of beetles. The beetle population and exposure time were positively correlated, and the effectiveness of the bioagent was greater following the emergence of larvae. Conclusions <ns3:italic>Z. bicolorata</ns3:italic> can manage parthenium weeds, even with a lower population. However, more than 15 pairs of beetles could be suggested to manage weeds in a shorter time, and further study is needed under field conditions by considering the different agroecologies of the country.</ns3:p>

N2  - Wheat is one of the most important food security crops which is cultivated from small to large scale farms in Ethiopia. However, its productivity has been limited due to various abiotic and biotic factors including weeds. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of seed rates and post emergence herbicides application on weed management and productivity of wheat. Factorial combinations of three levels of seed rates (100,150 and 200 kg ha -1 )and four types of herbicides (Agro 2,4-D 720 g/L 1lt ha -1 ,Pallas 45 OD 0.5lt ha -1 ,Derby 175 SC 100ml ha -1 and Lancolet 450 WG 33 gm ha -1 )along with control (a weedy check) were laid out in RCBD with three replications. A total of identified 12 weed species were recorded (86 % broad and 14 % grass weeds). Results also revealed that significant effects of seed rate by herbicide interaction for all the traits studied. The minimum weed densities (2.7 m -2 ) at 45 days after planting , dry biomass of grass weeds (33.33 kg ha -1 ) and the highest weed control efficiency (81.22%) were recorded from the interaction effects of 150 seed rate with Pallas 45 OD while the minimum dry biomass of broad leaf weeds (53.33 kg ha -1 ) was recorded at 200 kg ha -1 seed rate with Lancolet 450 Wattable Granule (WG). The highest number of productive tillers(133.33 m -2 ),seeds per spike(76.48), thousand grain weight (44.36 g),grain yield (4516.42 kg ha -1 )and biological yield(13100 kg ha -1 ) were recorded from the combination of 150 kg ha -1 seed rate with Pallas 45 OD while the lowest values were observed from the weedy check .Grain yield had strong positive correlations with each of the yield components, however it was negatively correlated with dry weed biomass. Based on partial budget analysis, the maximum net benefit was obtained from the interaction of 150 kg ha -1 seed rate with Pallas 45 OD but higher number of marginal rate of return was calculated from 150 kg ha -1 seed rate with 2,4-D . It was also observed that, the combined use of seed rate 150 kg ha -1 with Pallas 45 OD effectively managed weeds, economical and gave maximum yields, which could be recommended for the test environment. Since the experiment was conducted in one location and for a single season, it should be repeated over seasons or multi locations for best recommendation.

N2  - A field experiment was conducted at Kulumsa center of the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research (EIAR) during September 2011 and January 2011 to assess the efficacy of botanical insecticides against the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum and their effect on the commonly associated natural enemies of the pest.Aqueous extracts of different parts of four plant species, namely Trev.), young leaves of Blue Gum (Eucalyptus A. Juss) and matured leaves of Aloe ( concentrations (5 and 10%) were tested along with the standard insecticide Pirimicarb 50% WP and untreated check on pea aphid tolerant variety (Tegegnech) and susceptible variety (Mohanderfer).The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications.The lowest and highest aphid population and damage level were recorded from the standard insecticide (Pirimicarb) and untreated plots, respectively.Aphid population and their damage in botanical treatments were intermediate between the standard and the untreated check.Eucalyptus globulus resulted in lower aphid population and damage level than the re of botanical treatments.Similarly, the lowest and highest yield were recorded from the untreated and Pirimicarb treated plots, respectively.Differences between any of the botanical and Pirimicarb treatments were not significant for yield ( 0.51 to 0.81 tons/ha higher yield than the untreated check.This corresponds to a yield advantage of 21.1 to 33.5% over the untreated control.Aphid population in variety 'Tegegnech' was similar to that of the 'Mohanderfer' but damage seve rate (10 %) resulted in lower pest populations, less damage and higher yield than the low rate (5 %).Predation and parasitism were relatively high in the untreated plots, intermediate in botanical treated plots and low in Pirimicarb treatments suggesting that botanicals were safer to the natural enemies of the pest

N2  - Efficacy of the entomopathogen fungus, <i>Beauveria bassiana</i> (BotaniGard) was compared with conventional insecticides against whiteflies on Poinsettia (<i>Euphorbia pulcherrima</i>) and Dahlia (<i>Dahlia coccinea</i>) in Maranque plant located at Doni in Eastern Shoa zone of Ethiopia between December 2010 and March 2011. The experimental site measuring 1250 m<sup>²</sup> was divided in 6 bays. Three bays in alternative fashion were allocated for treatment with the test pesticide, BotaniGard and the other three for spraying with the conventional insecticides according to the routine practice of the farm. BotaniGard was applied at the concentration of 0.15% by mixing 150 ml of the product with 100 l of water weekly for the first ten weeks and twice weekly thereafter until the termination of the experiment. Mean whitefly number per treatment was calculated to examine population fluctuation in adjacent BotaniGard and control treatments of both Dahlia and poinsettia. To assess presence of statistical differences in whitefly population between treatments as well as between plant species, a student t-test was used using counts recorded from each of the 12 cards per treatment at the different weeks. Population of whiteflies was generally low in both plant species until 17 January 2011 without appreciable difference in whiteflies number between the BotaniGard and the conventional insecticides. Whiteflies number increased after 17 January in both plant species and peaked on 7 February 2011. Pest population in BotaniGard treated bed was lower than conventional insecticides treated bed during this period in both plant species. Whiteflies population in Poinsettia fluctuated between 3.9 and 42 per trap compared to between 0.6 and 24.8 in Dahlia in the conventional insecticide treatment. On BotaniGard treated plot, whiteflies number fluctuated between 2.5 and 17.6 in poinsettia and between 1.8 and 12.5 in Dahlia. This difference between Dahlia and poinsettia was significant (P<0.05) in 5 out of 12 sampling dates in the conventional treatment and in 7 out of 12 weeks in BotaniGard treatment. Dahlia was less susceptible to whiteflies and BotaniGard resulted in lower number of whiteflies than the conventional insecticide treatment. Hence, BotaniGard may be used as a viable alternative to reducing the use of chemical insecticides in the management of whiteflies in green house produced plants.

N2  - Hot pepper is one of the most important spices, and vegetable cash crops cultivated during rainy and dry seasons. Powdery mildew caused by the fungus Leveillula taurica is becoming a serious threat to pepper production in South Ethiopia. The fungus causes significant damage to pepper production in irrigated fields during dry seasons. Three fungicides and five varieties had been studied in Arba Minch which is a highly prone area, The five varieties (C.annuum and C.frutescens) of pepper were sprayed with fungicides to evaluate for resistance and effectiveness of fungicides. Plots were sprayed every 7 days starting from the dates of first symptom appearance five times. The disease started at an early stage on older leaves and continues on young leaves. The mean disease severity significantly increased over time from the 7 to the 35 day. A significant (P&lt;0.05) variation had been observed among fungicides on disease severity index(DSI), Area under disease progress curve (AUDPC), and rate of disease progress(r) of which the fungicide triadimefon significantly P&lt; (0.05%) reduced AUDPC, rate of infection, and DSI, and showed 3.8% days; 0.039units/day; and 13% resp. and thus to minimize epidemic duration and rate of infection efficiently by 53% days and 33units/day resp. compared to Mancozeb. Among the varieties, Capsicum frutescens (Melkashote) significantly decreased AUDPC, rate of infection, and DSI revealing 3% days, 0.03units/day, and 5% resp., and reduced epidemic duration effectively by 70% and 57% days of AUDPC; and 57% and 40% units /day infection rate against (C. annuum: Alaba and Marekofana respectively). Pathogen reaction and grouping based on the level of DSI placed a variety Melkashote(5%) and Melkazala(10%) as moderately resistant; Melkaawaze(12%), and Marekofana(15%) to be moderately susceptible while the variety Alaba(22%) found distinctly susceptible. The C.annuum; Alaba and Marekofana varieties, showed the highest severity, DSI, AUDPC, and rate of infection, however, they significantly provided the highest pod yield of 1806 and 1794gm/plot respectively. Among the fungicides, triadimefon was effective to reduce the epidemics, and the varieties C. frutescens; Melkashote, and Melkazala were moderately resistant and retarded the disease efficiently.

N2  - Abstract Cactus ( Opuntia ficus-indica ) is a drought-resistant plant and the source of food and income for many farmers during the rainy season, and the only option to feed livestock during the dry seasons, especially in the southern part of the Tigray region of Ethiopia. The region is currently suffering from a damaging parasitoid of cactus called Dactylopius opuntiae- ficus biotype. An experimental study was conducted from August 2022 to February 2023 to investigate the efficacy of herbal extracts against cochineal insects. The experiment was conducted on the insecticidal property of methanol extracts of Solanum linnaenum , Euphorbia tirucalli , Nerium oleander , Tephrosia vogelii , Calpurnia aurea , Argemone Mexicana , Datura stramonium and Ricinus communis . Herbs were extracted, and their efficacy and LC 50 were determined. Phytochemical screening for secondary metabolites was performed. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean mortality of insects across the levels of the herbs ( F (8, 71) = 57.812, p = 0.0001, ƞ 2 = 0.867) and the experimental extract concentrations ( F (1, 71) = 4198.3, p = 0.0001, ƞ 2 = 0.983). The individual extracts of S. linnaenum and N. oleander caused average mortality rates of 99.3% and 97.4%, respectively, at 5% extract concentration. Tannins and saponins were the major metabolites found in the extracts. The present study demonstrated the promising insecticidal efficacy of herbal extracts against the damaging cacti pest D. opuntia -ficus biotype, providing insights into sustainable pest control strategies for protecting vital cactus resources in the Tigray region.

N2  - Pod borer is a major insect pest constraining chickpea production at southern Ethiopia. The experiment was conducted at Sodo district with the objective to evaluate the efficacy of different insecticides for the control of pod borer of chickpea. The experiment was conducted using one chickpea variety; Habru and five insecticides Diaznon (1.2l/ha), Diamethoate (1L/ha), Apron star (600g with 500l of water ha-1), Endosulfan (250g/ha) and Karate (400ml/ha). The result revealed that all insecticides were effective against pod borer with difference on percent larval population reduction. The pod borer damage reduction by insecticides treatment ranged from 35.4% to 68.6% and 39.5% to 76.7% compared to that in control. Diaznon and karate resulted maximum seed yield 1561.20 kg/ha and 1498.90 kg/ha, in 2017 and 1391.40kg/ha,1421.29 kg/ha in 2019 respectively. The highest larval reduction was obtained from plot treated with insecticide Diaznon followed by insecticide Karate 5% EC 68.6%, 64% during 2017 cropping season respectively and in 2019 cropping season highest larval reduction was obtained from plot treated with insecticide Karate 5% EC 76.7% followed by Diaznon treated plot 67.2%.In both 2017 and 2019 experimentalyears better yield increment was recorded from Diaznon and Karate 5% EC treated plot. During 2017 cropping season the maximum yield increment was obtained from Diaznon treated plot 27.3% followed by Karate 24.2% and during 2019 cropping season Karate 5% EC treated plot 32.6% followed by Diaznon treated plot 31.2%. Thus chickpea growers in the area should prefer the insecticides Karate 5% EC and Diaznon in mixed up for better pod borer management.

N2  - Maternal exposures to environmental hazards during pregnancy are key determinants of birth outcomes that affect health, cognitive and economic status later in life. In Ethiopia, various epidemiological evidences have suggested associations between environmental exposures such as household air pollution, cigarette smoking, and pesticide exposure and pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and birth defects.This review aimed at generating summarized evidence on the association between maternal exposure to environmental factors (household air pollution, cigarette smoking, and pesticide) and pregnancy outcomes (birth weight, preterm birth, and birth defects) in Ethiopia.A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library databases. All observational study designs were eligible for inclusion in the review. Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality assessment tools adopted for case-control and cross-sectional studies. The random-effects model was applied in computing the pooled estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Funnel and Doi plots were used for detecting the potential publication bias. All statistical analyses were performed using comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA 2.0) and MetaXL version 5.3 software.The pooled estimates revealed that prenatal biomass fuel use increased the risk of giving a low birth weight baby by twofold (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.33-3.31), and has no separate kitchen increases the risk of having low birth weight baby nearly by two and half times (OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.25-4.92). Overall, using biomass fuel as the main energy source for cooking and /or having no separate kitchen from the main house is 2.37 times more likely to give low birth weight babies (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.58-3.53). Active cigarette smoker women were 4 times (OR = 4.11, 95% CI: 2.82-5.89) more prone to have low birth weight babies than nonsmokers; and passive smoker women were 2.6 times (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.09-6.35) more risked to give low birth weight babies. It was also estimated that active cigarette smoker women were nearly 4 times (OR = 3.90, 95% CI: 2.36-6.45) more likely to give preterm birth babies. Pesticide exposure during pregnancy also increases the risk of the birth defect 4 times (OR = 4.44, 95% CI: 2.61-7.57) compared with non-exposed pregnant women.Household air pollution from biomass fuel use, active and passive cigarette smoking, and pesticide exposures are significantly associated environmental risk factors for low birth weight, preterm birth, and birth defects in Ethiopia. Therefore, Pregnant and lactating women should be aware of these environmental hazards during pregnancy. Promoting clean energy and improved and efficient stoves at the household level will help to reduce household air pollution-related adverse health effects.PROSPERO 2022: CRD42022337140.

N2  - Pesticides are intensively used in agriculture across the globe to prevent or control pests, diseases, and weeds. In this process, improper pesticide registration, distribution and use has become more serious, which has resulted in heavy environmental and human health risks in many parts of the world. This holds especially true for developing countries, including Ethiopia where good agricultural practices are often poorly implemented. To safeguard human health and the environment, a strict regulatory policy is essential. In line with this, Ethiopia has developed pesticide registration and control procedures, which are regulations and directives in which the country also included different international agreements related to agropesticides. Therefore, the overall policy with respect to pesticide plays a key role in improving the environment, the health of growers and the surrounding community and stimulates the economic performance of the Ethiopian agricultural sector. However, there was no clear answer to the question whether the policy on pesticide registration, distribution and use was implemented in an effective and sustainable way. Arguably, governance failures are the origin of many environmental and human health problems regarding pesticides in developing countries. This paper argues that the influence of state and non-state actors and the relative importance of their interactions are the major structural characteristics of pesticide governance. However, it is still important to ask what governing mechanisms and actors are available and what can be developed further to promote sustainable pesticide governance. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to investigate the pesticide policy-and-practice nexus, which includes the roles of governmental actors, private actors(traders) and farmers, and to review the actual and potential contribution from various governance actors in changing the existing (unsafe) pesticide practices in vegetables and cut flowers sector in which pesticides are used intensively.I have to conclude that both state and private actors hardly contribute to significant improvements in achieving sound pesticide management in Ethiopia. The state regulatory system has revealed an inability in controlling proper registration, distribution and safe use. Pesticide registration systems are not well established. A major challenge in pesticide registration is the double/ triple registration of pesticides with the same active ingredient (ai) but under different commercial names. Importing unregistered pesticides (only with import permits) by most flower growers allowed them to use extremely harmful/chemicals toxic to the environment and workers for higher risks. The government’s political commitment in this regard has never been observed in the floriculture industries, where there is no supervision or monitoring at all. In addition, commercial pesticide traders prove unable/unwilling to comply with regulations prescribed by the government proclamation. Among other problems, importation of pesticides with the wrong labels, conflicts of interest between importers (registrants) and double/triple registration of pesticides with the same (ai) under different commercial names cause confusion for retailers and farmers. Moreover, importation without obtaining a prior import permit and requests to import unregistered pesticides have grown over time. At the same time, the responsibility for controlling the pesticide market (inspection) failed in terms of quality control in distribution and use. The retailing of pesticides has been handled by unqualified and unlicensed retailers in shops and open markets with other commodities. Finally, this challenge is particularly critical at farm (local) level. There is substantial overuse, misuse and abuse of pesticides by end users, especially by smallholder farmers, due to lack of knowledge, technical support and training on hazards and risks associated with pesticides. Challenges to pesticide governance throughout the pesticide supply chain has resulted in negative policy outcomes for the environment and human health, particularly with the failure of state authorities to actively engage non-state actors in the complex pesticide registration, distribution and use system. Following the findings in this thesis, these situations call for the reshaping of the pesticide governance system throughout the country. To effectively address the human health and environmental impacts of pesticides requires a pesticide governance system that facilitates agricultural and environmental sustainability.

N2  - While recognizing the recent achievement in the global fight against malaria, the disease remains a challenge to health systems in low-income countries. Beyond widespread consensuses about prioritizing malaria prevention, little is known about the prevailing status of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) across different levels of wealth strata. The aim of this study was to evaluate the socioeconomic related dimension of inequalities in malaria prevention interventions. This study was conducted in July–August 2014 in Adami Tullu district in the South-central Ethiopia, among 6069 households. A cross-sectional data were collected on household characteristics, LLIN ownership and IRS coverage. Principal component analysis technique was used for ranking households based on socioeconomic position. The inequality was measured using concentration indices and concentration curve. Decomposition method was employed in order to quantify the percentage contribution of each socioeconomic related variable on the overall inequality. The proportion of households with at least one LLIN was 11.6 % and IRS coverage was 72.5 %. The Erreygers normalized concentration index was 0.0627 for LLIN and 0.0383 for IRS. Inequality in LLIN ownership was mainly associated with difference in housing situation, household size and access to mass-media and telecommunication service. Coverage of LLIN was low and significant more likely to be owned by the rich households, whereas houses were sprayed equitably. The current mass free distribution of LLINs should be followed by periodic refill based on continuous monitoring data.

N2  - The goal of the PSI/Ethiopia program is to reduce mortality and morbidity of children under five due to a) malaria, by improving the availability and use of long lasting insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs), and b) diarrhea and intestinal worms, by improving the availability and use of point of use water treatment systems, increasing use of zinc based diarrhea treatment kits, and among children 0-14 years by increasing the regular use of de-worming tablets. Shortly before this baseline su rvey, PSI/Ethiopia launched WaterGuard, an innovative point of use water purification system, and intends to launch a zinc-based diarrhea t reatment kit (which includes oral rehydration salts) and a de-worming tablet. These products are to be socially marketed through private sector outlets at subsidized prices. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June and July 2006 among mothers with children 0-4 years in the SNNPR region of Ethiopia. A multi-stage stratified sampling was used in the survey, with a total of 804 eligible women recruited in rural and urban areas. PSI/Ethiopia used the methodology of project TRaC, which is designed to provide actionable evidence for decision making as well as helping to measure the impact of project interventions and activities.

N2  - The main objective of the project was to assess policy, institutional and technological strategies to promote more productive and sustainable land management in the environmentally degraded highlands of Ethiopia. Primary cross-sectional data was collected at community, household and plot levels in the highlands of Tigray beginning in late 1998, and the highlands of Amhara beginning in late 1999, covering 500 and 434 households, respectively. The household survey includes informatio n on household endowments, land, labor, education, livestock and other assets; access to factors of production and credit, income sources, and livelihood strategies. The plot level survey contains information on plot level factors including plot quality characteristics (soil type, slope, size), land tenure, land investments, land management practices, inputs used (fertilizers, seeds, herbicides, insecticides), yields, and erosion indicators. The community survey covers topics on market access, population, irrigation programs and organizations; local prices of crops, livestock and livestock products; community natural resource management, land use and land tenure.

N2  - Increased resistance to insecticides and established drugs by malaria vectors necessitate the search for alternative cost-effective malaria control tools in the Ethiopia. Traditional remedies are the most important source of therapeutics of the population and more than 85% of the traditional medical preparations in Ethiopia are of plant origin. As the Ethiopian indigenous medicinal plants&#39; knowledge and diversity is vulnerable to be lost continuous documentation and preservation of traditional knowledge and the plant species is a priority. Thus, we report an ethnobotanical survey of plants traditionally used for malaria prevention and treatment in an indigenous villages of Tepi town south western Ethiopia. To document anti-malarial plant traditional knowledge and determine level of utilization for prevention and treatment of malaria by households, 40 household heads were surveyed by snow ball sampling of which eight household heads addressed by systematic purposive sampling were traditional healers. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews and were analyzed using SPSS version 20. A total of twenty five plant species belonging to twenty two families have been reported. The most cited plant species for malaria prevention by healers were Cyperus species (52.11%), Allium sativum L. (24.15%), Lepidium sativum L. (9.34%) and Echinops kebericho Mesfin. (7.82%). This study has documented more anti-malarial plant species to be used in the indigenous village. The existing medicinal plant species and the indigenous knowledge on traditional medicinal plants in the study area were under serious threat and were at risk of getting lost. Therefore, urgently warrant sustainable conservation and further research is needed. Key words: Indigenous knowledge, malaria vectors, medicinal plants. &nbsp

N2  - Background: Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) belongs to the family Solanaceae. In Ethiopia, control of early blight is largely dependent on fungicidal application. There is a research need to identify effective botanical extracts to control Alternaria solani that cause early blight of tomato and for evaluation of plant extracts through different solvents on the target pathogen. Methods: In vitro experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of crude extracts of 16 selected medicinal plants against Alternaria solani. Thus, crude extracts were extracted from medicinal plants with different solvents (methanol, ethanol and petroleum at (25%, 50% and 100%) concentrations. The Alternaria solani was isolated from infected tomato leaves showing early blight symptoms. Evaluation of plant extracts was carried out against Alternaria solani using food poisoned technique on PDA. Result: Results showed that most of the methanolic extract plants were showed significant inhibition of the mycelial growth as compared to ethanolic and petroleum ether extracts. A higher rate of mycelial reduction was recorded by ethanol extracts of Allium sativum at all concentrations (100%) followed by methanol extracts of Allium sativum at 25%, 50%, 100% concentration (90.02%, 97.01%, 100% respectively). The effectiveness of extracts against Alternaria solani depends on use at the higher concentrations and various solvents. For crude extracts that have shown higher inhibitory effects against Alternaria solani in vitro conditions, actual chemical compounds should be identified. Furthermore, it is also important to evaluate these plants on other microbes, study to test in vivo and to assess their real potential field condition wherever early blight is an important disease of tomato.

N2  - Spodoptera frugiperda, also known as the fall armyworm (FAW), is a polyphagous, destructive, and internationally dispersed insect pest that poses a serious danger to the production of cereals in Africa. Entomopathogens are a safe and environmentally beneficial way to control insect infestations when the all types of insecticides being used to control FAW are linked to a range of serious human health problems from respiratory to cancer. The objective of this study was to identify fungi from local soil that were effective against S. frugiperda larvae. Aluminum foil was used to gather soil samples from various maize growing regions in Ethiopia. Fungi isolated from soil samples and suspended conidia preparation was done in the mycology lab of Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia. At Melkasa Agricultural Research Center a bioassay test was conducted on S. frugiperda larvae. Three replications and a fully randomized design was used to set up the six treatments for the experiment. Twenty FAW larvae (3rd instar) were put into sterile Petri dishes with a diameter of 9 cm and a filter paper lining. A new, unopened syringe was used to inject 3 ml of the suspended solution into each treatment. As a negative control, distilled and sterilized water was used. FAW larval mortality was measured and examined independently for each treatment using GLM, followed by a Tukey's HSD post-hoc test. The cumulative mortality rate (P = 0.0001) and second-day mortality rate (P = 0.001) showed a significant difference between regimens. These noteworthy variations were seen in third instar larvae. S. frugiperda larvae from isolation fungi F1 and F5 had the highest (96.67%) and lowest (80.0%) mean cumulative death rates. Under negative control, the mean cumulative mortality rate was 8.33%. The outcomes showed that S. frugiperda could potentially be controlled by fungal isolates found in maize fields. Conidial concentration, as well as field evaluation, characterisation, and species identification of isolate fungi, all require more study.

N2  - The study was conducted with the objective of to evaluate the potential effects of widely used agro-chemicals on the health status of Apis mellifera scutllata in Sidama zone, Southern Ethiopia. Seven different agro-chemicals (2, 4-D, Agrothoate 40% Malathion 50%, pyriban48%, Diazinon 60%, Macozeb 80% and Pallas 45 OD) were commonly applied on various crops in the study area. The acute toxicity of these agro-chemicals to honeybees was tested via feeding, contact and fumigation. The mortalities caused by individual agro-chemical were compared with positive control Agro-thoate40% (Diamethoate) and negative control (honey solution and water). Acute toxicity analysis in the laboratory indicated that all tested agro-chemicals were found significantly toxic to A.m. scuttlata compared to negative control via feeding. Agrothoate 40%, Malathion50% EC and Dianznon 60% were highly toxic with 100% of experimental bee mortality, less than an hour. All agro-chemicals were statically significant toxic to honeybee when compared (P<0.01) standard insecticides and control group through all exposure rout. Therefore, proper utilization agro-chemicals are important to minimize poisoning of honeybee.

N2  - To evaluate the berries of Phytolacca dodecandra (P. dodecandra) for its effect on Histoplasma capsulatum var. farciminosum (HCF) and for the treatment of cases of epizootic lymphangitis (EL). Samples were collected from un-ruptured nodules of cases of EL at Debre Zeit and Akaki (central Ethiopia). Mycological culture and isolation of HCF were performed at the Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology. Phytochemical screening was done for n-butanol extract of P. dodecandra to detect alkaloids, saponins, phenolic compounds and flavonoids. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) of aqueous and n-butanol extracts of P. dodecandra against HCF were determined by agar dilution assay. For the in vivo trial, 5% simple ointment was prepared from n-butanol extract and applied topically to 24 (twelve early and twelve moderate) cases of EL. Phytochemical screening showed that n-butanol extract of P. dodecandra was positive for alkaloids, saponins and phenolic compounds but negative for flavonoids. The MICs of n-butanol and aqueous extracts of P. dodecandra were (0.039%–0.078%) and (0.625%–1.250%), respectively. The MFCs of n-butanol and aqueous extracts of P. dodecandra were (0.078%–0.156%) and (1.250%–2.500%), respectively. The MIC and MFC of ketoconazole (positive control) was (1.200×10−5%–2.500×10−5%) and (5.000×10−5%–1.000×10−4%), respectively while growth was observed on free medium (negative control). From the total of 24 treated cases of EL, 14 (58.3%) responded to treatment; however, 10 (41.7%) did not respond to treatment. There was no significant difference in the degree of response to treatment between early and moderate cases (χ2=0.686; P=0.408). It can be concluded that n-butanol extract of P. dodecandra demonstrates antifungal effects while the aqueous extract shows no antifungal activity.

N2  - Field studies were conducted for two consecutive years (2013 and 2014) to determine the effectiveness of different plant extracts and synthetic chemical insecticides for the control of onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) at Adigudom, Southern Tigray, Ethiopia. Two chemical insecticides including dimethoate 40% E.C and Lambda-cyhalothrin (Karate 5 EC), and five botanical extracts obtained from neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss), Mexican marigold (Tagetus minuta L.), tree tobacco (Nicotiana glauca Graham) and Jimson weed (Datura stramonium L.) were tested for their controlling effect on onion thrips. The population dynamics of the thrips was monitored and population counts were made before and after the application of each of the treatments. The two years combined analysis indicated that there was a significant difference (p<0.05) in onion bulb yield where dimethoate, Tree tobacco, Karate, and Mexican marigold recorded significantly higher onion bulb yield than the control. Thirty and 37% more bulb yield was obtained in the Tree tobacco and dimethoate treated plots than in the control. Karate has had the highest effect in reducing thrips pest population in year one, though was on par with that of dimethoate, did well in the second year contributing to significant yield improvement against the control. There was no statistically significant difference among treatments in plant height, leaf number and bulb weight. From among the botanicals tested, tree tobacco had the best performance in controlling onion thrips and was comparable to those of dimethoate and Karate.Keywords: Onion thrips, Thrips tabaci, Botanical insecticide, Chemical insecticide, Ecofriendly, Gum Selassa, Adigudem, Tigray, Ethiopia.

N2  - Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the most important staple food crops in the highlands of Ethiopia. However, the production and productivity of barley are constrained by various a biotic and biotic stresses. Among the biotic stresses, barley net blotch and leaf rust are the most destructive diseases of barley. The field experiment was conducted at three locations (Sinana, Robe and Goba) for two consecutive years (2017 and 2018) crop growing seasons. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different fungicides for the management of barley net blotch and leaf rust diseases. Treatments were composed of one highly susceptible barley variety (Guta) to major barley diseases and seven systemic foliar fungicides (Tilt250EC (PropiconazoleEC), RexDuo (Epoxiconazole+Thiophanatemethyl), AmistarXtra280SC (Azoxystrodin+Cyproconazole), OperaMax (F500 (85G/L)) (Pyraclostrobin+Epoxiconazole), Natura250EC (Tebuconazole250EC), Nativo300SC (Tebuconazole50%+Trifloxystrobin75WG), Artea330EC (Propiconazole+Cyproconazole) and untreated plot (control) were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The present study revealed that Tilt 250 EC and Artea 330 EC fungicides provided significant grain yield increment over untreated plot (control) across the three sites. The highest grain yield obtained from plots treated by Tilt 250 EC (2778.9 kgha<sup>-1</sup>) and Artea 330 EC (2538.9 kgha<sup>-1</sup>), which was 40% and 35% higher than the untreated control, respectively. The most effective among all tested fungicides, Artea 330 EC and Tilt 250 EC applied at the rate of 0.5 litre per hectare which reached 98.63% and 94.54% efficacy in controlling barley rust disease, respectively. Likewise, Tilt 250 EC and Artea 330 EC also relatively reduced net blotch disease severity to the lowest level. Likely, Tilt 250 EC and Artea 330 EC revealed that 11.4 quintal ha<sup>-1</sup> and 9 quintal ha<sup>-1</sup> yield advantage over untreated plot (control). The highest net benefit obtained from the application of Tilt 250 EC followed by Artea 330 EC fungicides as compared to the untreated plot. The application of Tilt 250 EC and Artea 330 EC fungicides gave maximum economic profitability with an attractive acceptable return to control leaf rust and a net blotch of barley. One time application of Tilt 250 EC and Artea 330 EC fungicides is the most effective in controlling barley leaf rust and net blotch diseases at the time of disease appearance.

N2  - Barley ranks fourth among the cereals in both yield and hectare coverage at global level next to wheat, rice and maize. Net blotch is one of the most important barley diseases which reduce both quality and quantity of barley grain. Currently, the disease can be controlled using different approaches. The aim of this work is to test the effectiveness of different fungicides. Progress 250 EC, Rexdou, Tilt 250 EC, Skyway Xpro EC 275 and Zantara EC 216 against net blotch of barley disease compared to unsprayed control. The experiment was conducted in west Showa Zone at the site which is well known as net blotch disease hot spot. The experiment was conducted on plots of 25 m2. The results showed that, significant (P<0.05) difference among treatments. Skyway Xpro EC 275 fungicide reduced the incidence, severity, grain yield loss, by 79.78, 88.98 and 49.97%, over fungicide unsprayed treatments, respectively. Zantara EC 216 was second most effective fungicide to reduced disease incidence, severity, grain yield loss, and dry biomass loss by 57.33, 75.58, 36.21, and 38.11%, respectively. However, there was no significant difference among Progress 250 EC, Rex dou and Tilt250 EC fungicides. The Effectiveness of Skyway Xpro EC 275 and Zantara EC 216 for the control of barley net blotch disease revealed 18.88 q/ha and 10.73 q/ha, respectively, compared to fungicide unsprayed treatment. The grain yield and dry biomass obtained from plots treated by the fungicides were higher compare to fungicide unsprayed plot. It is evident that, the newly introduced fungicides (Skyway XproEC 275 and Zantara EC216) control the net blotch disease of barley effectively compared to the previously used fungicides under Ethiopian condition. Therefore, those fungicides recommended for barley net blotch disease management practices as foliar application.

N2  - <ns3:p>Background Termites are a major insect pest affecting agricultural production and woody materials. They cause severe devastation in the ecosystem, and lead to bare soil. This phenomenon causes the soil to become difficult to plow, which in turn leads to a reduction in the productivity of crops. It can cause 100 % yield losses based on crop types, level of the damage, and size of its populations. To manage this pest, different management options have been evaluated in Ethiopia. While insecticide usage is the dominant option, less attention has been given to Entomopathogenic Nematode (EPN) based management options. Therefore, this research was initiated to screen locally collected EPN isolates and evaluate promising isolates under field conditions on maize crop. Methods 37 EPN isolates were screened under laboratory condition, while two isolates were evaluated at field condition. The screening of EPN isolates was laid out in a completely randomized design, and the field evaluation used a completely randomized block design, and treatments were replicated thrice. Mortality of insect, damaged root, stem, cob, damage severity, foraging termites, and yield of the crop data were collected. Results The study indicated that all screened EPN isolates caused mortality on termites under laboratory conditions. The isolates achieved complete mortality of the insect pest within 12 days of exposure. The finding indicated that AEH and S#50 were the more pathogenic and virulent isolates on termites under laboratory conditions and taken to field study. The S#50 isolate was most pathogenic and reduced the infestation and severity of the insect pest on the maize crop under field conditions. Conclusions This result showed that the entomopathogenic nematode isolates have the potential to manage subterranean termites in the maize field. Future studies should be based on collection of local isolates and develop a full package for the virulent isolates.</ns3:p>

Mortality of insect, damaged root, stem, cob, damage severity, foraging termites, and yield of the crop data were collected. Results The study indicated that all screened EPN isolates caused mortality on termites under laboratory conditions. The isolates achieved complete mortality of the insect pest within 12 days of exposure. The finding indicated that AEH and S#50 were the more pathogenic and virulent isolates on termites under laboratory conditions and taken to field study. The S#50 isolate was most pathogenic and reduced the infestation and severity of the insect pest on the maize crop under field conditions. Conclusions This result showed that the entomopathogenic nematode isolates have the potential to manage subterranean termites in the maize field. Future studies should be based on collection of local isolates and develop a full package for the virulent isolates.</ns4:p>

N2  - Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) is an important fruit crop in the daily diet, good source of food nutrients, cash to the farmers. The leaf and fruit spot disease caused by Phaeoramularia angolensis is one of the most devastating airborne diseases and also the main constraints contributing to the low productivity of citrus plantation in 20 African countries including Ethiopia. The experiment was conducted to evaluate three fungicide (Unizeb 80% WP, Trust-cymocop 439.5 WP, and Benomyl 500 WP) and combination of the two each fungicide under field conditions for the management of leaf and fruit spot disease and also to assess the yield losses. Not significant different in disease incidence between treatments and there was a significant difference in the leaf and fruit spot disease severity and Area under Disease Progressive Curve (AUDPC) among treatments. On the final date of disease assessment, among the fungicide, Unizeb sprayed was recorded the lowest disease severity (17.33%) and (18.17%), whereas the highest disease severity of (46.67%) and (45.83 %) were recorded on leaf and fruit spot on control plots, respectively. The highest fruit yield of 6.14 and 5.94 t/ha were also recorded from plots sprayed with Unizeb 80% WP and Benomyl 500 WP fungicide. Unizeb 80% WP fungicide applied exhibited maximum partial cost net benefit from all plots that means the highest (123970.00 ETB ha -1 ) was recorded and followed by Benomyl 500 WP (111520.00 ETB ha -1 ) fungicide treated plots. The results of the present study revealed that the novel possibility of using Unizeb foliar spray with four times which was found to be an effective in decreasing leaf and fruit spot disease symptoms on sweet orange in Kellem Wollega, Western Oromiya and increased yield.

N2  - Leaf and fruit spot (Pseudocercospora angolensis) disease of citrus attacks leaves, fruits, and young twigs of the plant. The disease can cause a yield loss of (50% to 100%) in areas with high rainfall and humidity during the active growth stages of the crop. Currently, citrus plantations in the south, south-west and north-west of Ethiopia are seriously affected by this disease. As a result, this study was proposed to study the effect of fungicides in controlling. And candidate fungicides were: Carbonchlor 50% SC only, Benline 50% WP only, Bellis 38% WG only, Carbonchlor 50% SC combined with Bellis 38% WG, Benline 50% WP combined with Carbonchlor 50% SC and Benline 50% WP combined with Matco 72% WP for effective management of citrus leaf and fruit spot (Pseudocercospra angolensis) disease. The study was carried out in 2021 cropping season. A Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications was the design applied. The result showed that the highest level of efficacy (90.46%) was produced by Bellis 38% WG fungicide followed by Carbonchlor 50% SC (86.50%), Bellis 38% WG + Carbonchlor 50% SC (82.00%), Carbonchlor 50% SC + Benline 50% WP (67.89%), Benline 50% WP (65.62%) and Matco 72% WP + Benline 50% WP (49.48%). Therefore, based on the outcome of the study application of Bellis 38% WG only followed by Carbonchlor 50% SC only, Carbonchlor 50% SC combined with Benline 50% WP, Bellis 38% WG combined with Carbonchlor 50% SC, Bellis 38% WG only, Benline 50% WP only and Matco 72% WP combined with Benline 50% WP were effective fungicides to be used for the control of leaf and fruit spot disease.

N2  - A field experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2018 to evaluate effective and economical integrated management package for the control of Raphanus raphanistrum in faba bean in Waliso District of South West Shoa, Ethiopia. The experimental design used was spilt plot design with two levels of plowing frequency assigned as main plot and eight weed management practice as sub plot in three replications. Data recorded on crop and weed related parameters. Results obtained indicated that the interaction effect of plowing frequency and combination of herbicides with hand weeding frequency significantly affected plant height, number of pods per plant, seeds per pod, crop biomass and grain yield of faba bean. The highest mean grain yield (1541 kg/ha) was obtained from the interaction effect of plowing three times with application of pendimethalin at 3 lt ha -1 supplemented with once hand weeding at 30-35 days after sowing. This is followed by plowing three times and application of S-Metolachlor at 1 litter ha -1 supplemented with twice hand weeding at 30-35 and 50-55 days after sowing that gave a mean grain yields of 1463kg/ha. The interaction effect of plowing frequency and combination of herbicides with hand weeding frequency also significantly affected the weed population, weed plant height and biomass. The lowest R. raphanistrum population, height and biomass was obtained from the interaction of three times plowing and application of S-metolachlor at 1 litter ha -1 supplemented with twice hand weeding at 30-35 and 50-55 days after sowing. Economic analysis showed that trice plowing combined with application of Pendimethalin at 3 lt ha -1 supplemented by once hand weeding at 30-35 days after sowing gave the highest Net benefit (23174 birr) followed by three times plowing combined with application S-Metolachlor at 1 lt ha -1 supplemented by twice hand weeding. Therefore, three times plowing and application of S-Metolachlor herbicide supplemented by twice hand weeding at 30-35 and 50-55 DAS or three times plowing and application of Pendimethalin herbicide at 3 lt ha -1 supplemented with one time hand weeding at 30-35 DAS is recommended for economic control of R. raphanistrum in faba bean production.

N2  - Abstract Background: Malaria is a leading public health problem in Ethiopia despite the implementation of effective indoor vector control strategies over several decades. Vector control operations in the country largely depend on the application of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) of synthetic insecticides and Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) which resulted in a significant reduction in the malaria burden. The spread of resistance to insecticides in these indoor vector control tools in vector species is a serious challenge. Alternatively, reports indicate that botanicals which are relatively safe possess toxic compounds with high larvicidal activities. However, there are limited evidences on the larvicidal effect of botanicals against the malaria vectors, Anopheles arabiensis . This study aimed to evaluate the larvicidal activities of the extracts of the roots, stems, and leaves of Parthenium hysterophorus against the 4 th instar larvae of An. arabiensis . Methods: Field collected leaves, stems and root parts of P. hysterophorus were dried and separately ground to powder and extracted in petroleum ether, hexane, acetone, and ethanol solvents. The extracts were concentrated using a Rota evaporator, and stock solutions were subject to serial dilutions for use as test concentrations. Laboratory reared 4 th instar larvae of An. arabiensis were used for the larvicidal bioassays. Mortality data were subjected probit analysis to determine LC 50 and LC 90 of the extracts. Results: The results showed that there were significant differences in percentage larval mortalities (P&lt;0.05) among different concentrations of the leaf, stem, and root solvent extracts, respectively. Hexane extracts of leaves and stem of P. hysterophorus at 480ppm caused the highest mortality of 4 th larval instar of An. arabiensis (85% and 96.7%, respectively) compared to those of ethanolic, acetone, and petroleum ether extracts of these plant parts. Petroleum ether extracts of the root of P. hysterophorus were the most effective in causing very high larval mortality at 360ppm and 480ppm (98.3%). The LC 50 value of petroleum ether root extract (10.7ppm) and LC 90 value of petroleum ether root extract (105.5ppm) were significantly lower than those of ethanol, acetone, and hexane root extracts, respectively. Conclusion: Petroleum ether root extract of P. hysterophorus has remarkably high larvicidal potential against 4 th instar larvae of An. arabiensis which could be exploited for malaria vector control. Further studies on the larvicidal efficacy of the extracts under field conditions and identification of the bioactive components in the root parts of this weed plant are recommended.

N2  - Root-knot nematodes (RKN), Meloidogyne incognita are important pests and major limiting factors for the production of tomato in Ethiopia. Recently, the most efficient chemical control products like methyl bromide have now been restricted due to their toxic characteristics. Biopesticides were evaluated against root-knot nematode, Meloidogne incognita on tomato plants in laboratory and green house conditions of Haramaya University (Ethiopia). The study was conducted with the objectives to evaluate the e ect of some biocontrols i.e. Bacillus firmus, Trichoderma harzianum, neem seed (Azadirachta indica), garlic bulb (Allium sativum) on M. incognita and to compare the potentials of biocontrols for the management of root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) on tomato. These biologically active factors exhibit the property to resist against M. incognita. Different concentrations for each treatments were used and analysis for the efficiency of bio pesticides was made effect of these concentrations were perceived on egg hatchability, gall formation, number of eggs, final nematode population, plant height, reproduction factor, shoot and root weight. In laboratory tests, an aqueous suspension of bio pesticides at 1, 2, 3 and 4% concentration reduced egg hatching from 8.4 to 100 %, 24 -days after treatment. In green house trials, Bacillus firmus applied at 4 % concentration per pot reduced gall formation by 85.7 %, number of eggs and final nematode population by 37 and 72 %, consequently, improvement of plant height and shoot height was by 51.5 and 55.6 %, respectively as compared to the inoculated control, 50 days after treatment. Application of garlic bulb (Allium sativum) at 4 % concentration per pot reduced gall formation by 77 %, number of eggs and final nematode population by 28 and 61.5 %, respectively. Findings illustrated that the tested bio agents and botanicals were effective for managing root-knot nematodes, M. incognita. However, Bacillus firmus and Trichoderma harzianum revealed their potentials more than neem seed (Azadirachta indica) and garlic bulb (Allium sativum) for managing M. incognita. Thus, they seem to be effective for the management of root- knot nematode and has the potential to be a vital component of integrated management for root-knot nematode.Keywords: B. firmus, T. harzianum, A. indica, A. sativum, M. incognita, Tomato, Root-knot nematodes

N2  - Wheat is one of the most important food security crops that cultivated from small to large scale farms in Ethiopia. However, its productivity has been limited due to various abiotic and biotic factors including weeds. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of post emergence herbicides application on weed management and productivity of wheat. Four types of herbicides 2,4-D1lt ha -1 , Pyroxulam 0.5lt ha -1 , Florasulam 100ml ha -1 and Florasulam+ Amirpyrolid 33gm ha -1 along with control a weedy check were laid out in Randomized Completely Block Design with three replications. A total of identified 12 weed species were recorded 86 % broad and 14 % grass weeds. Relative weed density also indicated that the field was highly infested by Galinsoga pulviflora Cav . but the lowest infestation of Guizotia scabra (Vis) Chiov was recorded in the field. Results also revealed that significant effects of post emergence herbicides application for all the traits studied except number of seeds per spike. The minimum dry biomass weeds (88.33 kg ha -1 ) and the highest weed control efficiency (78.60%) were recorded from the Pyroxulam. The highest number of productive tillers (133.33m -2 ), stand count(414.33 m -2 ),seeds per spike (76.48), thousand grain weight (42.60g), grain yield (4346.58 kgha -1 ) and biological yield (12100kg ha -1 ) were recorded from Pyroxulam while the lowest values were observed from the weedy check. Therefore, it can be concluded that Pyroxulam effectively managed weeds and gave maximum yield which could be recommended for the test environment. Since the experiment was conducted in one location and for single season, it should be repeated over seasons or multi locations for best recommendation.

N2  - Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) production is severely reduced by Fusarium wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceris (Foc) in most chickpea growing areas worldwide. The effect of treating chickpea seeds with three bacterial strains of Bacillus and two strains of Pseudomonas to control wilt caused by this pathogen was carried out in plots under field conditions. The Bacillus strains had much better effect than Pseudomonas strains on plants health. Bacillus strain (K3) significantly increased seed germination, plant weight, number of pods and the yield. These were increased by (12, 21.2, 39.8 and 14.2%) respectively. Also, the strain B. amyloliquefaciens (5113) showed significantly increases of plant weight, number of pods and the yield (19.6, 19.9 and 10.1%) respectively. It can be concluded that bacterial seed coating combined with other control strategies as integrated pest management could be used successfully to control or at least decrease the effect of Fusarium wilt on chickpea production.

N2  - Termites are most pestiferous insects causing damage to crop and buildings. Their control still relies mainly on harmful chemical pesticides to the detriment of eco-friendly pesticides. The main objective of the study was evaluate seed extracts of Brassica nigra and leaves extracts of Acokantra schimperi, Croton macrostachyus and Rhamnus prinoides against Macrotermes subhyalinus, known to cause damage to crops, vegetation and buildings in Ethiopia. Treatments were consisted of three concentrations levels (5, 10 and 15 weight of botanical powder (g) per 100 ml volume of water) by three replications. Mortality of termite was counted after 24, 48 and 72 hours exposure for both conditions. The results of all botanical extracts at all concentration levels showed that caused mortality of M. subhyalinus workers. Complete mortality (100%) of M. subhyalinus was observed after treatment with 15 w/v B. nigra extract at three time intervals. Moreover, A. schimperi at 15 w/v concentration also resulted 100% mortality after 48-72 hours of exposure. Brassica nigra extract showed least LC50 (5.63g/100ml) value than other botanical extracts after 24 hours exposure. Based on their toxicity status extracts of B. nigra > A. schmperi > R. prinoides > C. macrostachyus leaf extracts.

N2  - Soil -borne plant pathogens cause heavy losses to all major crops, leading to reductions in both yield and quality. Soil solarisation and bio- fumigation offer disease management options that are safe and reduce the use of pesticides for soil -borne plant pathogens. Mustard plant releases antimicrobial hydrolysis products, notably isothiocyanates when used as a bio- fumigant. Bacterial spot of tomato caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) can survive in soil and plant debris, which serve as a primary inoculum for infecting the next tomato crop. An experiment was carried out with the objective of evaluating effects of soil solarisation and the use of Ethiopian mustard ( Brassica carinata A. Braun) as a bio -fumigant to control bacterial spot disease and on yield of tomato. The tr eatments consisted of six types of potted soil medium (solarised at Haramaya and Dire Dawa, bio -fumigated, biofumigated as well as solarised at Haramaya and Dire Dawa, and untreated control as non- solarised non- biofumigated pots). Treated tomato seeds were planted and fruit yields were compared among treatments. Potted soil was inoculated with the pathogen, Xcv, belonging to T2P2 race group. The total microbial and Xcv counts were done before as well as after setting up the experiment. The results revealed that solarisation reduced the population of Xcv from 10.68 to 8.79 CFU g -1 , total bacterial population from 11.27 to 9.86 CFU g -1 , and total actinomycete counts from 11.69 to 9.44 CFU g -1 while bio -fumigation had a non- significant effect on Xcv and total microbial counts. None of the treatments exhibited a significant effect on fungal counts. The fruit yield of tomato grown on biofumigated as well as solarised soil was the highest (91.18 t ha -1 ) as compared to the other treatments. It can, therefore, be con cluded that solarisation and bio- fumigation cannot be used as a bio- rational option for effective management of Xcv on tomato but the two methods could be used to increase tomato yield in the presence of the pathogen.

N2  - Striga is the major sorghum production constraints in western Tigray, Ethiopia. Three Striga sick plot locations (Rawyan, Adebay and Beaker Kebeles) were selected during 2019 main cropping season. The objective of the study was to evaluate the Striga suppression effect of Chlorsulfuron 75% WDG (Turkey and china) product herbicides on sorghum. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications and ten (10gram/hectare) Chlorsulfuron 75% WDG were diluted in water and applied three weeks after planting. Striga count at 60 days after planting, at harvesting and grain yield were recorded and analyzed using GenStat 18version. The treatments showed statistically significant difference (p<001) in Striga and grain yield. But, there was no significant variation between the tested herbicides. The highest Striga count (1602.3/plot) was recorded from control followed by china product (365/plot) and turkey (303.3). The highest mean Striga reduction (81.07%) was recorded from Turkey followed by china (77.22%). The highest Striga count was recorded in Adebay (1298.33) followed by Rawyan (631.33) and Beaker (345).17.98 quintal/hectare, 16.11 and 9.55 yield was recorded in Rawyan, beaker and Adebay respectively The highest grain yield 18.33 quintal/hectare was recorded from Turkey product which is 50.19% yield advantage, 16.48 quintal/hectare 44.6% yield advantage in china product while 9.13quintal/hectare from control. From the study result recommended that both the Turkey and china product herbicides will be promoted to further demonstration and popularization at farm level.

N2  - The average grain yield is low (at 1.75tha<sup>-1</sup>). Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the adoption of improved tef practices impacting yield and factors affecting the adoption of the improved agricultural practice in four regions of Ethiopia. Household surveys and crop cut surveys were used. Four districts, 101 each in Amhara, SNNP, Tigray, and 100 farmers in Oromia regions of Ethiopia were assessed in the study. Therefore, a total of 403 respondent farmers, were used. Data were analysed using SSPS. Among the seven improved agricultural practices assessed, fertilizer application, variety selection, and use, land preparation, and herbicide application showed higher adoption among the farmers. The correlation analysis results revealed that yield is positively and significantly correlated with land preparation (r=0.492), row planting (r=0.351) hand weeding (0.306), fertilizer application (r=0.143). This implies that the adoptions of these improved practices were contributing to yield increment. The result clearly indicated that the adoption of improved practices was influenced by a composite of demographic, socio-economic, and institutional factors. The partial budget analysis was employed using previous variable cost data collected in the Ada district by Debre Zeit Agricultural Research Centre. The result revealed that the highest increased income showed in Lume districts (positive net change in benefits) 37,431.2 birr ha<sup>-1</sup> followed by Siyadebirenawayu districts which were 31,131.73 birr ha<sup>-1</sup>. However, the increased income in Lemo and Lalye Maychew were minima l9513.34 birr ha<sup>-1</sup> and 11,469.95 birrs ha<sup>-1</sup> respectively. The benefit-cost ratio for Lume and Siyadebir enawayu districts were 3.9 and 3.3, respectively. However, the benefit-cost ratio for Lemo and Lalye Maychew were 1.7 and 1.9, respectively. The variables significantly affect the adoption of tef improved practices by farmers were age, education level, family size, farm size, extension service provision. To solve problems of inadequate use of improved practices, Development Agents and Agricultural experts should provide farmers with more practical pieces of training under farmers’ direct participation in the demonstration centres. In order to attain food security, the nation policymakers should devise more effective farmers’ training mechanisms and provide more applicable tef production mechanizations effective on the process of tef production.

N2  - <title>Abstract</title> <bold>Background</bold>: The main tools for the control of malaria vectors in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Ethiopia are long lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying. However, the sustainability of IRS and ITNs is threatened by the emergence of insecticide resistances, behavioral avoidance, as well as presence of outdoor biting mosquito populations. Thus, complementary interventions such as larval source management (LSM), which includes larviciding, are required to achieve better result in malaria vector control. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of three larvicides (Aquatain AMF®, temephos and <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis </italic>(<italic>Bti</italic>) against larvae of <italic>Anopheles arabiensisi</italic> and <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. <bold>Method</bold>: The tests were conducted in the laboratory and in semi-natural habitats on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> larval instars of both insectary-reared and wild-collected immature <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, respectively. For the field study, larvae were collected from three sites (Awash Sebat Kilo, Metahara and Adama towns). Three productive larval habitats in three villages were treated with Aquatain, temephos and <italic>Bti</italic>, and compared with untreated habitats (control). <bold>Results</bold>: In the laboratory, the percent mortality ranged 95% to 100% and 60% to 100% for <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> and <italic>An. stephensi</italic> colonies, respectively, while the percent larval mortality ranged 97% to 100% and 74% to 100% for field collected wild <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> and <italic>An. stephensi,</italic> respectively. In the natural field study, the percent immature stages reductions ranged 84% - 96%, 89% - 95% and 77% - 96% at Awash, Metahara and Adama respectively. The three larvicides (Aquatain, Temephos and <italic>Bti</italic>) clearly showed high larviciding efficacies both in the laboratory and field evaluations. Despite its efficacy, temephos changed the color of the water to whitish and has got strong smell. As a result, the community scared of the treated habitats. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: It is highly recommendable that Aquatain and/or <italic>Bti </italic>larvicides be used in malaria control program as complementary malaria vector control tools.

N2  - The study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of integrated management of bean anthracnose through soil solarization and various fungicides applications on epidemics of the disease and to determine the effect of integrated management of bean anthracnose on seed yield and loss of common bean variety Mexican-142. Field experiments were conducted at Haramaya and Hirna in 2010 main cropping season of Ethiopia. Soil solarization was integrated with mancozeb and carbendazim seed treatment and with foliar sprays of carbendazim at the rate of 0.5 kg/ha at 10 and 20 days intervals. The experiment was arranged in 2 &times; 3 &times; 3 split-split plot design with three replications. A total of 18 treatments were evaluated. There was a significant difference in the anthracnose incidence, severity, seed yield and yield loss. At Haramaya, severe epidemics of anthracnose developed. Seed treatments, foliar sprays and soil solarization alone as well as their interactions did not significantly affect pods per plant and seeds per pod at both locations. The combinations of solarized soil + mancozeb seed treatment + carbendazim foliar spray at 10 days intervals produced seed yield of 3.8 t ha-1 at Haramaya and 3.6 t ha-1 at Hirna over the control. Integrations of soil solarization, seed treatments and foliar spray were found to be effective in reducing bean anthracnose epidemics and increasing yield. Key words: Carbendazim, foliar spray, Mancozeb, Phaseolus vulgaris, seed treatment.

N2  - Garlic (Allium sativum L.) is the second most widely cultivated vegetables next to onion in Ethiopia and mainly produced for its medicinal and nutritional purpose white rot caused by a soil borne fungus (Sclerotium cepivorum Berk.) is a major production threat of garlic where ever the crop is grown. Therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of fungicides, and garlic varieties against garlic white rot in West Shewa, Ethiopia. The field experiment was conducted at Ambo University, Gudar campus experimental field in 2018/2019 cropping season, arranged in 5 x 3 factorial treatment combination of five varieties namely Holeta, Chefe, Tseday (G-493), kuriftu and local cultiver (as check) and two fungicides namely Pro-seed plus 63 WS and Tebuconazole (Natura 250 EW) along with the untreated control plots in randomized complete block design with three replications. Garlic cloves were treated using fungicides before planting. A total of fifteen treatments were evaluated per replication. Two fungicides were effective in reducing the disease epidemics and improving garlic yield over untreated plots. However, among fungicides used, plots treated with Pro-seed plus was the most effective in reducing the disease epidemics and gave better yield advantage. Pro-seed plus 63 Ws treated plots 57.12 %, 35 % and 64.25 % reduced initial, final incidence and final severity was recorded respectively as compared to untreated plots. The results showed significantly highest marketable yield was recorded from Tseday varieties treated with Pro-seed plus 63 WS (3.047t ha-1) followed by Kuriftu varieties treated with the same fungicides (2.973t ha-1) compared to the untreated control plots. Significantly, higher net profit was obtained from Pro-seed plus 63WS treated varieties compared to Tebuconazole and untreated control plots. Among the garlic varieties, Tseday (G-493) was promising in reducing the disease epidemics and gave better total and marketable bulb yield. Further research should be conducted with the same varieties combinations with fungicides against white rot under multi locations and in different seasons.

N2  - Determining the evolutionary mechanisms, genomic outcomes and functional consequences of adaptation is of paramount importance for our understanding of the nature of evolution, and for predicting the evolutionary responses of organisms in the face of the current and future global changes. Microorganisms which are associated with humans (as members of the human microbiome, or associated with domesticated plants or animals) provide ideal models to study adaptation and specialisation. These microbes are diverse and many possess outstanding experimental assets, such as small genomes and membership in relatively simple multi-species communities (Gladieux et al., 2014; Rosshart et al., 2019; Seybold et al., 2020). In addition, studying microbial evolution in human-associated environments is effective because population genetic processes (i.e. genetic drift and selection) are often strong and recent (Gladieux et al., 2014; Ropars & Giraud, 2022). Furthermore, human-associated microbes often have important impacts on human health as members of our microbiomes, as human pathogens or as associates of food production for crop microbiomes, crop pathogens and domesticated microorganisms (Caron et al., 2021; Chow et al., 2020; Davenport et al., 2017; Fisher et al., 2020; Seybold et al., 2020; Wolfe et al., 2014). This special issue covers a broad range of topics related to the evolutionary ecology of human-associated microbes, with methods ranging from population genetics to metagenomics and evolutionary genomics, as well as complementary field and lab studies (in vitro and in vivo). The study organisms include domesticated microorganisms (fungi and bacteria), microorganisms thriving in anthropic environments, host-associated microbiota, crop pathogens and animal pathogens. Together these articles underline the huge impact of the anthropogenic environment in microbial evolution, including the emergence and spread of pathogens as well as the benefits provided by domesticated or mutualistic fungi and bacteria. The yeast Brettanomyces bruxellensis has adapted to many different anthropic environments, for example, wine, beer, bioethanol production and kombucha. While it can be desired and used as a starter for adding a spicy phenolic note to some beer types, it can also be considered as a spoiler, as it causes unpleasant aromas in wine (e.g. barnyard, horse swear or burnt plastic-like aromas) and a reduction of ethanol yield in bioethanol production. In their review, Harrouard et al. (2023) describe the genetic and phenotypic diversity of this yeast, highlighting the role of polyploidisation and hybridisation as one of the driving mechanisms for the adaptation of B. bruxellensis to various anthropic niches. Some populations of B. bruxellensis may even be considered as domesticated, as beer strains have acquired the ability to metabolise maltose and to produce pleasant aromas. Conversely, other populations are notorious spoilers, such as those producing unpleasant aromas in wine. These populations have adapted to the human-made beverage, having acquired tolerance or resistance against the sulphite added to control endemic non-Saccharomyces yeasts, including B. bruxellensis. Other yeasts have been genuinely domesticated, that is, have evolved specific traits under selection by humans for making better foods or drinks. Genetic differentiation in domesticated yeasts is often driven by geography and ecological niche, as found in B. bruxellensis, S. cerevisiae and Torulaspora delbrueckii (Silva et al., 2023). This latter yeast is associated with winemaking, bread, dairy products and also with natural environments such as soil or plants. The population genomic analyses by Silva et al. (2023) revealed the acquisition of a cluster of GAL genes, associated with galactose metabolism, only in dairy strains, and the expansion and functional diversification of MAL genes associated with maltose metabolism in bread dough strains. This likely represents a genomic footprint of domestication. Fermented products are most often formed by microbial communities (including bacteria, yeasts and sometimes moulds), and not only by inoculated microorganisms. Identifying the origins of microorganisms in such communities is often challenging. von Gastrow et al. (2023) studied the microbial communities in sourdough, a naturally fermented mixture of flour and water for making bread. They used a combination of lab experiments, metabarcoding and participatory research approaches to understand the origin of the microorganisms in sourdough. The core microbiota detected on the seeds and in the flour were mainly composed of microbes known to be associated with plants and were absent in sourdoughs. Conversely, no sourdough yeast species were detected on grains and flours, leaving the origin of sourdough yeasts unresolved. Invasions by fungal plant pathogens represent a significant threat to crop production. Population genome sequencing in Colletotrichum truncatum, an invasive pathogen on soybean in Brazil, revealed three distinct lineages that hybridise one with each other (Rogério et al., 2023); the introgressions involved in particular secreted protein-encoding genes, and may therefore be under selection for host infection (Rogério et al., 2023). Gene flow can indeed foster rapid adaptation. Gene copy-number variation is another type of genomic feature under selection within and between populations. Using comparative genomics and genome wide association, Stalder et al. (2023) found that copy number variants in Rhynchosporium commune, a major pathogen of barley, are enriched in genes related to host exploitation and fungicide resistance. The authors further showed that gene copy-number variation was most often associated with segmental duplication near recently active transposable elements, thus adding to the growing evidence of mobile genetic elements being important players in generating genome variation with adaptive potential. To fight crop pathogens, Saubin et al. (2023) argue that we should bridge gaps between separated fields, in particular between plant breeding, the study of molecular interactions and epidemiology and evolution. This could be achieved using the theoretical framework of population genetics and would provide an integrated view of pathogen adaptation, allowing to optimally manage genetically resistant cultivars. Growing plant varieties carrying resistance genes (R) on large scales in landscapes indeed induces a strong selection on pathogen populations, leading to the rapid evolution of new virulence abilities. This occurred in the poplar rust fungus Melampsora larici-populina with the breakdown of the poplar RMlp7 resistance gene. An unprecedented monitoring across 28 years of the variation at the candidate avirulence gene AvrMlp7 revealed that two avirulent alleles, corresponding to a nonsynonymous mutation and a complete deletion of the locus, occurred before the resistance breakdown event (Louet et al., 2023). This case study therefore represents a major adaptive event from standing variation. Population genetics predicts that diseases should be less frequent in populations of hosts with higher levels of genetic diversity. Genotyping-by-sequencing in Arabica coffee sites in southwestern Ethiopia showed that genetic diversity in coffee trees was higher in less managed sites and the incidence of four major fungal diseases was related to the genetic composition of the coffee stands (Zewdie et al., 2023). Genetic diversity in coffee trees was also related to the within-site variation of coffee berry disease, but not to the mean incidence of any of the four studied diseases across sites (Zewdie et al., 2023). Wang et al. (2023) explored the diversity of pathogenic fungi infecting wheat heads, and belonging to the genus Fusarium. They characterised the diversity of Fusarium species in wheat heads across different geographical regions in China and simultaneously recorded the diversity of mycotoxins produced by these fungi. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by Fusarium that reduce grain quality. The study demonstrates a high species diversity of Fusarium on wheat heads, and moreover shows how this diversity has relevance for the accumulation and diversity of mycotoxins. Interestingly, the diversity of Fusarium species is negatively correlated with mycotoxin accumulation, as elegantly demonstrated in an experiment where single and multi-species Fusarium spore suspensions are inoculated onto wheat heads. The study points to the importance of microbe-microbe interactions in shaping disease development and fungal metabolite production, an observation of great relevance in the context of disease treatment and crop protection. Traditional agrosystems in which disease outbreaks are rare can also help identify sustainable agricultural practices. Genomic and phenotypic analyses of paired samples of rice landraces and strains of the rice blast fungal pathogen (Pyricularia oryzae) in the traditional Yuanyang terraces of flooded rice paddies in China revealed high levels of genetic diversity and a generalist life history in the pathogen (Ali et al., 2023). The traditional agricultural practices with high plant genetic diversity thus likely favoured generalist strategies in the pathogen, which overall reduces the burden of disease. Together, population genetic and genomic studies of pathogens associated with crops demonstrate the exceptional speed whereby pathogens can disperse and adapt. Rapid evolution of pathogens associated with agricultural crops is fuelled by the uniform composition of agricultural monoculture fields. Eco-evolutionary dynamics of microbial communities are strongly impacted by human activities. These interactions can operate on multiple scales. On a broad scale, human activities can cause spatial variation in environments. As a result, humans themselves are exposed to different environments across space and time, and animals in habitats that are close to human settlements may also be exposed to different environments. Yuan et al. (2023) and Pedro et al. (2023) examine how these patterns of spatial environmental variation can affect the microbiome. Yuan et al. (2023) show that human impacts on the habitats of roe deer in China lead to different roe deer diets. These diets are associated with different gut microbiota that appear to be better suited to help the deer process those diets. Similarly, Pedro et al. (2023) show that the human oral microbiome shows geographical patterns in Papua New Guinea. These patterns may be linked to diet/ecology, ancestry, and/or lifestyle. Microbial interactions have a great impact on disease development in humans and animals. MacAlpine et al. (2023) review current literature focused on interactions of bacteria and fungi that colonise humans. Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus are three fungal species which are responsible for most systemic infections in humans. As these fungi colonise different niches of the human body they interact with diverse bacterial communities. Several studies have identified the importance of fungal–bacterial interactions during colonisation and disease development of skin, lungs and the intestinal tract. The nature of these diverse interactions are still poorly understood, however, research into microbial interactions holds a great potential for the discovery of new antimicrobial and antifungal compounds. On a smaller scale, it is also clear that human daily practices can affect microbial communities. Multiple studies in this special issue examine dynamics at this scale, testing between different processes of host–microbe interactions and microbial community assembly while integrating information about specific human behaviours and their impact. Moeller (2023) examines the human gut microbiota using a population approach and finds that antibiotics drive balancing selection in the gut microbiota. This process maintains allelic diversity implicated in drug resistance and is most apparent in industrialised populations. Similarly, Tessandier et al. (2023) test the effect of different types of menstruation protection on the vaginal microbiota. Although they do not find strong patterns, some clustering suggests that different types of protection could lead to vaginal changes that affect the microbiota. Peimbert and Alcaraz (2023) consider human commuter behaviour, reviewing the existing literature on the subway microbiome. They link data describing the built environment and the skin microbiota and emphasise the need for more information about specific human behaviours in the subway (sit/hold/etc., cleaning routine of subways, etc.) and how they affect microbial communities. They also highlight the need for understanding which microbes are pathogenic or not and alive or not to determine health implications. Finally, Bischofberger and Hall (2023) consider human economic behaviour in the context of banknotes and money exchange. They demonstrate that niche-based processes such as local habitat more strongly influence the microbial community of Swiss banknotes than dispersal-based processes like geographic distance. Given that the local habitat of banknotes is affected by human shopping behaviour, and that everyday contact with banknotes could also affect the human microbiota, this study provides an interesting new perspective for considering eco-evolutionary dynamics in the human microbiome. Corsi et al. (2023) address the origin of new human diseases by focusing on the zoonotic parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. This parasite belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa which also includes the Malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. In their study, Corsi et al. (2023) analyse the genomic diversity of C. parvum obtained from human and ruminants collected across Europe, Egypt and China. They demonstrate recent recombination between human and animal infecting lineages and suggest that recombination across host-boundaries may be an important source of new genetic variation and rapid adaptation of such zoonotic pathogens. The recent Covid-19 pandemic exemplifies the importance of studying pathogens associated with animals in human environments. Inasmuch studying human-associated microbes can shed light on general evolutionary processes, the study of wild populations sets the reference to which human influence on these processes needs to be evaluated. Sinorhizobium meliloti (a.k.a. Ensifer meliloti) is a nitrogen-fixing bacteria closely related to symbionts of major legume crops such as soybean, alfalfa and peanut. Studying the population structure of bacterial chromosomes and mobile genetic elements of S. meliloti strains sampled across South Western Europe, Riley et al. (2023) found that within-site variation is more important than between-site variation and that the three genetic elements have distinct population structures, all three being discordant with the population structure of their natural host (Medicago truncatula). Authors also showed that recombination rates of mobile genetic elements are at least one order of magnitude greater than those of the chromosome. Strong population structure in the host and lack thereof in the symbionts suggest that different host populations interact with genetically similar symbionts, thus hampering local adaptation. Whether this is the case for crop legume hosts and their symbionts remains to be established. Richard et al. (2023) provide further evidence for the relevance of gene transfer among bacterial taxa. In their study they have focused on plasmid-encoding genes in the bacterial family Lysobacteraceae which includes important plant pathogenic bacteria and opportunistic human pathogens. Plasmids of Lysobacteraceae carry genes conferring functions related to pathogenicity and microbe-microbe interactions. These genes appear to be highly dynamic and readily exchanged across species boundaries. Interestingly, the authors find that different bacterial lifestyles constitute barriers to gene transfer although transfers can occur between very distantly related bacteria. This observation highlights the potential for rapid evolution of bacteria associated with human and agricultural environments and demonstrates that gene transfer is a mechanism to facilitate the fast establishment of bacteria into new niches. Mycorrhizal fungi is another group of plant mutualists. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi form symbiosis with plant roots and provide their host with nutrients, primarily phosphorus. Understanding the diversity and stability of mycorrhizal communities in agricultural soils is of great importance to predict how environmental change will impact beneficial symbioses in plant roots. Gao et al. (2023) have investigated the consequences of drought stress on mycorrhizal diversity using a large-scale field experiment of sorghum. Hereby they profiled the succession of microbial diversity associated with sorghum roots focusing specifically on mycorrhizal diversity. As predicted, mycorrhizal communities change in response to plant stress, however the change does not correspond to a replacement of competitive mycorrhizal species with non-competitive species (ruderal). Rather the change correlates with altered expression of plant genes which may play a role in regulating mycorrhiza symbiosis. To which extent mycorrhizal succession correlates with plant selection for optimal symbiotic partners is yet to be determined. However, the study underlines the necessity of understanding the impact of environmental changes and abiotic stresses on the diversity and function of plant-associated microbes. Over thousands of years, human activities have enormously changed ecosystems across the planet. Hereby we have also impacted the diversity and function of microbes associated with domesticated plants and animals. Advances in sequencing techniques have provided new tools to characterise microbial diversity from the level of individual populations to communities. Studies focused on pathogenic species associated with crops and husbandry have demonstrated the great impact of agriculture on microbial diversity and evolution. The uniform architecture of agricultural systems not only favours the rapid evolution and dispersal of pathogens but also promotes host jumps between crop species and between animal husbandry and humans. The application of antimicrobials and antifungals have, in the past decades, been an important solution to combat pathogens in medical as well as agricultural contexts. However, the usage of such compounds have multiple downsides; first of all they also target non-pathogenic microbes and thereby alter native microbiomes. Moreover, continuous usage of antimicrobials selects for microbial resistance and thereby the loss of compound efficacy. Resistance mutations may rapidly spread in an environment where resistance is advantageous, and the spread can occur within populations as well as across species boundaries by horizontal gene transfer. This special issue presents new research of evolutionary processes in microbes associated with our near environment including human-associated microbes and microbes associated with food production. Understanding the evolutionary ecology of these microbes is of critical importance for future applications intended to promote beneficial microbial symbionts and to control pathogens.

N2  - Tomato leafminer, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) is considered to be one of the major pests of tomato crop in Ethiopia. In tomato, economic impact is caused by larval which feeding leaves and fruits. Information on tomato leafminer economic injury levels (EILs) and economic thresholds (ETs) is relatively limited. Studies were conducted during 2015 to 2017 to determine EILs and ETs on open field is required for more effective management. The results from the current studies significant (P<0.05) differences were observed among the treatments during the study periods. T. absoluta was highly infested the untreated control as compared with protected treatment. The mean value of marketable yield loss to the cost of insecticide application at one larva/plant was 3.61% and from untreated control was obtained 77.91% during 2015/16. Similarly, during 2016/17 at one larva/plant and untreated control marketable yield loss were observed 5.57% and 81.61%, respectively. The highest yield loss was observed at unsprayed control (24,577.84 kg/ha) followed by five larvae/plant (10,587 kg/ha) during 2015/16 while during 2016/17 the highest yield loss also observed in untreated control (26,593.08 kg/ha) followed by five larvae/plant. From this study the economic injury level of T. absoluta was 3.82 larvae per plant. Therefore, based on economic injury level, the economic threshold level was determined as at 2.87 larvae per plant.

N2  - The steady decline in global malaria burden between 2000 and 2015 averted millions of deaths via diagnosis, treatment, and vector control, but disturbingly stagnated between 2016 and 2017, as shown in the WHO World Malaria Report 2018,1WHOWorld malaria report 2018.

By 2017, approximately 70% of the 219 million malaria cases were ascribed to ten African countries and India. The report also revealed an estimated additional 3·5 million cases in 2017 compared with 2016 in sub-Saharan Africa, with only 50% coverage of effective vector control in this region.1WHOWorld malaria report 2018.

N2  - Background: Chikungunya is a vector borne virus in alphaviridae family passed to humans by Aedes mosquito bite. Chikungunya virus has been transmitted by Aedesaegypti and Aedes Albopictus mosquitoes. Laboratory confirmation can be done via detection of CHIKV and anti- CHIKV antibody in blood samples. Because it is a risk group three pathogen, its containment is in biosafety level 3 facilities. This study aimed to determine factors associated with Chikungunya fever outbreak in Dolo ado district, South–Eastern Ethiopia in June 2016. Methods and materials: An unmatched case-control study design was used to investigate the outbreak in June 2016. A total of 33 cases and 66 controls were interviewed and serum sample were tested from 17 of the cases. Epidemiological data were collected through face to face interview using structured questionnaire. Laboratory tests were performed all 17 serum samples using Real Time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) technique. Statistical significance was determined using odds ratio with 95% confidence interval and p value <0.05. Results: From the total of 99 respondents, 37(37.4%) were males and 62(62.6%) were females. Fourteen cases among 17 were laboratory positive. Failure to use long lasting impregnated bed net [AOR = 14.6,(1.7–127.8), (p = 0.015)], presence of Aedes mosquito larvae in water holding container in and around the households [AOR = 25.6(1.5–442.5), (p = 0.025]) and travel history to Mandera (the neighboring Kenyan town) two weeks back from the date of onset of illness[AOR = 37.3(4.3 - 321.3),(p = 0.001)] were found associated with contracting the disease. Conclusion: This investigation notes that Chikungunya has emerged in Ethiopia as additional cause of acute febrile illness. Vector control intervention, particularly, long lasting insecticide nets, indoor residual spray and larvicidal should be applied to halt the transmission. Continuous education should be offered for border crossing people to dress long sleeved clothes. Ministry of health of Ethiopia should recognize the disease as public health threat and prepare guideline, intervention strategy and reporting mechanism.

N2  - Ownership of insecticidal mosquito nets has dramatically increased in Ethiopia since 2006, but the proportion of persons with access to such nets who use them has declined. It is important to understand individual level net use factors in the context of the home to modify programmes so as to maximize net use. Generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM) were used to investigate net use using individual level data from people living in net-owning households from two surveys in Ethiopia: baseline 2006 included 12,678 individuals from 2,468 households and a sub-sample of the Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) in 2007 included 14,663 individuals from 3,353 households. Individual factors (age, sex, pregnancy); net factors (condition, age, net density); household factors (number of rooms [2006] or sleeping spaces [2007], IRS, women's knowledge and school attendance [2007 only], wealth, altitude); and cluster level factors (rural or urban) were investigated in univariate and multi-variable models for each survey. In 2006, increased net use was associated with: age 25-49 years (adjusted (a) OR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-1.7) compared to children U5; female gender (aOR = 1.4; 95% CI 1.2-1.5); fewer nets with holes (Ptrend = 0.002); and increasing net density (Ptrend < 0.001). Reduced net use was associated with: age 5-24 years (aOR = 0.2; 95% CI 0.2-0.3). In 2007, increased net use was associated with: female gender (aOR = 1.3; 95% CI 1.1-1.6); fewer nets with holes (aOR [all nets in HH good] = 1.6; 95% CI 1.2-2.1); increasing net density (Ptrend < 0.001); increased women's malaria knowledge (Ptrend < 0.001); and urban clusters (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.5-4.1). Reduced net use was associated with: age 5-24 years (aOR = 0.3; 95% CI 0.2-0.4); number of sleeping spaces (aOR [per additional space] = 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.7); more old nets (aOR [all nets in HH older than 12 months] = 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-0.7); and increasing household altitude (Ptrend < 0.001). In both surveys, net use was more likely by women, if nets had fewer holes and were at higher net per person density within households. School-age children and young adults were much less likely to use a net. Increasing availability of nets within households (i.e. increasing net density), and improving net condition while focusing on education and promotion of net use, especially in school-age children and young adults in rural areas, are crucial areas for intervention to ensure maximum net use and consequent reduction of malaria transmission.

N2  - In the Ethiopia crop agriculture, pillar in balancing the food diet of the majority people, as a whole and the cereals specifically is facing serious and vast challenges which in turn affect the supply of food grains. Various research institutes in Ethiopia have revealed several factors which affect crop production over the past three decades, but their findings are not synthesized into a whole and difficult to access as such. This study attempts to review various existing research findings and present them holistically. The most common factors are lack of more recently introduced improved seeds, initial capital for investment, loss of cropland, labor, pesticides, invasive alien species, farm storage techniques, methods of small scale irrigation, and religious and cultural challenges. Thorough understanding these constraints, researchers and policy makers can make useful recommendations to crop growers&amp;rsquo; on farm improvement system and not on how to devastate well designed sustainable crop production systems. Succinct and collated scientific information would help to shade light on the best standards to overcome most factors affecting crop production and enhance the productivity and quality of crops. Moreover, this paper offers more implications and recommendations for various stakeholders in Ethiopian and similar contexts.

N2  - Utilization of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is regarded as key malaria prevention and control strategy. However, studies have reported a large gap in terms of both ownership and utilization particularly in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). With continual efforts to improve the use of LLIN and to progress malaria elimination, examining the factors influencing the ownership and usage of LLIN is of high importance. Therefore, the current study was conducted to examine the level of ownership and use of LLIN along with identification of associated factors at household level.A cross-sectional study was conducted in Mirab Abaya District, Southern Ethiopia in June and July 2014. A total of 540 households, with an estimated 2690 members, were selected in four kebeles of the district known to have high incidence of malaria. Trained data collectors interviewed household heads to collect information on the knowledge, ownership and utilization of LLINs, which was complemented by direct observation on the conditions and use of the nets through house-to-house visit. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine factors associated to LLIN use.Of 540 households intended to be included in the survey, 507 responded to the study (94.24% response rate), covering the homes of 2759 people. More than 58% of the households had family size >5 (the regional average), and 60.2% of them had at least one child below the age of 5 years. The ownership of at least one LLIN among households surveyed was 89.9%, and using at least one LLIN during the night prior to the survey among net owners was 85.1% (n = 456). Only 36.7% (186) mentioned at least as the mean of correct scores of all participants for 14 possible malaria symptoms and 32.7% (166) knew at least as the mean of correct scores of all participants for possible preventive methods. Over 30% of nets owned by the households were out of use. After controlling for confounding factors, having two or more sleeping places (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.58, 95% CI 1.17, 5.73), knowledge that LLIN prevents malaria (aOR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.17, 5.37), the presence of hanging bed nets (aOR = 19.24, 95% CI 9.24, 40.07) and walls of the house plastered or painted >12 months ago (aOR = 0.09, 95% CI 0.01, 0.71) were important predictors of LLIN utilization.This study found a higher proportion of LLIN ownership and utilization by households than had previously been found in similar studies in Ethiopia, and in many studies in SSA. However, poor knowledge of the transmission mechanisms and the symptoms of malaria, and vector control measures to prevent malaria were evident. Moderate proportions of nets were found to be out of use or in poor repair. Efforts should be in place to maintain the current rate of utilization of LLIN in the district and improve on the identified gaps in order to support the elimination of malaria.

N2  - A survey was conducted in 2016 in the major onion producing areas of the Ethiopian Central Rift Valley. A structured questionnaire was used to assess farmers&rsquo; management practices with a focus on the use of insecticides. Plant samples were collected to assess species composition of thrips and their abundance. Results showed that insecticides were the only control methods for onion growers to control thrips infesting onion. The insecticides diazinon, dimethoate, profenofos, lambda-cyhalothrin and spinetoram were commonly used. Level of insecticide use was higher in Meki than Melkassa and Werer. The volume of insecticide for thrips control and thrips population was noted to be on the increase over the years. Frankliniella occidentalis and Thrips tabaci were present in all surveyed areas with T. tabaci accounting for a higher proportion. The relative species composition varied significantly with location. The highest proportion of T. tabaci was recorded at Werer, where insecticide use was relatively minimal. On the other hand, F. occidentalis was highest at Meki where insecticide use was also higher. The study suggests that thrips infesting onion have developed resistance to the commonly used insecticides. Further studies are required to confirm and develop a thrips resistance management program in the area. Key words: Frankliniella occidentalis, Thrips tabaci, onion, species composition. &nbsp

N2  - In a two-year study, aqueous seed extracts of the neem tree Azadirachta indica A. Juss (Meliaceae) and Bacillus thurigiensis (Bt) were evaluated in the field for the management of pests of okra, Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench. The aqueous neem seed extracts were applied at the rate of 30, 50, 75 and 100 g/l and B.thurigiensis was applied at the rate 1.0 g/l of water. Actellic 25 EC, a synthetic insecticide, was applied at the rate of 2 ml/l as standard check. Arthropod fauna on okra were sampled using traps, sweep nets, aspirators and handpicking. The nature of damage caused to the stems, leaves, flowers and fruit was assessed by visual observation. The major insect pests of okra collected were Podagrica uniformis Jac, Aphis gossypii Glov, Sylepta derogata (F.), Spodoptera litoralis Boisd, Prodenia litura (F.), Dysdercus superstitiosus (F.), Epilachna similis (F.), Bemisia tabaci (Genn.) and Zonocerus variegatus (F.). These pests were observed attacking mainly the leaves of okra. Some of the minor pests identified were Lagria villosa (F.), L. cuprina Thoms, Mylabris temporalis Wellni, M. trifasciata (Thumb.), Lapidognatha sp and Empoasca devastans (D.). Actellic, neem seed extract and Bt significantly reduced the population and damage caused by the major insect pests of okra recorded at Legon, Ghana compared to the untreated. Actellic and aqueous neem seed extracts were equally effective against the pests of okra and caused a significant reduction in insect damage to the leaves, flowers and fruit of the crop. There were no significant differences among the different dosages of neem seed extract on all the parameters assessed, with the exception of the final fruit yield. Actellic, neem extracts or Bt produced higher yield of marketable fruit of okra than untreated plants. Neem seed extract applied at the rate of 30 g/l of water to okra plants produced lower fruit yield than those treated with 50 g or more. Aqueous neem seed extracts and Bt can be used effectively by farmers as a component of integrated management of pests of okra in Ghana.

N2  - The field pea (<i>Pisum sativum</i>), is a significant legume crop that enhances soil fertility while providing curtail human nourishment. However, due to biotic factors like diseases, its productivity is quite low (1.67 t/ha). Hence, the objective of this study is to provide insight into the economic significance, distribution, and current management strategies for these most significant diseases as well as to establish future approaches. The current significant diseases affecting field pea production include fungal diseases such Ascochyta blight (<i>Ascochyta pisi</i>), powdery (<i>Erysiphe pisi</i>), and downy mildews, Fusarium wilt, and rust. The most severe of these are Aschochyta blight and powdery mildew, which on field pea in larger areas result in significance yield losses (30-75% and 50-86%, respectively), and under favorable environmental conditions, 100% losses can be expected. The majority of small-scale farmers in impoverished nations like Ethiopia, where these pests cause serious losses, cannot afford the chemical pesticides that are the mainstay of existing pest control tactics. Therefore, research on host pant resistance for these pests' management techniques and farmers to better understand frequent symptoms, whether on the field or in storage conditions, must be major areas of focus for reducing impact in the future.

N2  - Finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn) is a highly nutritious crop, predominantly grown in the semi-arid tropics of the world. Finger millet has a niche market opportunity due to its human health benefits and being rich in calcium, iron and dietary fiber and gluten-free. Ethiopia is the center of the genetic diversity of the crop. However, the productivity of finger millet in the country is low (&lt;2.4 tons ha−1) compared with its potential yield (6 tons ha−1). The yield gap in Ethiopia is due to a range of biotic and abiotic stresses and socio-economic constraints that are yet to be systemically documented and prioritized to guide future production and improved variety development and release. The objective of this study was to document finger millet production opportunities, constraints and farmer-preferred traits in Ethiopia as a guide to variety design in improvement programs. A participatory rural appraisal (PRA) study was undertaken in six selected districts of the Southern Nation Nationalities People Region (SNNPR) and Oromia Region in Ethiopia. Data were collected from 240 and 180 participant farmers through a semi-structured questionnaire and focus group discussion, respectively. Finger millet was the most important crop in the study areas grown mainly for a combination of uses, including for food, feed and cash (reported by 38.8% of respondent farmers), food and feed (14.5%), food and cash (13.7%), food (11.5%) and food, cash, feed and construction material (9.7%). Hand weeding was used by 59.2% of the respondent farmers, followed by hand weeding and chemical herbicides (40.8%). Finger millet was mainly planted as a sole crop (reported by 97.0% respondents), mixed (1.7%) and sole and mixed (1.3%). About 75.6% of respondent farmers only practiced finger millet rotation with other crops. Respondent farmers indicated their source of fresh seed was from the Bureau of Agriculture (49.1%), farmer-to-farmer seed exchange (22.1%), own saved seed (7.5%), local producers (7.5%), research institutions (5.8%), unknown sources (4.1%), local market (3.5%) and cooperatives (0.42%). The total cost of finger millet production per hectare was calculated at 1249 USD with a total income of 2139 USD/ha, making a benefit to cost ratio of 1.71:1.00 and indicating the relatively low yield gains using the currently grown varieties. The main constraints to finger millet production in the study areas were drought stress (reported by 41.3% respondents), lack of improved varieties (12.9%), lack of financial resources (11.3%), small land holdings (10.8%), limited access to seed (10.0%), a shortage of fertilizers (5.4%), poor soil fertility (4.6%), shortage of draught power (1.3%), labour shortages (1.3%) and high labour costs (1.3%). The most important farmer-preferred traits in a finger millet variety were high grain yield, compact head shape, ‘enjera’-making quality, high marketability and early maturity, resolved through principal component analysis. The above-mentioned production constraints and farmer-preferred traits are strategic drivers to enhance finger millet productivity and need to be incorporated into Ethiopia’s finger millet breeding and technology development.

N2  - In Ethiopia, Pastoralists represent approximately 10% percent of the country population, and approximately 40% of the land area of Ethiopia is considered to be under pastoral production system. Consequently, Pastoralists contribute a significant amount to the national economy. However, the pastoral production system and in particular the food security and livelihood situation is highly threatened due to various factors. This review is, therefore, shows the definition and concepts of food security and livelihood diversification. Besides, it elaborate factors affecting food security and effect of livelihood diversification on food security in pastoral area of Ethiopia. Methodologically, this manuscript is based on intensive literature review of published materials such as books, articles and extra scholar materials. It was displayed that household head sex, family size, age of household head, educational level of household head, crop production and agricultural technology (use of chemical fertilizer and pesticides, improved seeds), livestock ownership and number, dependency ratio, distance from market center, access to credit and developmental agents visit had found to be significant in determining household food security. Livelihood diversification basically influenced by push and pull factors. In general, higher the level of the household livelihood diversification, results with, the more food secure of the households. In the future, concerned agents should focus on boosting educational level, family planning and awareness creation to reduce dependency ratio, credit serves and visit by development agents for livelihood diversification and thereby food security.

N2  - Oleo-gum resins such as frankincense and myrrh are some of the economically and culturally valuable products obtained from trees and shrubs of the genera Boswellia and Commiphora, respectively. They are important natural plant products used in several industries that include pharmacology, food, flavour, liqueur and beverage, cosmetics, perfumery and others. Moreover, frankincense and myrrh have several local applications in medicinal, hygienic, and insecticide areas that could be developed through research. They are widely used in traditional medicines of several countries for treatments of a wide variety of ailments from embalming to cancer, leprosy, bronchitis, diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, mouth ulcers, inflammatory complaints, viral hepatitis, female disorders, infections/wounds, coughs, tumour, and others. Although Ethiopia is one of the few countries that are endowed with large frankincense and myrrh resources, little proper exploitation of these resources has been made so far. In this paper a review is presented on pharmacological and industrial applications of these valuable resources. The information is expected to prompt the enormous economic opportunity that these resources could provide both at national and local levels. Concurrently, this opportunity, if properly exploited, will contribute significantly towards the conservation and management of the vegetation resources that yield frankincense and myrrh as well as their ecosystems.

N2  - Tomato is an important vegetable crop grown around the world. Tomato is the most widely cultivated and lucrative vegetable in Ethiopia in particular and in the world in general. It is well known that disease late blight affects tomato crop production and late blight is one of the most devastating diseases of tomatoes worldwide and causes significant loss in production. The objective of this study is to update fruit yield loss assessment data for tomato late blight disease. In this study, 3 treatments were used in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. The combined analysis of variance (ANOVA) results for AUDPC and total fruit yield shows significant differences (P&lt;0.05) among treatments. As compared to the unsprayed (control) plot both fungicides significantly controlled the disease at both early and late stage of the crop. The lowest AUDPC (560) was recorded on fungicide Fahem-Gold 72% WP sprayed treatment followed by Mancozeb (752.5). The control treatment (water sprayed) had the highest AUDPC (1592.5). The highest mean fruit yield (16.5 t ha-1) was obtained from fungicide Fahem-Gold 72% WP followed by the standard fungicide (Mancozeb) which gave (8.98 t ha -1) whereas the control treatment gave 4.67 t ha -1. The highest levels of yield loss 71.7% occurred in the unsprayed plots of variety Gulelema as compared to the best protected plot sprayed with Fahem fungicide. Generally, disease and yield parameters indicate that among the two fungicides spray; Fahem was the most effective followed by Mancozeb sprayed plot as compared to unsprayed plots.

N2  - Various biotic, abiotic and socio-economic factors negatively affect the productivity of the crop. Among these, a new disease known as Faba bean galls (Olpidium viciae) has become a serious threat to faba bean production and productivity in highland areas of central and northern Ethiopia. Thus, field experiment was conducted in Lay Gorebela and Mush to assess the efficacies of fungicides for the management of faba bean gall under natural infection. Six fungicides were evaluated alongside control in randomized complete block design in three replications. Fungicides showed different levels of efficiency at both locations in both seasons. In 2014/15, the highest percent severity index and area under disease progress curve were calculated from control plots at both locations. At Lay Gorebela, higher grain yields were recorded from Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP and Triadimefon 250 g/L sprayed plots whereas plots sprayed with Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP gave higher yield at Mush. Similar trends in percent severity index and grain yield were observed with control treatment in 2015/16. Percent severity index and area under disease progress curve were negatively correlated with grain yield and positively correlated with each other at both locations and seasons. Partial budget analysis indicated as Triadimefon 250 g/L and Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP were cost-effective. The chemical treatment could be used as a short-term control strategy, and a component in integrated management of faba bean galls.

N2  - Abstract BACKGROUND Vector control is the main intervention in malaria control and elimination strategies. However, the development of insecticide resistance is one of the major challenges for controlling malaria vectors. Anopheles arabiensis populations in Ethiopia showed resistance against both DDT and the pyrethroid deltamethrin. Although a L1014F target-site resistance mutation was present in the voltage gated sodium channel of investigated populations, the levels of resistance and biochemical studies indicated the presence of additional resistance mechanisms. In this study, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling by RNAseq to assess differentially expressed genes between three deltamethrin and DDT resistant An. arabiensis field populations (Tolay, Asendabo, Chewaka) and two susceptible strains (Sekoru and Mozambique). RESULTS Both RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR showed that a glutathione-S-transferase, gstd3 , and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, cyp6p4 , were significantly overexpressed in the group of resistant populations compared to the susceptible strains, suggesting that the enzymes they encode play a key role in metabolic resistance against deltamethrin or DDT. Furthermore, a gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that expression changes of cuticle related genes were strongly associated with insecticide resistance, although this did not translate in increased thickness of the procuticle. CONCLUSION Our transcriptome sequencing of deltamethrin/DDT resistant An. arabiensis populations from Ethiopia suggests non-target site resistance mechanisms and pave the way for further investigation of the role of cuticle composition in resistance.

N2  - The use of chemical pesticide in Ethiopian agriculture has a steady historically growth and strongly associated with the need to boost crop production and expansion in a high-input floriculture industry. An increased crop production and productivity is mainly dependent on effective and efficient pest management strategies. Recently, achieving these strategic goals of the sector seems to be impossible without intensive use of synthetic pesticides. Unfortunately, the chemical-based option of pest management was not able to deliver only the positively intended purpose of managing pests. It has raised a potential menace not only to public health and the environment but also to the fast-growing economy of the country. The main objective of this review was to highlight the negative health and environmental impacts of agricultural pesticides in Ethiopia. Literature based comprehensive review was made with the intention to influence stake holders in the sector to recognize the negative impact of agricultural pesticides to help them to devise a mitigating strategy and finally the authors tried to indicate solutions on this regard. Health conditions such as dizziness, nausea, skin and eye irritations, headache, vomiting and general discomfort after spraying are some of the self-reported direct health problems. Other chronic non-reported health problems/deaths were also associated with misuse (handling and disposal) of pesticides. Mismanagement of pesticides kills important organisms and are damaging to the biodiversity. Moreover, an intensive, non-responsible use of pesticides has increased the cost of pest management, accelerated the development of new pests and/or resistant strains (races) of pests and negatively affected the international trade of farm produces. Lack of awareness (poor pesticide management, disposal; and limited use of complete PPEs), obsolete pesticide stocks, prolonged storage, poor storage facilities, the lack of trained staff and national legislation for pesticide registration and monitoring system in the country are the main reasons associated with pesticide risks. Harmonized agriculture development policy, capacity building, organic farming, IPM compatible pesticides and gender-sensitive education will change the risk of agricultural pesticides.

N2  - Abstract Background Agriculture is a critical source of food and income, making it a key component of initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and ensuring food security across the globe. It is the backbone of Ethiopia's economy, contributing significantly to the country's financial development. The sector earns 88.8 percent of trade profit and contributes 36.7 percent of GDP. The purpose of this paper was to identify the homogeneous and heterogeneous effects of agricultural inputs on crop productivity of the three-grain crop types in Ethiopia. Method The central statistical agency (CSA) provided the data for this study, which covered the entire country from 1990 to 2012 Ethiopian Calendar (E.C). Crop productivity, which is assessed in kilograms per hectare for cereal, pulse, and oil crops, was utilized as the response variable. For three-grain crop types from 1990 to 2012 E.C, the study used the pooled mean group estimate method, which allows for long-run homogeneity effects across cross-sections as well as short-run heterogeneity. Results In the long run, the study found that a one percent increase in fertilizer consumption resulted in a 2.686 percent increase in grain crop productivity in Ethiopia, while a one percent increase in improved seed per hectare and land size, resulted in a 48.31 percent and 10.58 percent increase in grain crop productivity per crop category respectively. Short-run productivity for grain crops increased by 30.29 percent as the amount of improved seed value at one period lag value of commercial farm holders is increased by one percent. In the same way, when the arable land at the first difference is increased by one percent then the productivity of grain crops increased by 40.61 percent. Conclusion The findings of this research showed that in the long run, fertilizer consumption, amount of improved seed use, and arable land area size had homogeneous significant contributions, while in the short run, agricultural inputs like the use of pesticides and improved seed use at first lagged value had heterogeneous significant contributions to grain crop productivity improvement across all cross-sectional units.

N2  - Agriculture is a critical source of food and income, making it a key component of poverty reduction and ensuring food security across the globe. The sector generates 88.8 percent of the trade profit and contributes 36.7 percent of GDP. The purpose of this paper is to identify the homogeneous and heterogeneous effects of agricultural inputs on crop productivity of three-grain crop types in Ethiopia using an appropriate PMG estimator, as well as to evaluate the effect of agricultural input heterogeneity and homogeneity across individual cross-sectional units (crops). The central statistical agency (CSA) provided the data for this study, which covered the entire country from 1990 to 2012 Ethiopian Calendar (E.C). In the long run, the study found that a one percent increase in fertilizer use resulted in a 2.686 percent increase in productivity of grain crops in Ethiopia, while a corresponding increase in improved seed per hectare and land size resulted in a 48.31 percent and 10.58 percent increase in productivity of grain crops per crop type, respectively. As the value of improved seed increased by one percent with a period lag among commercial farmers, the short-term production of cereal crops increased by 30.29 percent. Grain crop productivity improved by 40.6 percent when area increased by one percent at the first difference. The results of this study show that fertilizer use, improved seed use, and cropland size made homogeneous significant contributions to improved grain crop productivity in the long run across all cross-sectional units. However, in the short run, agricultural inputs such as pesticide use and improved seed use made heterogeneous significant contributions to the first lagged value

N2  - Ethiopia has the most bee colonies and surplus honey sources of flora; it is Africa's top honey producer.Ethiopia produces approximately 24000 tons of crude honey per year, accounting for 24% of Africa's and 2% of the world's production.The objectives of this study were to identify actors in the value chain, assess their linkages and roles, estimate marketing margins for each actor, and identify factors influencing farmers' market channel choice for selling honey.Both primary and secondary data were utilized.The primary data were collected from 160 randomly selected producers, while the secondary data were gathered from various published and unpublished sources.Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean, minimum, maximum; percentage, t-test; ranking index; and gross market margin analysis.Honey producers, wholesalers, retailers, collectors, processors, and consumers were identified as the major honey value chain actors in the studied districts.Beekeepers use six different marketing channels to sell their honey until it reaches the end consumer.Market margin analysis was performed to estimate the marketing and profit margin differences between each actor and channel.A multinomial logit model was used to identify factors influencing honey producers' channel choice for marketing.MNL findings revealed that age, family size, education level, access to credit, distance to the nearest market, experience in beekeeping production, and membership in cooperative of the household heads were the most significant factors influencing beekeepers' decision to sell their honey directly to various marketing outlets.The distractive statistics results showed that honey production in study areas was limited due to a lack of bee flora, pesticide application, and herbicide use.Despite the fact that there are other beekeeping opportunities such as land availability, ease of management, government support, and the availability of forest and water in the study districts.Beekeepers should be kept up to date on current market trends so that they can choose the best market channel to maximize profits and improve their livelihoods.This can be accomplished through the use of agricultural and rural development offices, farmer training centers, and other voluntary NGOs; however, mass media and mobile messaging are more effective for updating marketing formation.

N2  - Hot pepper (Capsicum annum L.) is one of the important cash crops to Ethiopian smallholder farmers and an important agricultural commodity which contribute to export earnings. In Ethiopia, this high value crop is constrained by powdery mildew, Phytophthora leaf blight, Fusarium wilt, bacterial leaf spot, bacterial wilt, bacterial soft rot and pepper motile virus. Among this diseases, wilt disease caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. capsici (FOC) is one of the major pathogen that constrained production and productivity of hot pepper in Ethiopia mainly the Central Rift valley. In Ethiopia, hot pepper fusarium wilt is reported in all production regions in different magnitude. The highest wilt incidence due to fusarium is 90% in some Farmers association of Alaba districts in South Nation Nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia. The economic yield losses due to Fusarium wilt has been estimated at 68 to 71%. Infection and disease development in Fusarium wilt is favored by warm soil temperature, low soil moisture, susceptible host, virulent pathogen and 5.0 to 6.0 pH levels; are some of epidemic factors. Fusarium is reproduced by sexually by teleomorphs and asexually by microconidia, macroconidia and chlamydospore. From the Central rift valley of Ethiopia, 49 FOC isolates were identified based on micro and macroscopic characteristics and the isolate having pink colony color, 3-5 septa forming conidia on potato dextrose agar, perform the most pathogenic ability to Mareko Fana Variety. This pathogen has an over wintering stage called chlamydospore which can exist in the soil for more than ten years without the host. Hot pepper fusarium wilt can be managed by host resistance, biological agent, botanicals and fungicide. In Ethiopia, pepper screening for resistant source, in vitro evaluation of bioagents and fungicides were done. In this review attempt has been made to summarize relevant scientific studies on this economically important crop, hot pepper fusarium wilt and associated factors in Ethiopia as well as its different disease management options, challenges and future prospects.

N2  - The research was carried out in neighboring weredas in Ethiopia (Raya Alamata in the Tigray region and Raya Kobo in Amhara) and assessed reasons for differences in the food security status of households in the two areas. The objective was to examine the relationship between disparities in social vulnerability and food security among households in the two woredas. Despite their close proximity, similar work cultures, natural resource availability, and land size, there is a significant difference in food security status and social vulnerability between Raya Alamata and Raya Kobo communities, with Raya Alamata reporting 84% food insecurity and Raya Kobo reporting 24%. Using propensity score matching (PSM), the study compared the degree of social vulnerability and food security of households, and the key variables linked to differences in food security between the communities of the two weredas were differences in irrigation systems, usage of agricultural inputs, extension packages, and other support systems. In contrast to Raya Kobo, where 68% of sample HHs use a groundwater irrigation system for agriculture, Raya Alamata woreda employs just 8.2% of such systems. Similar to this, in Raya Kobo, 51%, 49%, 31%, 27%, and 18% of the sampled HHs have appropriate access to better seeds, extension services, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, soil and water conservation measures, and manure. Only 0.9% of the surveyed HHs in Raya Alamata, however, receive improved seeds; 1.8% receive extension services; 1.8% receive chemical fertilizers; 0.9% receive compost or manure; 1.8% receive water and soil conservation programs. In addition to households’ access to irrigation, extension services, and agricultural inputs being much greater in Raya Kobo compared to Raya Alamata, the notable differences in the food security status of households in Raya Alamata and in Raya Kobo are due to the varying levels of social vulnerability in terms of access to basic social services and infrastructures, such as education, rural road facilities, potable water, and health. Differences in social vulnerability and food security between the Raya Alamata and Raya Kobo districts could not be explained by differences in farmland size and fertility. The key factors determining the food security of households are the availability of irrigation systems, the provision of agricultural inputs, and the availability of extension services. To ensure food security and significantly reduce poverty in the area, the study advises the provision of irrigation infrastructure, extension services, and agricultural inputs with strong market linkages.

N2  - Up in the highlands of the Ethiopian plateau grows a tree with bright red fruit that came to profoundly shape morning rituals for people all over the world. Those little fruits — also known as cherries — contain seeds that after harvesting, processing and roasting, turn into coffee beans.In their native land, coffee trees typically grow in the understory of tropical forests. And not surprisingly, people first cultivated the plants in the shade, re-creating their natural environment. That practice persisted even after coffee production spread around the globe, and eventually a mosaic of several production types emerged, with shade featured in all but one.CREDIT: JAMES PROVOST (CC BY-ND)Ecologist Ivette PerfectoUniversity of MichiganAt one end of the spectrum, “rustic” or “mountain” production planted coffee on the forest floor under existing tree cover — a system adopted by some local communities and Indigenous groups, with minimal use of pesticides.Traditional, slightly more managed polycultures created “coffee gardens” in the forest by keeping or adding useful plants such as food crops or ones with medicinal value. Commercial polycultures also sprang up, which removed the forest but mimicked it, planting coffee beneath useful canopy trees such as rubber and cedar.As coffee production intensified, shaded monocultures came on the scene, with one species of tree as the canopy. Finally, by the mid-1980s and 1990s, unshaded monocultures emerged, which operate like many modern agricultural enterprises: intensively managed with plenty of synthetic fertilizers and herbicides.But in recent decades, with growing concern about steep declines in biodiversity, there has been renewed interest in the value of coffee grown in the shade. The latitudes where coffee is grown host some of the highest levels of biodiversity on Earth. And in shade production systems, especially those that minimize the use of chemical pesticides, coffee has lots of company: The plants are visited by a multitude of creatures from ants and beetles to birds and bats.Coffee farming practices typically fall on a gradient that was described in the late 1990s based on practices in Mexico. At one extreme is the “rustic” system wherein coffee is planted in forest understory (top); at the other extreme is an unshaded monoculture of “sun” coffee (bottom). Generally, there is more biodiversity and less agrochemical use toward the rustic end of the spectrum, and the farms are smaller. But there’s a quite a bit of variation in production practices — some large plantations, for example, minimize chemical inputs and maintain shade trees.CREDIT: I. PERFECTO ET AL / CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY 2019. GRAPHIC BY D. BRENNER, PHOTOS BY I. PERFECTO.Given this biological richness, it’s no surprise that there’s growing interest in studying coffee as an agroecosystem — a dynamic bridge between natural and agricultural systems. Such farming methods have the potential not only to help sustain our caffeine fix, but also to provide a bounty of biological richness. The work of Ivette Perfecto has been central to this shift. An ecologist at the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan, Perfecto has spent decades studying the diverse assemblage of species that make coffee farms their home, especially some of the smallest farmworkers — the insects.Historically, biodiversity conservation has focused on the establishment of protected areas like parks and reserves. But agricultural lands, which cover more than twice as much land as such protected areas, can also offer opportunities for conservation. Shaded coffee farms, for example, can serve as refuges that provide quality habitat for wildlife, Perfecto told Knowable Magazine.This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.What sparked your interest in studying coffee landscapes?I became interested in the conservation of biodiversity while a graduate student at the University of Michigan’s School of Natural Resources and Environment [now the School for Environment and Sustainability]. Their strong biodiversity conservation program was focused on establishing protected areas, but I became fascinated by how land outside of protected areas can support biodiversity too.I’m from Puerto Rico, so I work a lot in Latin America. And I was used to seeing agricultural landscapes rich in wildlife diversity. For my dissertation, I focused on the role of ants in annual cropping systems like milpa corn and beans in Nicaragua. YOU MAY ALSO LIKE Food & Environment A blizzard of “sustainability” labels Food & Environment How truffles took root around the world Food & Environment To help birds and insects, cultivate native gardens In the late ’80s to early ’90s, while teaching a course for the Organization for Tropical Studies about managed ecosystems — mostly agricultural systems — I began looking at the diversity of ants and their role in the coffee agroecosystem, comparing a coffee monoculture with a shaded system. That’s when my interest in coffee and biodiversity started.What was the coffee landscape after it arrived in the Americas?Coffee cultivation was heavily influenced by colonial powers. When it was introduced in the 1700s, most of the coffee produced was in the plantation or hacienda style. In some parts of the Americas, large coffee estates were established, and enslaved people from Africa were used for labor. After slavery was abolished, local farmers and former slaves were employed to maintain and harvest the coffee.Not all coffee farms were monocultures though, and in some regions, coffee was grown under shade trees. Interestingly, in Brazil, it was produced in the sun. As for the reason behind this difference, I’m not sure.In Chiapas, Mexico, where I work, large coffee plantations were established by Europeans who hired local peasants to harvest the coffee. These workers eventually started producing coffee commercially, introducing it to their traditional farming systems. Since many of these farmers were Indigenous people with diverse farming systems, coffee production in small-scale farms tended to be more diverse than in large-scale plantations.Eventually, there was a shift from growing coffee in the shade of trees toward growing it as a monoculture in the sun. What prompted that shift?There were several factors, but in Central America in particular there was a big program launched in the 1980s by USAID to intensify coffee farms. The ’80s is known as the lost decade of Latin America because it was a time when a lot of the countries had very high debt. As coffee is a very important economic crop for many Central American countries, the idea was to increase and intensify coffee production. So USAID provided a grant to these countries to stimulate conversion to monocultures and substitute old traditional varieties with new, higher-yielding varieties.Coffee is an understory plant, and does well under shade trees, but if you expose traditional coffee plants to open sun, they don’t do very well. New varieties were developed that could do well in open areas. But it’s a whole technological package. When you eliminate shade, you eliminate, in many cases, nitrogen-fixing trees — like Erythrina in Costa Rica, or Inga in Mexico. By eliminating these trees, you eliminate sources of soil nitrogen and organic matter, so you then need to apply fertilizers. Weeds also move in. So you apply herbicides. And because it’s a monoculture, that leads to a greater probability of pests, so you apply more pesticides.So during this era, you had increased use of new coffee varieties, but also rising use of agrochemicals.A coffee plantation in Chiapas, Mexico.CREDIT: PHOTO BY IVETTE PERFECTO / FLICKRWhat were some of the biodiversity impacts of this changing coffee landscape?Some of the earliest impacts were detected in birds. It had become almost common knowledge among birders that to see birds in Latin or Central America, a good place to go was to coffee farms. It’s easier to see the birds there than it is in the forest. But in the late 1980s to early 1990s, the composition of those coffee farms had begun to change as farmers eliminated shade trees.In the mid-1990s, I was contacted by Russell Greenberg, then director of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, who has sadly since passed away. He had been studying migratory birds in Central America for many, many years. He and others had grown concerned that at the same time that they were witnessing this transformation of increasing intensification of coffee throughout Central America, there were reports of declines in birds in North America — birds that migrate to Central and South America during the wintertime.Russ contacted me to write a review paper to document links between bird diversity and coffee production, which we published together in BioScience in 1996. In that review of research conducted in the Caribbean Islands, Mexico, Central and South America, we summarized evidence that shade coffee plantations were providing refuge, especially in the dry season, and particularly for forest-dependent migratory birds.Around the same time, the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center organized a conference and invited not only ornithologists but a lot of people in the coffee sector. Out of that conference emerged the Smithsonian Bird Friendly coffee certification program. The main philosophy behind the certification was to stimulate the organic farmers that already had very diverse farms not to cut their trees. The rigorous certification criteria include stipulations about the height of canopy, percent foliage cover, diversity of trees, shrubs and surrounding ground plants, buffer zones beside waterways, and allowing leaf litter to feed and protect the soil. The Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center bird-friendly coffee certification scheme still exists today.As more ecological studies were done in these shifting coffee landscapes, were any broad patterns revealed?Definitely. The major pattern that emerged was that with increasing intensification comes a decline in species richness or biodiversity. This is a pattern found in many different organisms sampled, and studies have shown that shade coffee can contribute to supporting plant, insect, spider, lizard, bird, bat and mammal diversity. On one of the coffee farms where I work in Mexico, a couple of years ago we saw a baby margay — a species of wild cat fairly rare in this area — so they also use that habitat.Coffee farms, especially those that maintain shade trees and use fewer agrochemicals, can support a diversity of creatures. These include lizards such as the silky anole (top left), which is predator of the formidable pest, the coffee berry borer; mammals, such as the little yellow-shouldered bat (top right); and birds, including those that overwinter in the south such as scarlet tanagers (bottom right), and locals such as the Santa Marta antbird (bottom left). But coffee farms can’t do it alone: Research suggests that mosaics of farms and intact forest may be key to conservation efforts.CREDIT, CLOCKWISE FROM TOP LEFT: DAVID MARROQUIN PEREZ, HENRIQUE RABELLO, FLOZADA, GUYINCOGNITO / CC BY-NCBiodiversity also contributes ecosystem services to coffee production. For example, in one study conducted in Mexico we built structures to keep birds and bats out — to see what would happen in terms of the numbers of herbivorous insects found on coffee plants. My postdoc at the time, Kimberly Williams-Guillén, demonstrated that both bats and birds contribute to reducing these insect pests. The most profound impacts were seen during the wet season, when birds reduced arthropods by 58 percent and bats reduced them by 84 percent.Healthy ecosystems surrounding coffee might help with reducing the disease impacts too, like rust fungus, which affects the leaves of coffee plants, causing their loss and reducing their ability to photosynthesize and produce energy for flowers that turn into the cherries that we roast as beans.More recently, we’ve learned that shade coffee farms cannot do the work of biodiversity conservation alone and that it is important to view coffee farms in the context of a broader landscape. Biodiversity is richer when coffee farms exist within a patchwork that includes intact natural habitats, especially forest.A significant part of that coffee farm biodiversity seems to be ants. What role do they play in coffee agroecosystems?Ants are just fascinating! My main focus has been on the role of ants as biological control agents — as predators in the system. But being predators is not their only role. Many ants also tend hemipterans — things like aphids and scale insects that feed on plant sap and excrete sugar-rich honeydew. Many species of ants have mutualisms with hemipterans. Ants consume a lot of their honeydew, and in exchange protect hemiptera from enemies like parasitoids or predators.In Mexico, one of the dominant and aggressive species of ant, Azteca sericeasur, is a tree-dwelling species that nests on shade trees. So if you eliminate the shade trees you eliminate this species. We examined the positive or negative impacts of this ant on an organic coffee farm in Chiapas.We suspected that these ants could have a negative impact on coffee. Coffee plants surrounded by trees with Azteca nests have a high density of scale insects, a herbivorous coffee pest that reduces yield. These ants are also very nasty to humans, attacking workers pruning coffee trees. Workers deal with this by putting calcium carbonate on nests to calm ants before pruning.Among the complex interactions found on coffee farms are those involving ants, scale insects and lady beetles. Shown here, an Azteca ant attacks the larva of a lady beetle that’s covered in protective waxy white filaments (left) on a coffee plant in Mexico. Left alone, lady beetles will eat the scale insects; the ants like to keep the scale insects around for the sticky honeydew they provide. An ant grabs an adult beetle (right).CREDIT: PHOTOS BY IVETTE PERFECTO / FLICKRBut these aggressive ants also attack other pests, including coffee’s main insect pest — coffee berry borer. So coffee plants that have scale insects are better protected from coffee borer than those without, because these are foraging places for ants.The system is further complicated by other players, including ladybug beetles, white halo fungus and a parasitoid fly that limits ant numbers. In the field and in simulation models, we explored this intricate community dance. We found that close to ant clusters, there is less coffee leaf rust.Is the ant-coffee interaction different in different places?Yes. In Puerto Rico, for example, there are hardly any tree-dwelling ants. A lot of the action takes place on the ground. All of the dominant ant species are non-native species. By mapping their distribution on the ground and on coffee plants, one of the things we have documented is an intransitive loop – a term that means competition in a rock-papers-scissors fashion.People normally think about competition among ant species as a hierarchy: one dominant species, the others subdominant. But in this case, no one species dominates permanently, because once one species starts dominating a particular spot, it gets displaced by another.So you have this loop that happens over time when you look at ant distribution in the coffee farm. You see one area dominated by one species, another area dominated by another species, and a third area dominated by another. So species A beats species B, species B beats species C, but then species C beats species A. It’s like a rock-paper-scissors game in areas that are constantly fluctuating.We are looking at the impact of this on pests of coffee because different ant species have different effects on the herbivores feeding on coffee plants. What is the impact of this intransitivity on the pests being controlled by the ants? That’s what we’re trying to find out.Stay in the KnowSign up for the Knowable Magazine newsletter todayIs there a trade-off for the farmer in terms of maintaining biodiversity on their farms and making a living?Farmers are of course concerned about yields. If you have coffee surrounded by very dense forest, yield goes down. You can argue that because it is conserving biodiversity, that people should pay more for that coffee and compensate for the lower yield.A student of mine did a study in Mexico, where she had coffee productivity data for different shade levels. She found that the peak of productivity is the intermediate level of shade. With too much shade, production goes down. But too little shade, and the production also goes down. If you’re a small-scale farmer that doesn’t use herbicide — because when you don’t have any shade, the farm gets covered with weeds and vines that are very hard to control — then you need to be there all the time cutting the weeds and vines. So you have a hump-shaped curve for productivity and the peak of productivity is between 40 to 60 percent shade.You created a board game for coffee farmers? How was it received?Yes, we developed a game that’s called the Azteca chess game, named after the Azteca ants. The two-person game was designed to help small-scale Mexican coffee farmers better understand the complex interactions between insects and fungi living on coffee plants — and how some of those creatures can help provide natural pest control. In the game, one player is the ant and wasp, the other player is the beetle larva and adult. As these insects, they move around the board by seeking out the resources they need to survive. The beetle wins if it manages to eat all six scale insects on the board. The ant and the parasitoid win if they manage to defeat all the beetles before beetles consume all the scale insects.Farmers were excited to participate in these workshops and to see that the game included organisms that they recognize from their farms. They also commented on how the game helped them have a deeper knowledge of how these animals interacted with each other in nature. We also evaluated their ability to remember the positive and negative interactions among the organisms in the game and found that after playing the game, their ability to remember the animals and their interaction increased significantly when compared to simply receiving the information through a PowerPoint presentation.Small coffee producers play the Azteca chess game in a workshop in southern Mexico.CREDIT: LUIS GARCIA BARRIOSWhat do you hope to see in the future?I would like to see the coffee farmers, first of all, eliminate the use of agrochemicals. I think it’s possible. I work on an organic coffee farm that has been organic for 50 years or more.Then, plant a diversity of shade trees, and if you can, produce a diversity of things, not just coffee but other crops. That would be good for the farmers as well, because they don’t have to rely on this commodity for which they have no control over price. Producing more things promotes biodiversity and buffers them against big price fluctuations.Our research shows that planned biodiversity — what the farmer intentionally includes in the system — has a positive relationship with overall biodiversity. The more diversity of organisms or crops you have there, the more diversity of wildlife you’re going to have.Given your in-depth understanding of coffee agroecosystems, what goes through your mind when you take a sip?I think a lot about the coffee ecosystem as one that is potentially so diverse that it can help maintain biodiversity at the landscape level.That’s what I think about: How was this coffee produced?

N2  - Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the key malaria vector control interventions in Ethiopia. The success of these interventions rely on their efficacy to repel or kill indoor feeding and resting mosquitoes. This study was undertaken to monitor human-biting patterns of Anopheles species in south-central Ethiopia. Human-biting patterns of anophelines were monitored for 40 nights in three houses using human landing catches (HLC) both indoors and outdoors between July and November 2014, in Edo Kontola village, south-central Ethiopia. This time coincides with the major malaria transmission season in Ethiopia, which is usually between September and November. Adult mosquitoes were collected from 19:00 to 06:00 h and identified to species. Comparisons of HLC data were done using incidence rate ratio (IRR) calculated by negative binomial regression. The nocturnal biting activities of each Anopheles species was expressed as mean number of mosquitoes landing per person per hour. To assess malaria infections in Anopheles mosquitoes the presence of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Altogether 3,408 adult female anophelines were collected, 2,610 (76.6 %) outdoors and 798 (23.4 %) indoors. Anopheles zeimanni was the predominant species (66.5 %) followed by An. arabiensis (24.8 %), An. pharoensis (6.8 %) and An. funestus (s.l.) (1.8 %). The overall mean anopheline density was 3.3 times higher outdoors than indoors (65.3 vs 19.9/person/night, IRR: 3.3, 95 % CI: 1.1–5.1, P = 0.001). The mean density of An. zeimanni, An. pharoensis and An. funestus (s.l.) collected outdoors was significantly higher than indoors for each species (P < 0.05). However, the mean An. arabiensis density outdoors was similar to that indoors (11.8 vs 9.4/person/night, IRR: 1.3, 95 % CI: 0.8–1.9, P = 0.335). The mean hourly human-biting density of An. arabiensis was greater outdoors than indoors and peaked between 21:00 and 22:00 h. However, An. arabiensis parous population showed high indoor man biting activities during bedtimes (22:00 to 05:00 h) when the local people were indoor and potentially protected by IRS and LLINs. All mosquito samples tested for CSP antigen were found negative to malaria parasites. Results show much greater mosquito human-biting activities occurring outdoors than indoors and during early parts of the night, implying higher outdoor malaria transmission potential in the area. However, high bedtime (22:00 to 05:00 h) indoor biting activities of parous An. arabiensis suggest high potential intervention impact of IRS and LLINs on indoor malaria transmission.

N2  - The survey was carried out in 2017 main cropping season to support farmers for correct insect pest identification. Three Kebeles, Hallo, Sambaro and Herara with five farmer’s fields randomly selected. Ten representative plants were taken from each field. Data on mean larval density per plant, percentage leaf infestation and damage levels were assessed. Results from mean larval density per plant showed that significant difference between insect species (R2= 0.96, Pr (&gt;|Z|=0.013) where the highest 1.55-2.30 was recorded from C. partellus. There was a significant difference between C. partellus and M. trapezalis; S. frugiperda and M. trapezalis in percentage leaf infestation (R2=0.75, Pr. (&gt;|Z|=2e-16) where, the highest were recorded from C. partellus and S. frugiperda representing 50-90% and 40-90% respectively. From the above, C. partellus and S. frugiperda were at risk, as a result insecticide was recommended. M. trapezalis showed a lower infestation level so that hand picking was more economical than use of insecticide. Hence, registration and detail molecular identification will be needed as M. trapezals is the first record on maize crop in Ethiopia.

N2  - Abstract Since its first detection in 2012 in Djibouti, Anopheles stephensi has invaded and established itself in the Horn of Africa and most recently in Nigeria and Yemen. The expansion of this vector poses a significant threat to malaria control and eliminations efforts. Integrated vector management is the primary strategy used to interrupt disease transmission; however, growing insecticide resistance is threatening to reverse gains in global malaria control. We present a next-generation amplicon-sequencing approach, for high-throughput monitoring of insecticide resistance genes ( ace1, gste2, vgsc and rdl ), species identification and characterization of genetic diversity ( its2 and cox1 ) in An. stephensi . Ninety-five An. stephensi mosquitoes, collected in Ethiopia, were screened, identifying 104 SNPs, including the knock-down mutation L958F (L1014F in Musca domestica ), and for the first time in this vector species, the A296S substitution (A301S in Drosophila melanogaster ) in the rdl locus. Two other amino acid substitutions ( ace1- N177D, GSTe2- V189L) were also identified but have not been previously implicated in insecticide resistance. Genetic diversity in the mitochondrial cox1 gene revealed shared haplotypes between Ethiopian An. stephensi with samples from Pakistan, Sudan, and Djibouti. Overall, we present a reliable, cost-effective strategy using amplicon-sequencing to monitor known insecticide resistance mutations, with the potential to identify new genetic variants, to assist high-throughput surveillance of An. stephensi populations.

N2  - Tapeworms of poultry are a group of cestodes that parasitize the intestinal tract of chickens and other birds. They cause economic losses due to reduced production, growth retardation, weight loss, and mortality. In Ethiopia, several species of tapeworms have been reported in poultry, especially in free-range systems and low land areas. The most common genera are Davainea, Hymenolepis, Amoebotaenia, Choanotaenia, and Raillietina. These tapeworms have complex life cycles that require arthropod or other invertebrate intermediate hosts, such as snails, beetles, ants, and earthworms. The birds become infected by ingesting these intermediate hosts that contain the infective larval stage of the tapeworms. The larvae then attach to the mucosa of the intestine and change themselves to adult tapeworms that produce eggs or proglottids that are passed in the feces. Tapeworm infections can cause various clinical signs and pathological lesions in poultry, depending on the species, number, and location of the worms. Some of the common signs are diarrhea, anorexia, emaciation, weakness, ruffled feathers, slow movement, and rapid breathing. Some tapeworms can also cause intestinal blockage, hemorrhage, nodular growth, and catarrhal enteritis. Tapeworm infections can also predispose the birds to other diseases by impairing their immunity and nutrition. However, other chicken diseases may have similar symptoms and effects like tapeworm infections, so deferential diagnosis should be done at the laboratory level or post-mortem examination. The treatment and control of tapeworm infections in poultry are challenging because of the presence of intermediate hosts that serve as sources of infection. Prevention of birds from contact with intermediate hosts is the most important step that should be taken in the control of tapeworm infection. This can be achieved by improving the hygiene and sanitation of the poultry houses and yards, providing clean water and feed, preventing access to wild birds and rodents that may carry intermediate hosts, and using insecticides or biological agents to reduce intermediate host populations. Tapeworms of poultry are a significant problem in Ethiopia and other tropical countries where free-range systems and low land areas are common. They cause economic losses and affect the health and welfare of poultry. Therefore, more attention should be given to their identification, pathogenicity, public health, and economic importance.

N2  - Abstract Background Indoor residual house spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the key front-line malaria vector interventions against Anopheles arabiensis , the sole primary malaria vector in Ethiopia. Universal coverage of both interventions has been promoted and there is a growing demand in combinations of interventions for malaria control and elimination. This study compared the impact on entomological outcomes of combining IRS and LLINs with either intervention alone in Adami Tullu district, south-central Ethiopia. The epidemiological outcomes were recently published on a separate paper. Methods This factorial, cluster-randomized, controlled trial randomized villages to four study arms: IRS + LLIN, IRS, LLIN, and control. LLINs (PermaNet 2.0) were provided free of charge. IRS with propoxur was applied before the main malaria transmission season in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Adult mosquitoes were collected in randomly selected villages in each arm using CDC light trap catch (LTC) set close to a sleeping person, pyrethrum spray catch (PSC), and artificial pit shelter (PIT), for measuring mosquito host-seeking density (HSD), indoor resting density (IRD), and outdoor resting density (ORD), respectively. Human landing catch (HLC) was performed in a sub-set of villages to monitor An. arabiensis human biting rates (HBR). Mean vector densities and HBR were compared among study arms using incidence rate ratio (IRR) calculated by negative binomial regression. Results There were no significant differences in mean densities (HSD, IRD, ORD) and HBR of An. arabiensis between the IRS + LLIN arm and the IRS arm (p &gt; 0.05). However, mean HSD, IRD, ORD, and HBR were significantly lower in the IRS + LLIN arm than in the LLIN alone arm (p &lt; 0.05). All An. arabiensis tested for malaria infection were negative for Plasmodium species. For this reason, the entomological inoculation rate could not be determined. Conclusions The IRS + LLIN were as effective as IRS alone in reducing densities and HBR of An. arabiensis. However, the effectiveness of the two interventions combined was higher than LLINs alone in reducing densities and HBR of the vector. Added impact of the combination intervention against malaria infectivity rates of An. arabiensis compared to either intervention alone remains unknown and warrants further research.

N2  - Abstract Background Ethiopia continues to grapple with a persistent malaria burden, characterized by ongoing transmission and recurrent outbreaks. Human behavior influences both malaria exposure and the effectiveness of vector interventions, complicating malaria control efforts. Implementing tailored strategies that account for the complex interplay between human activities and vector behavior remains a challenge in both high- and low-transmission areas in Ethiopia, particularly for vulnerable highland populations and temporary labor migrants, due to lack of data. The aim of this study was to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of human—mosquito interactions and evaluate the effectiveness and suitability of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in settings involving lowland resident populations, seasonal migrant workers and highland communities. Methods Concurrent human and vector behavior data were collected from high-transmission lowlands (residents and temporary migrant workers) and vulnerable highlands populations. Hourly human behavior observations (HBOs), which examined LLIN use, indoor versus outdoor human presence and sleeping patterns, were paired in a crossover design with mosquito sampling using US Centers for Disease Control light traps (CDC LT) as a proxy for mosquito biting behavior. The study was conducted during the peak (October–December 2022) and minor (March–May 2023) malaria transmission seasons (‘peak’ and ‘minor’) for a total of 368 nights. In the highlands, four villages consisting of eight households per village were selected for surveillance; in the lowlands, four villages consisting of two resident villages and two farm sites with migrant workers, with eight households/structures per village or farm, were used for data collection. CDC LT and HBO data were integrated to evaluate HBO-adjusted human biting rates (HBO-adjusted HBR) of Anopheles mosquitoes. Results In the highland villages, residents predominantly engaged in indoor activities, with their peak activity overlapping with the peak biting hours (1800-2200 hours). A substantial proportion of inhabitants slept indoors without LLINs in the peak and minor seasons (42.8% and 39.2%, respectively). Highland residents were significantly more exposed to malaria vectors indoors (88.4% peak, 88.6% minor) than outdoors during both transmission seasons. In lowland villages, both resident and seasonal migrant worker populations exhibited predominantly outdoor activity, particularly during peak biting hours (1800-2300 hours). Both residents and temporary migrants were significantly more exposed to Anopheles mosquitoes outdoors (resident: 65.0% peak, 67.1% minor; migrant: 70.5% peak, 80.0% minor) than indoors during both transmission seasons. LLIN usage was minimal and offered limited protection, with &lt; 16.63% of person-time spent under nets by resident populations and 10.7% by migrant workers. Conclusions Malaria control in Ethiopia requires context-specific strategies tailored to diverse ecological settings that consider the impact of human behavior on exposure to Anopheles mosquitoes. Limited LLIN effectiveness, human activities coinciding with peak biting times and minimal LLIN usage create significant protection gaps. Comprehensive control necessitates supplemental tools addressing exposure in all locations and times. In the Ethiopian highlands, where indoor activities predominate, increased LLIN usage combined with targeted indoor residual spraying could reduce transmission. In lowland areas, both residents and seasonal migrant workers face relatively higher outdoor exposure risks, requiring additional measures, such as topical and spatial repellents. We recommend implementing data-driven, hyperlocal approaches based on specific human—vector interactions to enhance malaria control effectiveness across the Ethiopian highlands and lowlands.

N2  - In Ethiopia, the national agricultural research system has been generating and disseminating different agricultural technologies since its establishment in 1966. Although these technologies are meant to increase agricultural productivity, they have to be evaluated for their impact on production and for the benefit that the farmers get out of them. Hence, the main objectives of this study were to examine the impact of technological innovations on wheat production and to decompose the total change in wheat output resulting from the introduction of new technologies into its constituent parts. Cobb-Douglas production function was employed to estimate the regression coefficients under old variety growers, new variety growers, and pooled data cases. Output decomposition model was applied to decompose the total change in output into its constituent parts. The econometric results of this study indicated that, out of 55% of the observed productivity difference between old and new variety grown plots, technological change and change in associated input levels contributed about 24% and 31%, respectively. Of the 31% increment attributed to input use levels, an increased use of herbicides and fertilizers caused the biggest jump in the productivity of improved wheat varieties (15.5% and 11% respectively). The major implications included the need to exploit the full potential of new varieties using recommended input levels, strengthening the research system, fostering coordinated efforts among various actors in agricultural development, and strengthening the technology instrument in rural development and poverty reduction strategies of the country.

N2  - &lt;p class="Default"&gt;In the lowlands of arid and semiarid rangelands woody plants&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;plays an important role in soil fertility maintenance, providing food, medicine, cosmetics, fodder, fuel wood and pesticides. A better understanding of the interaction of woody plants on their immediate environment is needed to guide optimum management of native vegetation in the production landscapes. However, the impact of woody plant species on soil properties remains poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of two dominant woody plant species (&lt;em&gt;A. senegal and B. aegyptica&lt;/em&gt;) on soil physico-chemical properties along grazing gradients in rangelands of eastern Ethiopia. Six trees of each species were selected from light, moderate and heavy grazing sites. Soil sample data at two depths (0-15 and 16-30 cm) were collected from under and open areas of &lt;em&gt;A. senegal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B. aegyptica&lt;/em&gt; from each grazing sites, and analysed for nutrient contents. The nutrient status of soil under both woody species was significantly higher especially with regard to soil organic matter (4.37%), total nitrogen (0.313%), and available phosphorus (11.62) than the open grassland with soil organic matter (3.82%), total nitrogen (0.246%), and available phosphorus (10.94 mg/Kg soil) for&lt;em&gt; A. Senegal&lt;/em&gt;. The soil organic matter (3.93%), total nitrogen (0.285%), available phosphorus (11.66 mg/Kg soil) were significantly higher than open grassland with soil organic matter (3.52%), total nitrogen (0.218%), available phosphorus (10.73 mg/Kg soil) for&lt;em&gt; B. aegyptica&lt;/em&gt;. This was more pronounced in the top 15 cm of soil under &lt;em&gt;A. senegal&lt;/em&gt; woody plant species and on the light and moderate grazing site. Therefore, this tree has a significant effect on soil fertility improvement in resource poor rangelands and as a result, it is important to retain scattered &lt;em&gt;A. senegal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;B. aegyptica&lt;/em&gt; plants in the lowlands of eastern Ethiopia.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

N2  - This study was aimed at examining the impacts of climate variability on vegetable production and nexus climate-smart agriculture technologies. The study was conducted on vegetable farmers along the little Akaki River in Addis Ababa. Field data was collected from 156 randomly selected vegetable farmers via semi-structured survey questions. Climate data from 1996 to 2020 was analysed using qualitative and quantitative descriptive statistics methods. The results of monthly and annual precipitation variability indicated a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 23% to 73% and 49% to 98%, respectively. Seasonally, CV ranges between 34% and 99%, 50%–97%, and 20%–84% in Belg, Bega, and Kiremt, respectively. The results of respondents' perceptions indicated an increasing trend in temperature and precipitation variability. Vegetable urban farmers perceived an increase in the frequency of floods and rain falls (44.9%), drought frequency (13.5%), temperature (89.7%), and a decrease in the trend of vegetable productivity (86.5%) as the major impacts of climate variability. However, changing vegetable varieties (31.4%), early planting (26.9%), mixed farming (26.6%), late planting (5.1%), using agrochemicals (4.5%), and agroforestry (1.9%) are the major on-farm climates where smart agriculture technologies were identified for adaptation. Shift occupation (37.8%), nonadaptation (36.5%), and non-farm activations (24.4%) were employed by the farmers as off-farm adaptation options. In addition, vulnerability analysis indicated that the absence of direct access to the market, inadequate access to weather information, land fragmentation, and tenure complications are the major determinants of being vulnerable. Finally, high precipitation and temperature variability affect vegetable productivity. Climate extreme phenomena are substantial pressures on urban agricultural production systems in risk-prone cities, where climate service challenges are rising globally (Sanfo et al., 2022, Kifle et al., 2022, Ebissa and Desta, 2022); besides, the requirement to produce more urban vegetables to feed residents, an ever-increasing and vulnerable group, is undeniable (Martinez et al., 2022). Additionally, climate variability and change threaten urban and pre-urban farmers' livelihoods and agricultural farming, particularly in semi-arid areas in Africa (Magesa et al., 2023). Furthermore, 64 % of the world's poorest people lived in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020, which strongly requires the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger) and 11 (make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable) in the region (Magesa et al., 2023, Chitakira and Ngcobo, 2021, Degefu et al., 2021c). Thus, cities are exposure to compatible climate information services is vital for anticipating climate variability risks in vegetable production, optimizing the training of practitioners (urban farmers), and adapting to climate change through climate smart agriculture technologies (Degefu et al., 2021a, Chitakira and Ngcobo, 2021, Kifle et al., 2022). Moreover, it is compulsory to ascertain and analyze impact insights and their origins, vulnerabilities, and adaptive potential among urban farmers before beginning with the exercise of any given climate service to understand the demands of urban vegetable farmers and the possible exploitation of nexuses (Dendir and Simane, 2021). Conversely, in Ethiopia, the agriculture sector is identified as one of the sectors most vulnerable to climate change and vulnerability (Kifle et al., 2022). On top of these, the productivity and the concern of urban agriculture (vegetable production) is highly ignored and reduced the potential, productivity and suitability of ecological land (Kifle et al., 2022, Degefu et al., 2021b, Degefu et al., 2021c). Besides, the combined effect of climate variability, population pressure, and urban ecosystem dynamics reduced urban vegetable production and leads the farming community into a viscous of poverty circle and worsens food security (Amberber et al., 2020, Degefu et al., 2021c). However, previous studies have revealed that the effectiveness of climate information services on urban ecosystems depends on (i) the ability of urban farmers to access, understand, and overcome institutional constraints (Kiplagat et al., 2022) (ii) the capacity of end-users to translate the information and knowledge into effective decision-making options (Dendir and Simane, 2021), and (iii) the capacity of end-users to translate the information and knowledge into effective decision-making options (Martinez et al., 2022). To that end, the disparity between the awareness of urban farmers and policymakers towards the benefits of CSA and their practices implies that indigenous knowledge-based research on CSA farming and land management technology should be conducted. Therefore, it is crucial to appreciate the practices and adoption of CSA at the city level to realise triple-win outcomes: increased productivity, enhanced resilience, and mitigating climate variability and change.

N2  - The area around Lake Ziway in Ethiopia is going through a major agricultural transformation with both small-scale farmers and large horticultural companies using pesticides and fertilisers at an increased rate. To be able to understand how this influences the water quality of Lake Ziway, water quality data was gathered to study the dynamics of pesticide concentrations and physicochemical parameters for the years from 2009 to 2015. Results indicate that for some physicochemical parameters, including pH, potassium and iron, over 50 % of the values were above the maximum permissible limit of the Ethiopian standard for drinking water. The fungicide spiroxamine poses a high chronic risk when the water is used for drinking water, while the estimated intake of diazinon was approximately 50 % of the acceptable daily intake. Higher-tier risk assessment indicated that the fungicide spiroxamine poses a high acute risk to aquatic organisms, while possible acute risks were indicated for the insecticides deltamethrin and endosulfan. Longer-term monitoring needs to be established to show the water quality changes across time and space, and the current study can be used as a baseline measurement for further research in the area as well as an example for other surface water systems in Ethiopia and Africa.

N2  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), known as kala azar, is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania transmitted by sand flies which causes about 59 000 deaths per year and 2.4 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost (World Health Report 2002). India is the most affected country in the world and, together with Bangladesh and Nepal, accounts for about 300 000 cases annually and thus 60% of the global burden of the disease. In the three Indian subcontinent countries, kala azar is endemic in 109 districts and an estimated 190 million people are at risk of infection. The actual incidence rate of the disease is estimated to be about 8–10 times higher than the reported one in all three countries (Singh et al. 2006). More than 50% of the cases are reported from the border districts and an extension to new geographical areas has been observed. The disease occurs predominantly among the poorest of poor (Alvar et al. 2006). Because of breeding habits and focal distribution of the sand fly vector, cases tend to cluster in households. On the Indian subcontinent, the mode of transmission is anthroponotic. Humans with kala azar provide the major reservoir for ongoing transmission; post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), though comparatively rare, is a chronic reservoir for initiation of an outbreak. A major challenge is the detection and management of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections which are the source and reservoir for leishmanial infections. Asymptomatic persons considerably outnumber symptomatic patients but the risk factors that influence the progression from asymptomatic infection to full blown disease are not yet clearly understood. Malnutrition is one risk factor for severe forms of the disease (Cerf et al. 1987). The governments of Bangladesh, India and Nepal joined forces in 2005 to eliminate the disease from the region. The target is to reduce the incidence rate to below 1/10 000 at district level in India by the year 2010 and at sub-district level in Bangladesh and Nepal by the year 2015. The elimination strategy includes early diagnosis and complete treatment, effective disease and vector surveillance, vector control through integrated vector management including residual spraying, insecticide treated bed nets, if evidences are supportive, and environmental management, social mobilisation and implementation research. However, in the affected areas the primary health centres are ill-equipped, skilled personnel is often not available and laboratory diagnosis not feasible. Vector control measures such as residual insecticide spraying and the use of insecticide-treated bed nets or curtains, which offer effective protection, are frequently poorly implemented and often beyond the means of families. The cost of VL diagnostic and treatment is largely borne by the patient’s family, enforcing the vicious cycle of poverty and disease (Alvar et al. 2006; Meheus et al. 2006). In the context of the elimination initiative, TDR/WHO supported implementation research is being undertaken by investigators of the three countries to identify cost-effective strategies for active case finding and Primary Health Care based case management (Mondal et al., unpublished data) as well as efficient high quality vector control interventions (Anand et al., unpublished data). The review of VL diagnosis and treatment options presented here will feed into research about the feasibility of house-to-house detection of new cases and of decentralized patient management and requirements for drug safety monitoring. In April 2007, an Expert Meeting organised and supported by the UNICEF/UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) and the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) on behalf of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development was held with experts in clinical medicine, research and programme management. The major goal of the meeting was to review the challenges related to VL case detection and management in the implementation of the regional and national elimination plans, to look at efforts made with regard to diagnostics and treatment and to provide inputs into the design of ongoing implementation research activities. Adequate diagnosis is critical for VL and the demonstration of parasites in the spleen is considered the gold standard (Sundar et al. 2007). However, routine microscopy misses about 17% of kala azar cases (Sundar et al. 2007) and availability of PCR, the most reliable diagnostic means, is limited to well equipped laboratories. During the last years, several tests have become available for field diagnosis of leishmanial infection, all displaying advantages and disadvantages. TDR had commissioned two studies, one in Africa in Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan and one in India and Nepal, for comparative evaluation of the serological tests with parasitological diagnosis in field settings (Sundar et al. 2006, 2007). Of the two tests the DAT-FD (Direct Agglutination Test, freeze-dried) and the rK39 strip test which performed equally well with regard to sensitivity, DAT has the advantage of being a semi-quantitative test, but has several drawbacks that make it less suitable as a field test. It requires multiple pipetting and takes long because of the necessity of overnight incubation. Once the freeze dried antigen is dissolved, it needs to be kept refrigerated until the entire vial is consumed. This is problematic in peripheral health centres where patients do not present in groups. The rK39 test (rK39 immunochromatographic strip test) is simple enough to be performed by a trained paramedic without any equipment and the results are unambiguous. The test can be stored at room temperature and has a shelf life of 18 months. Although the manufacturers recommend use of serum because of FDA approval, there is extensive experience using blood including that from finger prick (Sundar et al. 1998, 2007b). The test detects Leishmania antibodies. It does not differentiate between active or past or sub-clinical infections. It is currently the most convenient test for peripheral areas of endemic regions. The price of the rK39 test is about 1 US$ compared with US$1.5–2.5 for the DAT-FD (Sundar et al. 2007). The KAtex (Latex Agglutination Test) detecting Leishmania antigen has limitations in sensitivity. It uses urine which needs to be boiled for 10 min, again a procedure which is problematic for field application. The price is about US$1.5. Pentavalent antimonial compounds are the recommended treatment in all parts of the world except for Bihar, India, where 60% of previously untreated patients did not respond to the WHO-recommended treatment of 20 mg for 30–40 days (Sundar 2001). Antimony is toxic and has a treatment related fatality rate of 3–5%. Conventional amphotericin B is therefore currently the drug of choice in Bihar. It achieves a high cure rate of more than 95% but the drug has to be applied in 15–20 daily infusions or on alternate days, for about 1 month. Infusion reactions are frequent and fatal toxicity occurs in 1%. The patient may die of a test dose because of anaphylactic shock. Treatment therefore requires close clinical and laboratory monitoring restricting amphotericin B administration to hospital care. India, at least Bihar, does not have the capacity to admit that many patients for such long periods. Furthermore, the supply of the drug is irregular in the public sector; it is more expensive than antimony and not affordable in the private sector (Sundar et al. 2004). Over the last years, significant progress has been made in developing alternative treatments. In cooperation with WHO/TDR, Miltefosine, the first and only oral drug for the treatment of VL, has become more widely available. The development of oral therapy with miltefosine and simple rapid diagnosis with rK39 has led to the Indian subcontinent initiative to eliminate kala azar by year 2015 (TDR 2005). Miltefosine was chosen as the first line drug for the elimination programme. It is given at a dosage of 100 mg/day for 28 days and yields a cure rate of 94% in adults and children (Sundar et al. 2002). Miltefosine was also shown to cure antimony refractory cases. Although a very valuable drug, it does have several drawbacks especially with regard to application at community level: as observed in phase III and IV studies, 2–3% of patients develop severe adverse reactions in the gastrointestinal tract or skin allergy; 1.3% of these have severe vomiting or diarrhoea, 0.6% renal toxicity and up to 1.2% have raised hepatic enzymes (Bhattacharya et al. 2007). The drug is contraindicated in pregnancy and contraception is necessary at childbearing age and during breastfeeding. Home treatment is possible but because of its long half life it has a high potential to develop resistance. Compliance needs to be ensured through strictly supervised public distribution system (Sundar & Murray 2005). Paromomycin, developed by iOWH and TDR, supported by a grant of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was recently licensed and is produced in India. It yields a cure rate of 94.6% (Sundar et al. 2007a). In phase III trials, side effects such as ototoxicity were reversible while nephrotoxicity was not observed. So far, the only major drawback is that it needs to be injected over 21 days and causes pain at the injection site in half of the patients. With a cost of 10 US$ per treatment course, it is affordable and may qualify as a replacement of antimony and conventional amphotericin B in the future. Liposomal amphotericin B (i. e. AmBisome, Gilead Sciences) has the highest therapeutic index of current antileishmanial drugs. A single dose was shown to cure more than 91% of patients (Sundar et al. 2001a). The liposomal formulation has substantially lower toxicity than conventional amphotericin B, no serious adverse reactions were observed. Because of its excellent safety profile, lipocomal amphotericin B is considered by most VL experts as the drug of choice for VL treatment (Aparicio 2007), and is used as first-line treatment in Europe. Phase III and IV trials should be planned to confirm the safety and single dose effectiveness. Very recently and after extensive advocacy by WHO, Gilead Sciences made AmBisome available at a WHO negotiated price of US$20 per 50 mg vial for VL to be distributed through the public health system. The high costs which so far excluded its use in most endemic areas are therefore no longer the stumbling block, and newer vistas open up in the treatment of VL. Despite initial high efficacy demonstrated by every antileishmanial drug, there is a lurking danger of development of increasing unresponsiveness with passage of time contributed by poor compliance, inherent nature of the drugs, and inefficient public health systems. Thus, there is a need to develop short course multidrug regimens to ensure compliance, and prolong the effective lives of the drugs. The reduced AmBisome price provides several options for these combination therapies. There is a rationale for agencies like TDR, DNDi, Gates Foundation to invest in developing effective short course combinations. As reported at the meeting, the TDR-initiated implementation research revealed an average annual incidence rate of kala azar in the three countries of 21/10.000 (TDR multi centre study, in preparation). To detect one case with fever and a positive rK39 test, 300 households would have to be visited. The recent finding that living within the same household as or within a range of 50 meters of an active case increases the risk of infection by a factor 25, indicates strong clustering and points to a role of active kala azar patients as a predominant infection reservoir (Bern et al. 2005). The delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis, as well as the delay between diagnosis and start of treatment was longer than three weeks in India in 50% of patients (TDR multi centre study, in preparation). This delay provides opportunity for endophagic sand flies to become infected and transmit infection. There is clear ground for optimism based on the strong political will which lead to increased funding and the establishment of a Regional Technical Advisory Group (RTAG), improved diagnostics and drugs as well as joint research activities generating evidence for cost-effective public health interventions in the VL elimination initiative. Implementation research will show how the existing health systems in Bangladesh, India and Nepal and already overburdened health workers will be able to cope with yet another task - active case detection of kala azar and treatment of a growing number of patients. In addition, a coordinated effort among the three countries to manage the trans-border flux of cases is needed. From the public health view and guided by research evidence, investment of resources into transmission control and a strong integration of early diagnosis and treatment into the existing health services and improvement of access to diagnosis and treatment for the marginalized poor will be favourable options to reach the goal of elimination of kala azar by the year 2015.

N2  - The objective of this review article was to summarize the current impacts and its implications of environmental pollution on the fisheries sector in Ethiopian fisheries. The materials for this review were kinds of literature (published and unpublished) including internet access and personal experiences were used for the source to obtain applicable data. Ethiopia has a potential source of water used for fisheries and irrigation-based agriculture. The Ethiopian Rift Valley is one of the potential sources used for fisheries purposes and it is also the most environmentally vulnerable water source in the country. Climate changes and environmental pollutions affect the fisheries and aquaculture sector directly by influencing the fish stocks and the comprehensive supply of fish for consumption. In Ethiopia, environmental pollutions are significantly affected the fisheries sector, especially in the Rift valley areas which come from different sources. 92.8% of the liquid sewages released from Addis Ababa city enter into rivers and rain-water channels having a chain with Lakes along with the downstream with above the maximum permissible levels of BOD and COD. And, applications of commercial agricultural fertilizers including pesticides and floriculture significantly affected the water qualities of Ethiopian water bodies especially the central Rift Valley lakes and, currently, the affluence and availabilities including the fish quality and the ecosystem services under the down streams are found at risk. The accumulation of nutrients affects biodiversity and fisheries. Under Rift valley lakes, 73% of the fish landing is sold nearby markets and the consumption of fish that are contaminated through different concentrations of heavy metals above permissible levels is going to be toxic for human beings. Therefore, the government and respective bodies should give more emphasis on the mitigations and management's especially with agricultural, floriculture, and urbanization related waste entered into the water bodies; affects the ecosystem and the fishery sector in the country.

N2  - Thirteen bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars popular in thehighlands of Ethiopia and representative of the period from 1949 to1987 were studied for two cropping seasons in Ethiopia to estimateprogress made in improving grain yield. The selected cultivars weregrown with the effects of other genetic changes minimized by usingfungicides to control foliar diseases, nets to prevent lodging, andperiodic hand weeding to control weeds. Adequate levels of nutrientswere also supplied. Significant differences were observed amongcultivars for all crop parameters studied. The grain yield of breadwheat cultivars released since 1949 has increased at a mean rate of 77kg ha-1yr-1 (2.21%) as measured in central Ethiopia and 50 Kgha-1y-1(1.77%) under warmer and drier conditions in southeasternEthiopia. Grain Yield was significantly and positively correlated withharvest index, grains m-2, spikelets spike-1 and grains spike-1.Genetic improvement has substantially increased the grain yield ofrainfed bread wheat in the highlands of Ethiopia, resulting from animproved harvest index associated with an increased number of grainsspike-1 and, as a result, grains m-2. Wheat breeders in Ethiopia shouldcontinue to emphasize spike fertility as a selection criterion for highgrain yield.

N2  - Recent micro level data from East Africa is used to benchmark aggregate data and assess the role of agricultural inputs in explaining variation in crop yields on smallholding plots. Fertilizer, improved seeds, protection against erosion and pesticides improve crop yields in Rwanda and Ethiopia, but not Uganda, possibly associated with lack of use there. With all positive yield determinants in place, wheat and maize yields could increase fourfold. The data hints at the negative effect of climate change on yields and the benefits of accompanying measures to mitigate its adverse impact (access to finance and protection against erosion). The adverse effect of crop damage on yields varies between 12/13 percent (Rwanda, Uganda) to 36 percent (Ethiopia). Protection against erosion and investment financing mitigate these effects considerably.

N2  - Background: Standard indicators of malaria prevention interventions, such as ownership and use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs), are restricted to the population at risk of getting malaria. Household survey measurements of those indicators, however, are typically reported at the national level, including areas with little or no malaria transmission. Moreover, many surveys are not conducted during the high malaria transmission season. For these reasons, estimates of coverage by malaria interventions are often biased downward. This paper quantifies the effect of these biases by examining two coverage measures for universal coverage: 1) household possession of at least one ITN (HP1+) and 2) at least one ITN for every two usual residents (HP1/2), byA)Using GPS data to correlate these measures with levels of malaria endemicity and seasonality, andB)Recalculating coverage estimates based on the population at risk, taking into account the timing of the survey and endemicity in the area. Methods: Data come from 15 recent sub-Saharan Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) or Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS). GPS location of household cluster is linked with Malaria Atlas Project maps to evaluate the malaria transmission zone and season. Results: The percentage of HP1+ households varies from 3.4% in Ethiopia to 53.3% in Zambia, and the percentage of HP1/2 households varies from 0.4% in Ethiopia to 18% in Zambia. If the estimates are restricted to households located in endemic areas, coverage is considerably higher. For example, HP1/2 universal coverage is 6% nationwide in Namibia, but ranges from 2% in areas with no malaria to 11% in highly endemic areas (with parasitemia >40%). Rates of ITN use also differ substantially: in Uganda, 11% of the population in highly endemic areas interviewed during the malaria season slept under ITNs, compared to only 3% in areas with no malaria. Conclusion: Estimates of ITN ownership and use based on household surveys are strongly affected by the location of survey clusters and the month of the interview. Taking these factors into account is recommended to improve the monitoring of progress toward achieving national goals and to inform in-country programmatic decision-making.

N2  - Bean anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (Sacc. &amp; Magnus) Briosi &amp; Cavara is one of the most devastating seed-borne diseases of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Ethiopia. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the antifungal activities of bioagents and fungicides which can be used to control bean anthracnose. Three fungicides viz., Mancozeb, Folpan and Mancolaxyl, and three bioagents viz., Trichoderma harzianum Rifai, Trichoderma viride Pers. Fr. and Pseudomonas fluorescens Migula, were screened in vitro for their antifungal activities against common bean anthracnose, C. lindemuthianum using the dual culture and microtitre double-dilution techniques. Antagonistic effects of the three bioagents tested by the dual culture method showed highly significant (P&lt;0.01) percentage of inhibition of the mycelia germination of C. lindemuthianum. The highest percentage of inhibition of the mycelia germination (80.39%) was obtained from T. viride, followed by 75.49% from T. harzianum and 40.2% from P. fluorescens. Similarly, highly significant (P&lt;0.01) differences were observed in the radial growth of mycelia of C. lindemuthianum. The highest growth of mycelia (3.4 cm) was measured from the control (C. lindemuthianum), whereas the least (0.67 cm) was obtained from the dual culture containing T. viride. The in vitro assays revealed that all the antagonistic bioagents produced siderophores which were capable of inhibiting mycelia growth of the pathogen. The mancozeb fungicide was found to be fatal to C. lindemuthianum at four different concentrations poisoned on potato dextrose agar medium. Key words: Bio agents, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, dual culture, fungicides, in vitro, Phaseolus vulgaris.

N2  - Agriculture is the foundation of economy for Ethiopia. The majority of people in the study area rely on rain-fed subsistence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, smallholder farmers were more susceptible to climate change due to their reliance on a single rain season and lack of climate change adaptation technologies. The sustainability of food crop production, which employs the majority of the labor force in the nation, is threatened by climate change. The study's objectives were to look at indigenous and improved adaptation technologies in reaction to local climate change effects and barriers to adaptation among smallholder farmers. A closed-ended, semi-structured questionnaire was used to gather the data from 400 smallholder farmer household heads. An analysis of the variables influencing farmers' decisions regarding climate change adaptation was conducted using binary logistic regression model. The fitness and accuracy of the model were examined using an omnibus test of model coefficients. The study's findings showed that absence of crop insurance, a lack of training and demonstration, a lack of non-farm employment, a lack of weather forecasting and early warning, shortage of finance, the high price of farm inputs, and reliance on a single rain season were the main barriers preventing farmers from adapting to climate change. The most popular indigenous adaptation techniques used by smallholder farmers included mixed cropping of local variety, reducing social and religious rituals, mixed farming (local crop and livestock), and reducing the amount of food consumed. The primary improved adaptation strategies used by the farmers included the use of chemical fertilizers, various agrochemicals, and soil and water conservation methods. The binary logistic regression model's findings showed that access to extension services by household heads significantly and favorably influenced farmers' decisions to scale back social and religious rituals, reduce food consumption, sell livestock, and adopt improved mixed farming as a means of adapting to climate change. Farm experience significantly influenced the farmers’ decision to practice improved mixed farming; access to the market significantly affected farmers’ decision on soil and water conservation practices; and the age of the respondents significantly influenced the farmers’ decision to practice improved crop variety as a response to climate change adaptation. The study's conclusions showed that a number of factors limited farmers' attempts to adapt to climate change. The study recommends that decisions regarding adaptation plans should concentrate on reducing these barriers.

N2  - This study was conducted to investigate the knowledge gaps regarding the use of agrochemicals by the farming communities in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia and its impact on beekeeping, crop and livestock production. The primary data were collected through household surveys, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and researchers’ observations. A total of 540 farmers (270 beekeepers and 270 non-beekeepers) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. The survey data was analyzed using SPSS software version 21, while the qualitative data was analyzed using content analysis. The results revealed that beekeeping contributes significantly to the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in the Amhara Region, mainly through the provision of hive products for home consumption and income but also for pollination services. The trends in the past decade showed that honeybee colony holdings and hive productivity had decreased due to indiscriminate use of agrochemicals, among others. Both beekeeper and non-beekeeper farmers in the study areas have been using different types of agrochemicals to control crop pests, diseases and weeds, and in some areas farmers used herbicides to clear weeds from pastureland. Farmers also stated that they are already aware of the negative effects of agrochemicals on honeybees. Nevertheless, the applications of agrochemicals are continuing without attitudinal changes. The results also showed that farmers purchase agrochemicals from legal as well as illegal vendors without proper understanding of their safe use and the expiry dates. Farmers’ use of agrochemicals in violation of the technical recommendations on their proper applications; they ignore risks and safety instructions, use unsafe storage facilities, do not use protective devices when applying agrochemicals, and dispose of agrochemical containers unsafely. The findings demonstrated that apart from the direct effects on honeybees, indiscriminate and inappropriate application of agrochemicals even poses risks to the lives of farmers. Beekeepers, non-beekeepers and both crop and livestock experts revealed that nowadays IPM has not been used by farmers as an alternative to synthetic agrochemicals. Farmers are also unaware of the legal frameworks available to protect honeybees from the negative effects of agrochemicals, and they have not developed local bylaws that can be used by farming communities to protect honeybees from the negative effects of agrochemicals. The results also showed that the direct economic losses incurred due to the loss of honey bee colonies from the indiscriminate application of agrochemicals run into ETB 11,520,000.00 /USD422,133.00/. Thus, the indiscriminate use of agrochemicals has become one of the major threats to the development of beekeeping, crop and livestock production. Therefore, very strong actions are needed by concerned and responsible stakeholders to save the lives of honeybees. The interventions to reduce agrochemical exposure should be implemented through context-specific and integrated approaches.

N2  - This fruit devastating pest of white mango scale (Aulacaspis tubercularis Newstead; Hempitera: Diaspididae) insect is an economically important pest and damages the mango fruit by sucking the sap through its piercing-sucking mouth part from mango leaves and fruits. Since the 2010 outbreak in Ethiopia due to a poor internal quarantine system this insect pest was distributed and invaded the whole mango-producing region in the country. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the infestation and severity status of WMS insects to get evidence for upcoming management investigations. The survey was carried out at Boloso Bombe and Boloso Sore districts in South Ethiopia Wolaita Zone in 2023. Among mango-producing farmers by using a semi-structural questionnaire 45 farmers were intervened through random selection. Geographic location and ten samples of mango leaf were collected from four cardinal directions per tree of each stop for examining the infestation and severity status of WMS. The occurrence of this pest at study locations was in 2016 as interviewed farmers respond. Since then, due to a lack of attention by farmers currently, it was distributed and covered the whole study area. As confirmed by this study the infestation ranged from 60 to 100% and damage or severity rated from moderate to very high. Among surveyed locations, 29% of mango farms were very highly, 52% highly and 20% moderately damaged. From the total study area, almost 31% of mango farms reduced 100% yield and the reduction of yield ranged from 50% to 100%. Before the outbreak of this invasive insect pest, the study area farmers were harvesting nearly 272 kg of mango fruit per tree and at normal times yield reduction was almost 43 kg per tree. After the prevalence of WMS insect per tree yield was almost 44 kg and the reduction of yield was alarmingly increased to 228 kg per tree as shown by this study data. Even though this insect pest is a devastating pest of mango fruit, however, it can be controlled through different management practices. Therefore, the management practice of this pest is categorized into three such as cultural, biological and biochemical. Culturally managed by Mango tree pruning, planting resistant materials, using proper spacing, cleaning or sanitation, burying infected residues and fruits, smoking different repellents of dry grass, animal dung, mango leaves and lemon bark or lemon mixed organic materials in one smoking can/pot and hanging inside mango tree. Foliar Spraying of various botanical extracts such as Neem seed extract (Azadirachta indica). Several concoctions made from ash, soap and goat urine were mixed and sprayed on infested mango fruit leaves and twigs. Various predators and parasitoids are used as Biological control. Soil drenching of systemic chemical insecticides also can control this insect pest. The way to control this serious damage and hinder the expansion of this invasive insect pest, integrated experimental investigation using the above-explained mechanisms will be advisable to enhance mango fruit yield.

N2  - Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is the most important oilseed crop in Ethiopia. It is basically grown during the summer season in different regions of the country and produced mainly in the northern and northwestern lowlands of Ethiopia. The production of sesame is low because of insect pests such as sesame webworm, sesame seed bug and gall midge. Among these pests, sesame webworm is one of the most important insect pests and it attacks the crop at all growth stages and causes a significant yield loss. Therefore, the present study was aimed to assess the infestation and avoidable yield losses of sesame due to sesame webworm on different released sesame varieties at field conditions. A field experiment was conducted to assess the infestation and yield losses with respective cost-benefit of nine released sesame varieties to sesame webworm in paired plots (treated with Diazinon 60% EC and untreated) in RCBD with three replications in 2016 production year. There was a significant difference (p&lt;0.001) between the protected and unprotected plots of each variety in leaf, flower and capsule injury. Protection of sesame from the webworm with insecticide effectively reduced leaf (0.02%), flower (&lt;2%) and pod (&lt;1%) damage to very low levels, On the other hand, the unprotected sesame had high levels of infestation. The highest capsule injury was recorded on BaHa-Necho (9.68%) and varieties Adi, Setit-2 and Borkena sustained &lt;5% capsule injury. Grain yield was also increased significantly (p&lt;0.001) in the protected plots of the nine varieties as compared to their corresponding unprotected plots. Maximum yield was obtained from Setit-2, Setit-1, Humera-1 and Higher in both treated and untreated plots. The highest avoidable yield losses were obtained from Adi, Gonder-1, BaHa-Necho, and BaHa-Zeyit with respective cost-benefit ratio 2.27, 2.02, 2.12 and 2.03. Therefore integration of sowing the varieties Setit-2, Setit-1, Humera-1 and Hirhir and spraying with Diazinon 60 EC, at a rate of one liter per hectare at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after crop emergence (WAE) has potential to reduce the yield losses of sesame due to sesame webworm infestation and to increase yield of sesame.

N2  - Onion is a popular vegetable crop, which has been produced for its daily uses and economic benefits. Downey mildew caused by the fungus &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Peronospora&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;destructor&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is among the most important yield-reducing factor in onion production. The effect of three different levels of plant population and fungicide frequency with two different fungicides was studied on downy mildew severity and yield of onion. Nineteen treatment of this Experiment included two fungicides mancozeb + metalaxyl and copper hydrox-ide, three different spraying interval with (10 days, 15 days and 21 days) and three level of plant population (0.71, 0.95 and 1.2 million plants/ha). The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design with three replications for two year at Fogera and for one year at Dera districts of South Gondar zone Ethiopia. Data on disease severity, bulb yield, bulb number and bulb size were recorded during the time of harvest. The price of bulb yield was assessed from the local market and the total price of the yield obtained from each treatment was computed on hectare basis. Input costs like seed, fungicides and labor were converted into hectare basis according to their frequencies used. Fungicides cost was estimated based on the price of the local market. Cost of the labor was in Birr per man-days; cost of spray and spray equipment to spray per hectare were also calculated. Based on the obtained data from the above mentioned parameters economic analysis was performed. The lowest disease severity was recorded in treatment were lowest level of plant population (0.71 million plant/hectare) spraying with fungicide mancozeb + metalaxyl within 15days interval. In this treatment bulb yield and bulb weight were the highest. The economic evaluation showed that the highest net benefit with acceptable marginal rate of return was obtained from T3 (0.71million plants/ha spraying with fungicide mancozeb + metalaxyl within 15days interval).

N2  - Introduction and Aim: Rubus steudneri Schweinf. and Rubus apetalus Poir. belonging to the family Rosaceae is one of the ethnomedicinal plants used widely in Ethiopia as food, for construction and as medicine. To the best of our knowledge, insecticidal activity of R. steudneri and R. apetalus has not been investigated so far. In this study, we report insecticidal efficacy of R. steudneri and R. apetalus in terms of larvicidal effect against II and III instar larvae of Aedes and Culex mosquitoes.&#x0D; Materials and Methods: The shade-dried and powdered leaves were extracted using methanol by maceration process. Insecticidal activity of leaf extract was determined by larvicidal assay against II and III instar larvae of Aedes and Culex species. LC50 and LC90 values were calculated.&#x0D; Results: The leaf extract of both Rubus species exhibited concentration dependent larvicidal effect. II instar larvae were shown to be highly susceptible than III instar larvae. Among leaf extracts, extract of R. steudneri exhibited marked insecticidal activity when compared to extract of R. apetalus as revealed by lower LC50 and LC90 values. Culex larvae displayed marked susceptibility to leaf extracts when compared to Aedes larvae.&#x0D; Conclusion: Marked larvicidal effect was observed against larvae of Culex species when compared to Aedes species as indicated by lower LC50 and LC90 values. It is evident that the leaf extracts of both Rubus contain insecticidal principles.

N2  - <title>Abstract</title> Malaria remains a key contributor to mortality and morbidity across Africa, with the highest burden in children under five. Insecticide based vector control tools, which target the adult <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito are the most efficacious tool in disease prevention. Due to the widespread use of these interventions, insecticide resistance is now ubiquitous across Africa. Understanding the underlying mechanisms contributing to this phenotype is necessary to both track the spread of resistance and to design new tools to overcome resistance. Here, we show that the microbiome composition of insecticide resistant populations of <italic>An. gambiae, An. coluzzii</italic> and <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> originating in Burkina Faso from field caught populations and colonies across two countries show no changes in microbial composition compared to their susceptible counterparts. In contrast, <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> from Ethiopia demonstrates clear differences in microbiome composition in those dying and surviving insecticide exposure. To further understand resistance in this <italic>An. arabiensis</italic> population, we performed RNAseq and saw differential expression of detoxification genes associated with insecticide resistance and changes to respiration, metabolism and synapse-related ion channels. Taken together, these results indicate that in addition to changes to the transcriptome, the microbiome can contribute to insecticide resistance in certain settings.

N2  - Background: Occupational insecticidal poisoning (OIP) is a global phenomenon, which is even more prevalent among indoor residual spray-workers and this can pose a serious threat to their health. Objectives: This study aimed to assess spray-workers' management of insecticide risk indicators and occupational insecticidal poisoning. Materials and Methods: An analytical cross-sectional survey was adopted, that involved all of the professional indoor residual spray-workers serving in the Omo-Nada woreda (district), Ethiopia. The survey was conducted between January and April 2011 by administering a pre-tested questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS v.19.0. A two-sided Fisher's exact test was performed to determine associations between the variables. Results: Overall, 52.4% of the study participants had an awareness of the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), whereas 41.9% were unable to read the pesticide labels. About 75.3% of spray-workers never drink or eat or smoke, while spraying. Statistical analysis (two-sided Fisher's exact test) confirmed that there is no statistically significant association between safe insecticide practice with the spray-workerâs gender (P = 0.332), whereas, there were strong correlations found with age (P = 0.001), educational status (P = 0.001) and years of work experience (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Despite adequate awareness of safe insecticide management, most of the spray-workers were observed to be reluctant to put this knowledge into practice, either due to the inadequacy of PPE or negligence. Furthermore, a sizable faction of these workers still had limited knowledge and erroneous risk perceptions, thus increasing their risk of OIP. Therefore, appropriate communication strategies and training could reduce the occupational risk of insecticide exposure, which would ultimately minimize the related health hazards of insecticidal poisoning.

N2  - Background:-Malaria remains to be a major problem causing an unacceptable toll on the health and economic welfare of world’s poorest communities. Globally, it is agreed to reduce the burden of malaria by half by the year 2010 and again by half by 2015. Similarly, at the African summit on Roll Back Malaria (RBM) in Abuja, committed themselves to halving the burden of malaria by 2010, by achieving 60% coverage of all at risk population with suitable curative and preventive measures by 2005. Ethiopia, as one of the signatories of the Abuja convention, has included the above global strategies in its national malaria prevention and control approach. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess Insecticide Treated Nets utilization and associated factors among pregnant women in Halaba kulito town, 2016. Methods: A community based cross sectional study was carried out among pregnant women in Halaba Kulito town. The study included 92 mothers who were selected by simple random sampling. Household survey using structured questionnaire was used to collect information. Logistic regression analyses were employed to identify factors associated with ITN utilization. Variables with a p-value <0.05 were identified as statistically significant factors. Results: Only 51 (70.8%) of pregnant women had self-reported as utilizing bed net during in previous night of survey. The direct observation done had shown that only 39 (42.4%) of pregnant women were directly observed while sleeping under bed net. Among this 19 (20.43%) of pregnant women’s properly utilize mosquito net. Conclusion: The time taken to reach health institution, the type of bed room condition and level of education were some of significant factors which were associated with ITN Utilization. Majority of the pregnant women did not utilize ITN. Therefore, the free distribution should prioritize vulnerable groups using good opportunity of Antenatal care clinic, household education and regular district level on going survey.

N2  - Introduction: In malaria endemic areas, use of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) for protecting mosquito bite during sleeping is highly effective. Though ITN distribution has full coverage in Jawi District, northwest Ethiopia, the malaria transmission remains high. Hence, assessing the ITN utilization and associated factors are important for further interventions.Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate utilization of ITN and associated factors among households in Jawi-district, northwest Ethiopia.Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among households at Jawi District from February to March, 2016. A stratified simple random sampling technique was applied. Data were collected using pretested and structured questionnaire and observation check list easy used. A total of 410 households were included in the study. A Global Positioning System (GPS) was used to gather geographical data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with ITN utilization among respondents. An adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was computed to determine the level of significance.Result: The overall utilization of ITNs among households was 201(49.0%) (95% CI: 44.16, 53.9) with full coverage and possession of 2.4 individuals per ITN. Living in urban (AOR=3.0; 95% CI: 1.5, 6.0), having good knowledge (AOR=2.1; 95% CI: 1.1-4.0), two beds (AOR=2.4; 95%CI: 1.1-5.3) and being rich (AOR=2; 95% CI: 1.1-3.7) were predictors for ITN utilization. During dry season, ITN utilization among households reduced by 89% (AOR=0.11; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.17).Conclusion: In this study, ITN utilization and possession was below the Universal standard. The full coverage of ITN, awareness and having knowledge merely doesn’t guarantee ITN utilization. Hence, mobilizing households on sustained use of ITNs in order to optimize their role as a malaria control tool on rural and resettled villages in all seasons are supreme important.

N2  - Abstract Background: We reanalysed malaria incidence data from a malaria prevention study from the Rift Valley in Central Ethiopia (see https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12936-019-2775-1). Our objective was to investigate whether including an administrative structure within the society, which may have required consideration in our protocol or previous analysis, would provide divergent outcomes. Methods: We performed a cluster-randomised controlled trial lasting 121 weeks with 176 clusters in four groups with 6071 households with 34,548 persons: interventions combining indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), IRS alone, ITNs alone and routine use. The primary outcome was malaria incidence. A multilevel negative binomial regression model was employed to examine the impact of the kebele and the proximity of homes to the primary mosquito breeding sites as potential residual confounders (levels). The study also assessed whether these factors influenced the effect measures of the interventions. Results: The initial findings of our study revealed 1183 instances of malaria episodes among 1059 persons, with comparable effects observed across the four intervention groups. In the reanalysis, the results showed that both ITN+IRS (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.63, P&lt;0.001) and ITN alone (IRR 0.78, P=0.011) were associated with a greater reduction in malaria cases compared to IRS (IRR 0.90; P=0.28) or the control group (reference). The combined usage of IRS with ITN yields better outcomes compared to the standalone use of ITN and surpasses the effectiveness of IRS in isolation. Conclusion: The findings indicate that implementing a combination of IRS and ITN decreased malaria incidence. Furthermore, there was an observed synergistic impact when ITN and IRS were used in combination. Considering relevant social structures as potential residual confounders is of paramount importance.

N2  - Cercospora leaf spots caused by Cercospora arachidicola and Cercosporidium personatum are the most widespread diseases of groundnut that result in severe yield losses in Ethiopia. Field trials were conducted at Babile and Dire Dawa to evaluate the effect of integrated use of host resistance and fungicides on the temporal epidemics of leaf spots and yield of groundnut. The experiments were conducted during the 2010 main cropping season using three groundnut varieties and six fungicide treatments. The experiment was laid out as RCBD in a factorial arrangement with three replications. Severity, disease progress rate, area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) and yield of groundnut were used to evaluate the effects of treatments. High levels of disease control were achieved by weekly application of chlorothalonil at both locations. Up to 25 and 65% severity levels were recorded on sprayed and unsprayed plots of the varieties, respectively. Fungicide applications also significantly reduced disease progress rate and AUDPC value on the susceptible variety. Seed yield harvested from fungicide sprayed plots was consistently greater than the yield harvested from unsprayed plots. &nbsp; Key words: Arachis hypogaea L., Cercospora leaf spots, disease progress rate, disease severity and integrated disease management.

N2  - White rot (Sclerotium cepivorum Berk), is one of the most destructive soil borne pathogens that pose significant threat to production of garlic and other Allium species in Ethiopia and all over the world.Since most of the conventional control methods are not effective, the development of eco-friendly and cost effective integrated management method is critically required.A study was then conducted with completely randomized design and three replications that consist of all possible combinations of 31 treatments.The study was conducted during 2013/14 under greenhouse condition with the objective of evaluating the effect of two fungicides, Apron Star 42 WS and Tebuconazole, and in combination with four Trichoderma species namely T. hamatum, T. harzianum, T. oblongisporum and T. viride.The results of this study revealed that the efficacy of both fungicides, when tested alone, against S. cepivorum was lower than those treated with Trichoderma spp.alone and the fungicide combined treatments.Among all treatments, T16 (Apron Star 42 WS fungicide combined with T. hamatum and T. viride) has provided the best antagonistic activity against S. cepivorum with no disease incidence, followed by T. viride (T8) alone and Tebuconazole combined with T. hamtum (T21) (both 11.1% incidence).This was well correlated to the level of foliar, stem base and bulb rots symptoms as well as to plant growth and biomass of garlic plant parts.The results suggested that integration of fungicides and Trichoderma species is better than applying them alone, which could be attributed to the synergistic and additive growth promoting effects of combined treatments besides controlling the disease.This integrated approach appears to be the first report in Ethiopia, which has never been tested before.

N2  - Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the fourth major crop of the world after rice, wheat and maize. Potato is an important crop which holds promise for food to millions of people especially in developing countries. In Ethiopia, the yield per unit area of potato is very low compared to those of other countries. There are many factors that reduce the yield of the crop among which the diseases like late blight (Phytophthora infestans) and bacterial wilt (Ralstonia (Pseudomonas) solanacearum) which play an important role. Diseases such as late blight, early blight, fusarium wilt and black leg primarily affect the crop/foliage whereas diseases such as black scurf, wart, powdery scab and common scab disfigure the tubers and reduce their market value. Major fungal and bacterial diseases affecting potato crop are reviewed here with respect to their identification, symptoms on potato plants or tubers, nature of the pathogen involved, epidemiology, control measures <i>etc</i>. Management of these diseases is therefore very essential. Late blight of potato can be managed using the following management (control) strategies: use of biological control agents, use of resistant varieties, intercropping, use of certified disease-free seed, use of selective fungicides and cultural practices such as destruction of cull piles by freezing or deep burying, destruction of volunteer potato plants in nearby fields throughout the season, destruction (desiccate, disc or flail and desiccate) of infected plants to avoid spread, reduction of periods of leaf wetness and high humidity within the crop canopy by appropriately timing irrigation, application of a recommended fungicide spray program (the program should start prior to the arrival of the pathogen) and desiccation of vines prior to harvest.

N2  - Common bean production is severely infested by weeds in Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Field experiment was conducted to assess the integrated effect of different weed management practices and herbicides on the growth and yield of common bean in 2014 at Wolaita Sodo. The experiment comprises of fifteen treatments which included two herbicides (MET and PEN ) applied as pre-emergence alone and in different combinations, HWH, weedy check all with and without mulching and weed free check laid out in randomized block design with three replications. Weed community recorded included 55.6% broadleaved, 33.3% grass and 11.1% sedge. The density of broadleaved, grass and sedge was significantly influenced by weed management practices both at 2 and 12 weeks after crop emergence (WAE). At 2 WAE, application of PEN 1.0 kg ha -1 + mulching resulted in significant decrease in total weed density over weedy check. At 12 WAE PEN 1.0 kg ha -1 + HWH 5 WAE significantly reduced broadleaved and total weed densities over the other treatments, while in case of grass weed, it was statistically in parity with MET 0.50 kg ha -1 + PEN 0.75 kg ha -1 + mulching, HWH at 2 and 5 WAE and HWH at 2 WAE supplemented with mulching. Weed dry weight varied significantly in response to weed management practices at 2 WAE. However, at 12 WAE this has no significant difference with PEN 1.0 kg ha -1 + HWH 5 WAE, MET 0.75 kg ha -1 + PEN 0.75 kg ha -1 + mulching and HWH at 2 and 5 WAE. Herbicide mixtures and mulching did not alter weeds infestation to a considerable level. Application of PEN 1.0 kg ha 1 + HWH 5 WAE performed better than other herbicidal treatments in enhancing days to flowering and physiological maturity and increased yield attributing characters of common bean.

N2  - Amhara Regional State of Ethiopia has a population of approximately 19.6 million, is prone to unstable and epidemic malaria, and is severely affected by trachoma. An integrated malaria and trachoma control program is being implemented by the Regional Health Bureau. To provide baseline data, a survey was conducted during December 2006 to estimate malaria parasite prevalence, malaria indicators, prevalence of trachoma, and trachoma risk factors in households and people of all ages in each of the ten zones of the state, excluding three urban centers (0.4% of the population).The study was designed to provide prevalence estimates at zone and state levels. Using multi-stage cluster random sampling, 16 clusters of 25 households were randomly selected in each of the ten zones. Household heads were interviewed for malaria indicators and trachoma risk factors (N = 4,101). All people were examined for trachoma signs (N = 17,242), and those in even-numbered households provided blood films for malaria parasite detection (N = 7,745); both thick and thin blood films were read. Zonal malaria parasite prevalence ranged from 2.4% to 6.1%, with the overall state-wide prevalence being 4.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.8%-5.6%). The Plasmodium falciparum: Plasmodium vivax ratio ranged from 0.9-2.1 with an overall regional ratio of 1.2. A total of 14.8% of households reported indoor residual spraying in the past year, 34.7% had at least one mosquito net, and 16.1% had one or more long-lasting insecticidal net. Zonal trachoma prevalence (trachomatous inflammation follicular [WHO grade TF] in children aged 1-9 years) ranged from 12.6% to 60.1%, with the overall state-wide prevalence being 32.7% (95% CI: 29.2%-36.5%). State-wide prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) in persons aged over fifteen was 6.2% (95% CI: 5.3-7.4), and 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.5) in children aged 0-14 years. Overall, an estimated 643,904 persons (lower bound 419,274, upper bound 975,635) have TT and require immediate corrective surgery.The results provide extensive baseline data to guide planning, implementation, and evaluation of the integrated malaria and trachoma control program in Amhara. The success of the integrated survey is the first step towards demonstration that control of priority neglected tropical diseases can be integrated with one of the "big three" killer diseases.

N2  - Introduction Malaria and HIV are two of the most common and important health problems facing developing countries. It is estimated that over 40 million people are living with HIV globally [1] and there are 350–500 million clinical malaria episodes annually [2]. Even modest interactions between the two infections would have substantial public health implications in resource-constrained countries, especially in subSaharan Africa, where both infections are highly prevalent. Our current immunological knowledge suggests potential for a detrimental interaction in both directions. HIV infection impairs T-cell immunity, which is of crucial importance for antimalarial responses [3]. Therefore, in theory, HIV immunosuppression should increase the risk and severity of malarial infection. In addition, malaria infection activates T-cells, promoting HIV replication [4,5]. Since increased HIV RNA levels are associated with accelerated disease progression [6,7], malaria could potentially facilitate faster progression to AIDS and death [8]. Malaria–HIV interactions have been clearly demonstrated in young children, in whom malaria-induced anaemia leads to blood transfusions, which may transmit HIV [9–11]. Also, in pregnant women, HIV contributes to higher malaria infection rates, higher parasite density, more clinical illness, more anaemia, and diminished response to treatment [12–16]. Malaria infection also contributes to higher maternal HIV viral load, but whether this leads to increased mother-to-child HIV transmission is uncertain. Most studies have not found any evidence of an effect [12,17–21], although one study found a substantial increase in HIV transmission associated with malaria infection, and another with the rainy season when malaria infection rates are high [22,23]. This study reviews the evidence regarding HIV–malaria interactions in non-pregnant adults, for whom the likely overall public health impact is less clear. It focuses on how HIV alters the clinical presentation and outcome of malaria, what effect malaria may have on the natural history of HIV infection, and the implications of an interaction for surveillance systems, burden estimates and for the prediction of future trends. The implications of the interactions on policies for prevention and control of both diseases are considered as are priority areas for research. The data were obtained by searching PubMed for English publications using the keywords HIV, malaria, and adults; further information was obtained from abstracts of scientific meetings, the Internet and personal communications with scientists. Malaria in this review refers to infection with Plasmodium falciparum and HIV to HIV-1 unless otherwise specified. Effect of HIV on malaria The effect of HIV on malaria infection and clinical illness Early studies Early studies of the interaction between HIV and malaria were reviewed in 1992 [24] and again in 1998 [25]. Many of the studies available for those reviews had several features in common: they did not report CD4 cell counts and so did not distinguish between HIV infection and the associated immunodeficiency; and most were facility-based case–control or cross-sectional designs with limited ability to assess any longitudinal population-based impact of the two infections and their interaction [26]. Only one cohort study (involving both children and adults) had been published at the time [27], and this reported increased rates of non-severe malaria and significantly higher fever rates among HIV-seropositive individuals compared with seronegative individuals in Kinshasa. However, there were no significant differences in malaria slide positivity rate or parasite densities and the authors concluded that the higher rates of malaria were a consequence of ascertainment bias. Several other studies raised the prospect of an association between malaria and HIV. A cross-sectional study in rural Tanzania reported increased prevalence of parasitaemia, and non-significant increases in rates of non-severe malaria, among HIV-seropositive adults compared with those who were seronegative [28]. Hospital-based studies in Zambia and Burundi found increased malaria case fatality ratios in patients with HIV compared with HIV-seronegative individuals, but the small sample sizes did not allow firm conclusions to be drawn [29,30]. Overall, these early studies and reviews concluded that there was little evidence of substantial interactions between HIV and malaria in non-pregnant adults. In contrast to similar reviews of HIV and tuberculosis or other opportunistic infections, it was clear that malaria was not going to be a florid opportunistic infection affecting many HIV-infected adults soon after immunodeficiency developed. However, more subtle interactions and programmatic considerations were generally ignored and a period of relatively little scientific investigation on HIV–malaria interactions ensued. Recent studies Studies published since the late 1990s have begun to clarify the nature and scale of the interaction. The underlying epidemiology and intensity of malaria transmission and the duration of HIV infection and consequent immunosuppression appear to be critical in determining the consequences of coinfection. In areas of stable malaria, with intense continuous transmission, adults acquire substantial immunity against malaria through repeated infections in early life such that infection and clinical illness are uncommon. In contrast, young children who have not yet acquired malarial immunity and pregnant women, who transiently lose some of their acquired immunity, are at particular risk of malaria infection and its complications. In areas of unstable malaria, with intermittent unpredictable transmission, the entire population has little or no acquired immunity to malaria. While some HIV-infected individuals have a rapid course of immunosuppression and associated illnesses, most will develop gradual loss of immune responsiveness over a number of years. This leads to increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and evidence is accumulating that this includes increased vulnerability to malaria infections and their consequences. Table 1 summarizes the findings of 12 studies on the impact of HIV on malaria infection and illness. In areas of stable malaria transmission, malaria infection rates and the frequency of clinical illness (fever and other findings) appear to be increased in HIV-infected adults, particularly those with immunosuppression, as measured by low CD4 T cell counts. In Ugandan adults, the odds of parasitaemia, and risk of malarial fever increased with decreasing CD4 cell count, such that individuals with CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/μl were more than twice as likely to suffer malarial fever as individuals with > 500 cells/μl [31,32]. Similarly, a hospital-based case–control study in northern Uganda found an association between HIV infection and symptomatic malaria [33]. A recent study in a cohort of Malawian adults reported a moderate association between malaria parasitaemia and HIV infection. High parasite densities with fever were associated with low CD4 cell counts [34]. Another study of 660 adults in a holoendemic area in urban Malawi found increasing incidence of clinical malaria, and clinical malaria with significant parasitaemia, with decreasing CD4 cell counts and an inverse relationship between parasite density and CD4 cell count [35]. Put together, these studies suggest that HIV-associated immunosuppression interferes with parasite control and may cause some loss of the specific disease-protective immune response that protects parasitaemic persons from developing clinical illness.Table 1: Effect of HIV on malaria infection and disease in adults, by regions of stable and unstable malaria transmission.Table 1: (Continued)Severe or complicated malaria has not been a feature of reports from regions of stable transmission. This may be because those with a high degree of acquired immunity may be able to sustain sufficient antitoxic immunity to avoid severe disease despite HIV-associated immunosuppression [36]. However, in regions of unstable malaria transmission, HIV-infected adults suffering from malaria are at increased risk of complicated and severe malaria and of death. This is particularly alarming in the light of recent estimates that more than half of the world's malaria is in hypo- and mesoendemic areas [37], indicating huge numbers of adults at risk of severe malaria and coinfection in regions and cities with generalized HIV epidemics. Studies in South Africa reported a doubling, or more, of the risk of severe or complicated malaria, and a five-fold increased risk of death, among HIV-infected adults compared with those who were uninfected [38,39]. In a study in a rural hospital in Zimbabwe, HIV-infected adults were more likely than uninfected patients to develop malaria complications and were more than twice as likely to die [40]. In a hospital-based study in urban Burkina Faso, where HIV prevalence in adults is reported to be 5–6% [41,42], more than 30% of adults with severe malaria were infected with HIV [43]. However, the number of cases involved was small, and HIV testing was not performed on all patients with severe malaria. Outside Africa, reports include a small study in Mumbai where higher HIV prevalence was found among patients with severe malaria than in the general population [44], studies demonstrating coinfection with HIV and malaria in injecting drug users in Brazil and Vietnam, and outbreaks of malaria in injecting drug users in previously malaria-free regions owing to needle sharing [45,46]. Effect of HIV on diagnosis and treatment of malaria Generally, malaria is clinically indistinguishable from many other causes of fever in HIV-infected individuals [38,39,43,47]. In many regions, malaria is diagnosed simply on the basis of fever, and drugs are administered without confirmatory testing [48,49]. Consequently, malarial fever may be overestimated and inappropriately treated if diagnosed without blood film examination. A study in 10 Tanzanian hospitals found that only 46% of patients clinically diagnosed with severe malaria had a positive P. falciparum blood slide result, yet 95% were given quinine [50]. The overdiagnosis of malaria increases the potential for severe outcomes of other causes of fever when incorrect treatment is given [50]. Although rates of clinical malaria increase in HIV-infected adults, the much increased rates of fever as a consequence of HIV infection, and its associated complications, mean that the proportion of fever that is attributable to malaria decreases as immunosuppression progresses [32,35,51]. This reduces further the specificity of a diagnosis of malaria based on febrile symptoms alone. It can be predicted that responses to antimalarial therapy will be decreased in immunosuppressed individuals coinfected with HIV and malaria living in regions of stable transmission. This may be either because of increased susceptibility to malaria reinfection, or because of recrudescence of infection, since antimalarial therapy is most effective in individuals who already have some acquired immunity. Results of seven studies of response to antimalarial therapy in HIV-infected adults are summarized in Table 2. Early studies did not suggest any impact of HIV on success of therapy with quinine, chloroquine and sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine, which were highly effective in all who were treated [27,52]. A more recent body of evidence suggests treatment failure may be common in HIV-infected individuals. In Ethiopia, parasite and fever clearance times were prolonged in HIV-infected adults treated with artemisinin for uncomplicated malaria [53]. In Kenya, significantly lower rates of parasite clearance at 28 days post-treatment with sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine were noted in patients with CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/μl compared with HIV-uninfected adults [54]. In a randomized controlled trial of artemether–lumefantrine versus sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine for the treatment of uncomplicated adult malaria in Zambia, the frequency of malaria treatment failure, for either therapy increased significantly with advancing immunosuppression [55]. A study in Uganda concluded, on the basis of molecular genotyping, that the increased risk of clinical treatment failure was a result of new infections rather than recrudescence [56]. There are no reports of increased adverse events associated with antimalarial therapy in HIV-infected individuals.Table 2: Summary of studies recording response to antimalarial therapy in HIV-infected adults.Effect of HIV on transmission of malaria No direct evidence has been found to suggest that HIV alters malaria transmission. Investigators have speculated that because HIV infection increases parasitaemia and reduces the response to therapy, it will increase the reservoir of infection in the human population and hence increase transmission [8,57]. In an area with high HIV prevalence (30%), it has been estimated that 20% of malaria infection could be attributable to HIV, assuming gametocytaemia parallels asexual parasitaemia [31]. However, the relationship between asexual parasitaemia and gametocytaemia is not straightforward and the effect of HIV infection on gametocytes remains unclear. The use of sulphonamide preparations, sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine for antimalarial treatment and cotrimoxazole for opportunistic infection prophylaxis, has been shown to increase the production of gametocytes [58]. However, a recent study reports a 38% decline in malaria incidence in household members of HIV-infected persons taking regular cotrimoxazole prophylaxis [59]. Nonetheless there may be an advantage from using effective artemisin-based combination therapy, particularly by rapidly lowering the burden of asexual parasites and transmissible gametocytes [60,61]. Effect of HIV treatment and prophylaxis on malaria A recent study in Uganda in HIV-infected adults found a reduction in febrile parasitaemia of 76% [95% confidence interval (CI), 62–85) associated with cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, of 92% (CI, 83–96%) associated with cotrimoxazole and antiretroviral treatment (ART), and of 95% (CI, 92–97) when insecticide-treated bed nets were added to cotrimoxazole and ART. This study demonstrates that the effects of these three interventions are cumulative, and that malaria infection can be successfully controlled in HIV-infected adults [62]. Effect of malaria on HIV Effect of malaria infection on HIV viral load Upregulation of HIV viral transcription has been described for coinfection with several pathogens [63–66] and appears to be the case for malaria, as summarized in Table 3. Investigators in Malawi observed nearly a doubling of HIV viral load in 77 subjects following malarial infection and an increase of almost 1 log copies/ml in 13 with CD4 cell count > 300 cells/μl who fulfilled a stricter definition (fever and high parasite density) of clinical malaria [8]. This study confirmed earlier reports from both Malawi [57] and Uganda [67] of an acute rise in HIV viral load at the time of malaria infection. In each study, convalescent viral loads generally returned to preinfection levels following malaria treatment.Table 3: Effect of malaria on HIV infection in adults.By contrast, in one small study in rural Guinea-Bissau, mostly involving HIV-2-infected individuals, no increase in viral load was found in HIV-infected patients during the wet (malaria) season compared with the dry season [68]. Effect of malaria infection on HIV disease progression and treatment No direct evidence has been found to suggest that malaria alters HIV disease progression. Investigators have speculated that transient increases in HIV viral load associated with malaria could accelerate disease progression [8,57]. However, other reports have suggested minimal differences between untreated median survival time in developed (non-malarious) and developing (malarious) countries [69,70]. Evidence to implicate these transient increases in viral load as clinically important is scarce. Indeed, a report from a cohort of HIV-infected individuals and uninfected controls in rural Uganda concluded that there was no strong detrimental effect of malaria on all-cause mortality in HIV-seropositive adults [71] (Table 3). However, another study in Uganda found significantly faster CD4 cell declines in individuals following episodes of malaria [72]. Indirect evidence of a possible role for malaria prevention in limiting HIV disease progression comes from studies in Côte d'Ivoire, Uganda and Kenya examining the effect of daily cotrimoxazole as prophylaxis against opportunistic infections, which consistently reported better prognosis and reduced rates of malaria [73–75]. In one study, failure to treat undiagnosed fevers with antimalarial drugs was also associated with death [51]. Successful ART is expected to reduce the risk of serious opportunistic infections dramatically, and this appears to include clinical malaria [62]. Additionally there are documented in vitro effects of ART on malaria parasites [76,77]. It would be prudent to ensure that malaria surveillance is part of any broader monitoring of ART outcomes in areas where ART use is increasing and HIV and malaria coexist. The potential for interactions between antimalarial and antiretroviral drugs has recently been reviewed [78]. Effect of malaria infection on HIV transmission No direct evidence has been found to suggest that malaria alters HIV transmission in adults. High HIV viral loads have been shown to be associated with increased potential for HIV transmission [79,80], but there is no empiric evidence to implicate the transient increases in HIV viral load associated with malaria infection with increases in HIV transmission [81]. A primary concern is the transmission of HIV through injections and transfusions for the management of malarial fever or malaria-induced anaemia [9–11]. While this is a documented problem in young children in areas of high malaria transmission [9], malaria-induced anaemia requiring transfusion is much less common in adults and so may not constitute a major means of HIV transmission. HIV and malaria programme overlap Current prevention and control programmes for HIV and malaria are defined and separate from one another, despite having a number of common features and goals. There may be substantial overlap in risk population groups, with common infrastructure needs. Many control efforts utilize the same health personnel and sites for service delivery, often with common intervention tools, programme and resource mechanisms. The overlapping characteristics of these programmes are shown in Table 4. In areas where both infections are common, specific coordinated prevention and treatment measures for adults that would have immediate impact on both diseases include:Table 4: Common features of HIV and malaria programmes and infrastructure needs. strengthening diagnostics and syndromic treatment protocols [82] for both HIV and malaria so that expensive drugs can be directed to those in need encouraging all identified HIV-infected persons (and especially those under HIV care and treatment programmes) to sleep under an insecticide-treated bed net [62] and use other malaria-prevention measures (indoor residual spraying, other personal protection measures) as appropriate providing all HIV-infected persons with highly effective antimalarial drugs for the treatment of any malaria illness providing all symptomatic HIV-infected persons with cotrimoxazole as prophylaxis for opportunistic infections; this is also likely to prevent malaria infection [62,73–75] providing voluntary counselling and testing sites for persons with unknown HIV status at places where malaria interventions, such as free or highly subsidized insecticide-treated bed nets, might be distributed, thus serving as an incentive for many to attend including interventions for both infections for pregnant women, and anaemia prevention and safe use of blood products for young children [12], as part of a comprehensive strategy for the two diseases. Implications, summary and conclusions HIV and malaria coexist in regions with the most poorly developed health surveillance systems, making the public health scale of any interaction difficult to determine. In general, the national malaria estimates by the World Health Organization and the UNAIDS national HIV estimates are derived with much extrapolation from limited data and thus the estimates are imprecise [2,36,83–87]. Large sections of the populations of countries with generalized HIV epidemics (> 1% HIV prevalence in the general population) and a high malaria burden are at particular risk of coinfection. In low-level and concentrated HIV epidemics (< 1% HIV prevalence in the general population), specific population subgroups are likely to be most at risk of coinfection by virtue of their behaviour. For example, expanding HIV epidemics are being fuelled by injecting drug use and heroin trafficking in malaria-endemic areas in Asia and Latin America [88,89] and increasing incidence of coinfections are to be expected in the future. The two diseases have the greatest overlap in subSaharan Africa, where 70% of the global burden of P. falciparum infections [85] and 60% of HIV infections occur [1] in an area with only 12% of the world's population. However, HIV is predominantly a disease of sexually active adults, worse in urban environments and in southern Africa, while malaria is predominantly a disease of young children and pregnant women, with the greatest burden in rural areas and in west and eastern Africa [90]. This will reduce the actual infection overlap; indeed a recent modelling study estimated that the HIV-1 epidemic has increased the incidence of clinical malaria by only 1.3%, and malaria deaths by 4.9% in subSaharan Africa as a whole [91]. However, in regions of unstable malaria transmission, where adults are affected by both diseases, and especially in southern Africa, the HIV-attributable increase in clinical malaria incidence may rise up to 28%, and for malaria deaths up to 114%. However, more work is needed at subnational level to obtain an accurate estimate of the impact of each infection on the other. There is increasing clarity on the spectrum of interaction between HIV and malaria in non-pregnant adults (Table 5). The HIV–malaria biological interaction is apparently driven by substantial immune compromise, which contributes to more malaria infection, somewhat higher parasite density, more malaria clinical illness, and possibly a diminishing response to treatment when drugs may be starting to fail. More severe malaria disease and death are seen specifically among persons with little or no acquired immunity. The effect of malaria on HIV is less clear. Malaria contributes to transient HIV viral load increases, but these are reversible with effective therapy. Much remains to be discovered about the interaction between HIV and malaria, and some of the most important gaps in our knowledge are priorities for research:Table 5: Specific biological, clinical and transmission effects of HIV–malaria interactions. the effect of HIV infection on malarial infection and disease across the full range of malaria transmission settings the effect of HIV-associated immunosuppression on malaria transmission the clinical effect of acute malaria episodes on HIV prognosis and transmission interactions between HIV and non-falciparum plasmodium species details at subnational level of HIV and malaria distribution to identify geographical and age and sex group overlaps levels of antimalarial drug use in relation to HIV status the contribution of inaccurate malaria case definition and diagnosis to the overuse of drugs and clinical outcome the effects of ART and cotrimoxazole on malaria diagnosis, rates of clinical disease and the development of drug resistance in different settings interactions between antimalarial drugs, ART and cotrimoxazole the effect of intermittent presumptive treatment of malaria for HIV-infected individuals the impact on HIV infection of changing antimalarial drug regimens the contribution of HIV to overestimates of malaria-attributable mortality. The HIV–malaria programme interaction is extensive and driven by the common features of the clinical illnesses, the similar sites and health staff involved, and the similarity in services that must be provided, resourced and coordinated. Effective prevention and management of HIV and malaria, and indeed of tuberculosis, will jointly reduce their impact [62,92,93]. Malaria interventions are relatively inexpensive (insecticide-treated bed nets cost US$2.50–5.00 for quality products; antimalarial adult curative treatment doses are less than US$2.00) and have been shown to be highly cost effective [94]; this will be particularly true for the HIV-infected community. Collaboration in joint programming is often not achieved, but in this case and particularly for the benefit of the HIV-infected populations, joint advocacy and receptivity to combined service delivery will improve survival and the quality of many lives.

N2  - The study was conducted in three selected districts of central rift valley of Oromia, Ethiopia with the objective to assess and prioritize the reasons of honeybee colony mobility. For this study, six peasant associations (PAs) were selected using purposive sampling techniques. From each PA, 20 beekeepers (a total of 120) were randomly selected and interviewed using pre-tested, structured questionnaires. The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 software and descriptive statistics. Results of the study showed that the mean age of the respondents was 46.54 years, indicating an active and productive age. The beekeepers had an average experience of 5.76 years where male respondents (89.2%) take the largest share to be engaged in beekeeping activities. Ranking revealed that pests, predators and Diseases (17.6%), shortage of bee forage (15.8%), unwise application of agrochemicals (15%), honeybee colony absconding and migration (10%), shortage of bee colony (9.4%), high cost of honeybee equipments and accessories (8.1%), recurrent drought and deforestation (6.8%), shortage of water (4.6%), lack of knowledge (3.6%), poor extension services (2.7%), poor hive management (2.7%), inadequate of business support services (2.1%) and bee poisoning from plants (1.5%) the main constraints of beekeeping in the study area in their order of importance. The main causes of colony absconds and migration in the study area were pests and predators (21%), shortage of bee forage and water (20.6%), incessant disturbance or poor hive management (18.3%), unwise application of agrochemicals (13.9%), unfavorable weather condition (8.1%), in appropriate of honey harvesting techniques (3.97%) and unknown reasons (2.2%). The main month in which colony absconding occurs is from December to February. Beekeepers in the study area prevent the incidence of swarming by using large volume of hive (33%), suppering of hive (26%), removal of queen cells (19.7%), killing new emerged queen (11.7%) and swarming return back to the colony (10%). The study demonstrated that honey productions in the study area are hampered by several constraints and challenges. Therefore, large scale and comprehensive research on constraints and honeybee diseases are highly recommended to take in preventing colony mobility as identified in this study.

N2  - Water hyacinth is a free-floating aquatic plant native to the Amazon Basin in South America and the most dangerous and worst aquatic plant in the world including Ethiopia. The objective of the current study was to evaluate water hyacinth found in Lake Ziway for its suitability and safe as animal feed. Suitability of the water hyacinth was determined based on its nutrient content, while safety was determined based on the level of selected heavy metals, and pesticides. Three sites were selected for sampling purposively based on the types of land use and potential sources of water pollution around the Lake. Water hyacinth samples were collected from the selected sites and the level of selected heavy metals, 21 organochlorine, and 14 organophosphate pesticides were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrometry and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (gc-ms), respectively. The proximate analysis in the water hyacinth were also determined using the standard method of analysis. The results obtained demonstrate that the level of heavy metals found the ranged from nd to9.0 mg/Kg for cadmium; nd to 30.44 mg/Kg for chromium; 118.1 to 518.8 mg/Kg for manganese; 6.78 to 57 mg/Kg for copper; 34.28 to 884.19 mg/Kg for iron; 2.84 to 37.02 mg/Kg for nickel nd to 21mg/kg for lead and 25.67 to 89.9 mg/Kg for zinc. All pesticides levels were below the limits established by European council regulation for plants used as animal feed which is &lt;0.001mg/Kg. The proximate analysis of the water hyacinthsamples of the leaves parts was moisture content 9.32%, crude protein 18.03%, crude fat 1.42%, crude ash 17.04%, crude fiber 31.04% carbohydrate 22.30%and energy 174 Kcal. The result of the stem revealed the presence of 3.96 moisture content, 2.17% crude protein, 0.47% crude fat, 5.23% crude ash, 6.70% crude fiber, 81.47% carbohydrate, and 338.79 Kca energy. Based on the results of this study, water hyacinth in the Lake Ziway can be potentially used for animal feed.

N2  - Abstract Background Asymptomatic malaria transmission has become a public health concern across malaria-endemic Africa including Ethiopia. Specifically, Plasmodium vivax is more efficient at transmitting earlier in the infection and at lower densities than Plasmodium falciparum . Consequently, a greater proportion of individuals infected with P. vivax can transmit without detectable gametocytaemia. Mass treatment of livestock with macrocyclic lactones (MLs), e.g., ivermectin and doramectin, was suggested as a complementary malaria vector tool because of their insecticidal effects. However, the effects of MLs on P. vivax in Anopheles arabiensis has not yet been fully explored. Hence, comparative in-vitro susceptibility and ex-vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of ivermectin, doramectin and moxidectin sub-lethal concentrations on P. vivax oocyst development in An. arabiensis . Methods The 7-day sub-lethal concentrations of 25% (LC 25 ) and 5% (LC 5 ) were determined from in-vitro susceptibility tests on female An. arabiensis in Hemotek® membrane feeding assay. Next, an ex-vivo study was conducted using P. vivax gametocytes infected patient’s blood spiked with the LC 25 and LC 5 of the MLs. At 7-days post-feeding, each mosquito was dissected under a dissection stereo microscope, stained with 0.5% (w/v) mercurochrome solution, and examined for the presence of P. vivax oocysts. Statistical analysis was based on a generalized mixed model with binomially distributed error terms. Results A 7-day lethal concentration of 25% (LC 25 , in ng/mL) of 7.1 (95% CI: [6.3;8.0]), 20.0 (95%CI:[17.8;22.5]) and 794.3 (95%CI:[716.4;1516.3]) were obtained for ivermectin, doramectin and moxidectin, respectively. Similarly, a lethal concentration of 5% (LC 5 , in ng/mL) of 0.6 (95% CI: [0.5;0.7]), 1.8 (95% CI:[1.6;2.0]) and 53.7 (95% CI:[ 48.4;102.5]) were obtained respectively for ivermectin, doramectin and moxidectin. The oocyst prevalence in treatment and control groups did not differ significantly (p &gt; 0.05) from each other. Therefore, no direct effect of ML endectocides on P. vivax infection in An. arabiensis mosquitoes was observed at the sub-lethal concentration (LC25 and LC5). Conclusions The effects of ivermectin and doramectin on malaria parasite is more likely via indirect effects, particularly by reducing the vectors lifespan and causing mortality before completing the parasite’s sporogony cycle or reducing their vector capacity as it affects the locomotor activity of the mosquito.

N2  - Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) affect millions of people in developing countries mainly due to dietary iodine deficiency and aggravating factors that affect the bioavailability of iodine in the body. Iodine deficiency disorder is one of the public health problems of Ethiopia. Recent findings show that both endemic a nd non- endemic areas have high goiter rates . Burie and Womberma districts are two of the endemic goiter areas in the country. T he etiology of goiter in these areas is not fully studied so far. T he objective of this cross -sectional community based study was to assess the magnitude and causes of goiter . The study was conducted in July 2010. The sample size was determined by assuming 50% prevalence of total goiter rate, 5% error, 95% confidence interval, design effect of 1(random) and 5% of non- response rate. A two -stage random sampling (sub- district and village ) was used to select children age d 6- 12 years and their biological mother s from 10 randomly selected village s in each of the districts . Overall , 403 households participated in the study. The assessment was conducted using palpation of thyroid size, urinary iodine level determination , household level interview and Focus Group Discussion (FGD). The study revealed a total goiter prevalence rate of 54% and 30.1 % in children and their biological mother s, respectively . More than 64% of the children were severely iodine deficient. The major cause for goiter as revealed by urinary iodine level and concentration of iodized salt is dietary iodine deficiency. There are no goitrogenic foods such as cassava; however, goitrogenic chemicals such as Dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane ( DDT ) and 2,4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid ( 2,4- D) were widely use d. The study area s are known for surplus produce of cereals, legumes and chilli. In order to reverse the problem , immediate and sustainable distribution of iodated salt /oil capsule , prohibition of direct application of pesticides on foods and awareness creation on adverse effects of IDD and benefits of iodine nutrition is highly recommended.

N2  - Hemileia vastatrix – the coffee leaf rust (CLR) fungus – is native from Africa and an exotic invasive species in all other areas of the world where coffee is grown. It causes the worst disease of coffee, but in Africa, it is not regarded as the worst pathogen of the crop. Management of CLR has relied on escaping the disease through the highland plantation, using resistant coffee varieties and fungicide applications. There are limitations for each of these strategies and novel approaches for CRL management are necessary. It has been conjectured that natural enemies of H. vastatrix endemic to Africa might have been overlooked and that such antagonists might have the potential for CLR management. Surveys conducted since 2015 in Cameroon, Ethiopia and Kenya, have revealed numerous mycoparasitic fungi attacking CLR in the field as well as endophytic fungi growing inside healthy coffee plants (several of which were, or are being, described as new to science), which might play a bodyguard role, protecting the plants against the disease. Results of previous studies and of the present research seem to confirm this hypothesis. A series of taxonomic and polyphasic studies allowed to identify isolates of Aspergillus and Clonostachys as belonging to Aspergillus flavus, Clonostachys byssicola, C. rhizophaga and C. rosea f. rosea. All the selected endophytic isolates (confirmed here regardless of the genus, to grow as endophytes in coffee), including Trichoderma strains were demonstrated to inhibit the germination of H. vastatrix in vitro. The isolate of A. flavus was shown not to produce aflatoxin. Beforehand applications of a series of isolates, of Clonostachys, Trichoderma and also of A. flavus, on young C. arabica plants (a combination of soil and foliar applications) followed by inoculation with H. vastatrix led to the significant reductions in CLR severity. Two Clonostachys rhizophaga isolates (COAD 2981 and COAD 2982), and one C. rosea isolate (COAD 2984) yielded the best highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) results for reduction of CLR severity among the Clonostachys isolates. Trichoderma guizhouense (COAD 2398), T. virens (COAD 2400) and T. theobromicola (COAD 2406) also produced highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) levels of CLR severity reduction. This is the first study reporting anti-CLR biocontrol potential for African isolates of A.flavus, Clonostachys and Trichoderma. And, they may pave the way towards preventive treatment of coffee plants with ‘bodyguard’ endophytes antagonistic to H. vastatrix as well as their use for control of CLR in the field. A continuation of this work is required to better assess this possibility. Keywords: Classical biocontrol. Coffee rust. Endophytes. Phylogeny. Taxonomy.

N2  - Phenotypic and molecular methods were used to isolate and characterize B. thuringiensis from diverse agro-ecological zones of Ethiopia. Bioassays were used to test the insecticidal activity of B. thuringiensis strains against the major malaria vector, Anopheles arabiensis (Diptera). B. thuringiensis were isolated from 32% of the total 503 soil samples collected from the 16 agro-ecological zones. All sequenced isolates were 99%–100% identical to each other and to B. thuringiensis entries in Genbank. B. thuringiensis with similar 16S rRNA gene sequences from these different zones were characterized with regard to maximum growth rate and temperature optima for growth to test if there was local adaptation in these functional traits. The result showed a narrow temperature range around 30°C for maximal growth rate, and there were no significant differences between agro-ecological zones. Of 110 Bacillus thuringiensis isolates analyzed for the presence of crystal protein genes, 7 tested positive for cry 4, cry 11, and cyt toxin genes. Sequencing of these genes in positive strains demonstrated 99–100 % homology to known mosquitocidal cry and cyt genes in Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. The present study shows that this biotechnologically important species is wide spread in Ethiopian soils and that it does not demonstrate local adaptation to temperature regimes, at least not for basic functions such as growth-temperature response. Our finding also pointed the potential for exploiting this species in vector control programs.

N2  - Fall armyworm is one of the challenges in the agricultural sector. It is a major insect pest of maize and other crops. Currently, farmers use chemical insecticides to reduce such losses. However, chemical insecticides cause the development of insecticidal resistance in insects, environmental pollution, human health hazards, harm to non-target species, etc. Therefore, agrarian look for safe and effective alternative approaches, biological control to fall armyworm. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) based biopesticide is a major alternative to solve these problems. This study aimed to isolate and characterize local Bt isolates from soil and water samples of different sites in Amhara and Afar Region and laboratory testing of their insecticidal activity against fall armyworm. The data was analyzed using Analysis of Variance. A total of 18 soil and water samples were collected from study sites to isolate Bt variety. Morphological and biochemical methods were used to characterize and identify Bt isolates. Based on results, a total of 21 Bt isolates were recovered from102 bacillus species- Bt like a colony and the overall Bt index corresponding to the whole sampling areas was 0.2. From total isolates, 7 isolates had a high potential to kill FAW within 72 hrs. W3C and M8E isolate were best as compared to other potential isolates, including reference strains because they were killed after 48 hrs. To conclude Screening of soil and water samples from different sources and habitats may be useful to obtain potential Bt isolates with broader host ranges and high potential for insecticidal activity.

N2  - The awareness level of the farmers growing Khat regarding the safe use of pesticide was investigated in this study at Haromaya Wereda, Eastern Ethiopia. In order to achieve the proposed objectives, structured questionnaires, oral discussions, and field observations were organized with the farmers growing Khat on the safe use of pesticide. After the study sites were selected purposively, systematic random sampling of the target population was applied. The study result revealed that the farmers lack training on pesticide practices, and most of them use their own experience and consult their neighbours. The findings of the study further indicated that majority of the farmers do not believe that pesticides can be detected in the soil, fruit and leaves of tree, air, ground water and food. Nearly half of the farmers were aware of the harmful effects of using pesticide on insects and birds. The farmers have poor understanding of the effect of long term exposure to pesticides compared to short term exposure. The farmers' understanding of exposure to pesticides through respiratory system and mouth is relatively satisfactory compared to the dermal exposure. Over one third of the farmers had no knowledge of how to store pesticides in the right conditions. However, greater percentage strongly believes that pesticides should be kept out of the reach of children. Even though, majority of the respondents indicated that DDT was used on Khat, only few of them have knowledge of its illegal importation. The outcomes of the study confirmed the need of training on the safe use of pesticides to raise the awareness of the farmers and safeguard the health of the farmers and the environment. Key words: Knowledge, attitude, pesticide, environmental, health, Khat growing farmers, Haromaya, Ethiopia.

N2  - Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are a key malaria control intervention. Although LLINs are presumed to be effective for 3 years under field or programmatic conditions, net care and repair approaches by users influence the physical and chemical durability. Understanding how knowledge, perception and practices influence net care and repair practices could guide the development of targeted behavioural change communication interventions related to net care and repair in Ethiopia and elsewhere.This population-based, household survey was conducted in four regions of Ethiopia [Amhara, Oromia, Tigray, Southern Nations Nationalities Peoples Region (SNNPR)] in June 2015. A total of 1839 households were selected using multi-stage sampling procedures. The household respondents were the heads of households. A questionnaire was administered and the data were captured electronically. STATA software version 12 was used to analyse the data. Survey commands were used to account for the multi-stage sampling approach. Household descriptive statistics related to characteristics and levels of knowledge and perception on net care and repair are presented. Ordinal logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with net care and repair perceptions.Less than a quarter of the respondents (22.3%: 95% CI 20.4-24.3%) reported adequate knowledge of net care and repair; 24.6% (95% CI 22.7-26.5%) of the respondents reported receiving information on net care and repair in the previous 6 months. Thirty-five per cent of the respondents (35.1%: 95% CI 32.9-37.4%) reported positive perceptions towards net care and repair. Respondents with adequate knowledge on net care and repair (AOR 1.58: 95% CI 1.2-2.02), and those who discussed net care and repair with their family (AOR 1.47: 95% CI 1.14-1.89) had higher odds of having positive perceptions towards net care and repair.The low level of reported knowledge on net care and repair, as well as the low level of reported positive perception towards net repair need to be addressed. Targeted behavioural change communication campaigns could be used to target specific groups; increased net care and repair would lead to longer lasting nets.

N2  - Background: Poor or lack of insecticide treated net (ITN) use as malaria preventive behaviour is one of the obstacles for the success of malaria prevention and control program. Therefore, Current information on insecticide treated net use as malaria preventive behaviour and its predictors are vital for malaria prevention and control program. Objective: To identify determinants of insecticide treated net use as malaria preventive behaviour among households in Maji district, Bench Maji Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. Methodology: Community based cross-sectional quantitative study supplemented by qualitative study was conducted from March ¬15 to 30/2015 in Maji district, Bench Maji Zone of South Nation and Nationality People Regional State (SNNPR). A total of 770 selected household heads were involved in the study. Data was collected through face to face interview technique by trained data collectors. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 statistical package. Multiple logistic regressions analysis was used to identify the independent predictors of insecticide treated net use as malaria preventive behaviour. Odds ratio, with 95% confidence level and P<0.05 were used to determine statistically significant association. Result: A total of 770 (91%) participants were actually involved in the study. Of the total study participants, 76.5% were males and 23.5% were females. Forty point eight percent, 40.8% of study participants were ITN users in night before data collection. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that ITN use had association with ever had malaria: OR=5.94 (0.545-0.64), Perceived susceptibility to malaria: OR=3.47 (1.92-6.26), perceived benefit of using ITN: OR=1.06 (1.02-1.106) and knowledge on malaria: OR 3.25(1.6-6.2). Conclusion and recommendation: This study had revealed that ITN use was low in Maji district. Existing efforts should be revised specifically for its effect on individual perception of ITN use. The research calls for the need to strength the health education and behaviour change activities.

N2  - Abstract Background: The insecure utilization and misapplication of pesticides in Ethiopia are major fears to farmers' wellbeing and the ecosystem. This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practices of the small-scale vegetable farmers towards the use of pesticides in Ethiopia along the littoral of Lake Ziway. Methods: It was a cross-sectional study involving a total of 210 farmers randomly selected during pesticide application from a purposively selected irrigation-using village located in the immediate vicinity of Lake Ziway. Data were generated through structured in-depth interviews and observations on-farms. A chi-square test was applied to evaluate whether the collected data and their probable association were significant. Results: The results show that WHO class II pesticides (moderately toxic) are the most frequently used pesticides in the study area. The use of WHO classes 1a and 1b and banned or restricted pesticides such as DDT and Endosulfan were not reported. A great portion (92%) of farmers indiscriminately disposed of empty containers in the field while 86.7% apply the leftover pesticides to other crops. More than 90% of small-scale farmers did not use any personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling pesticides. About 95% of farmers had poor knowledge regarding pesticides. A significant association (p &lt; 0.001) was observed between the knowledge of the farmers and their practices related to the pesticide. Conclusion : Generally, the Knowledge of small-scale farmers on pesticides was poor. Moreover inappropriate disposal of pesticides and its container will damage the environment. The finding of the study underlines the need to train framers concerning the safe and proper use of pesticides to prevent health and environmental hazards.

N2  - Optimal use of long-lasting insecticidal (LLINs) for malaria prevention depends on mass distribution, the users' perception and behaviour of local malaria vectors. This study was aimed at assessing knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of communities about LLINs and fabric integrities and insecticidal activities of nets under use in Wolaita zone, Sothern Ethiopia. Semi-structured interview questionnaires were used to collect data on KAP variables and WHO cone bioassay was used to test the insecticidal activity of sampled nets against an insectary colony of Anopheles arabiensis. Holes and repairs on surfaces of sample nets were counted and categorized following WHO guidelines to assess their fabric integrities. Chi-square (χ2) tests were used to verify associations between the demographic profiles of the respondents and their responses to KAP questionnaires. Out of a total of 770 household heads interviewed, 323 (42 %) and 447 (58 %) were males and females, respectively. The average family size in the surveyed households was 5.25 (±0.70 SE, range 1–12). The majority (81.1 %) of the households owned at least one LLIN. The average numbers of LLINs being used and sleeping places in the households were 1.61 (0.04 SE, range 0–4) and 2.27(0.03 SE, range 1–6), respectively. Most of the respondents (n = 687; 89.2 %) believed LLINs prevent malaria by killing or acting as physical barriers against mosquitoes. About 21 and 14 % of the respondents considered children under five years and pregnant women as priority groups for sleeping under LLINs. Households use LLINs consistently throughout the year (86.4 %) and tuck nets into bedding materials while sleeping (90.1 %). Physical inspection of fabric integrity of sampled LLINs revealed holes ranging from size 1 (0.5–2 cm) to size 4 (> 25 cm) mostly on lower ("right/left") surfaces. Moreover, most surfaces of sampled LLINs caused 100 % knockdown and mortality on insectary colonies of Anopheles arabiensis. The overall knowledge, attitude and practice about LLINs were satisfactory in the study areas. However, the family size net ratio must be narrowed and attention needs to be given to malaria vulnerable groups (children < 5 years of age and pregnant women). Continuous monitoring and evaluation of use and durability (fabric integrity and insecticidal activity) of LLINs should be conducted to avoid misuse and associated attrition of nets before the intended period.

N2  - We report the efficacy of a commercial formulation of the insecticide spinosad against larvae of Anopheles stephensi populations found in the city of Jigjiga, Somali Region, eastern Ethiopia. Batches of 25 larvae (late III to early IV instars) collected from large water storage reservoirs associated with construction sites (the primary An. stephensi larval site in the dry season) were tested under laboratory conditions against each insecticide at a dose recommended by the manufacturer (Natular® G30, 0.02 g/5 liter), following World Health Organization guidelines. Mortality at 24-48 h postexposure was 100%. Results show that spinosad is effective against An. stephensi larvae and suggest that it may be a useful tool as part of larval source management plans aimed at controlling this invasive malaria vector in Ethiopia.

N2  - Bedbugs are hematophagous insects that have plagued humans for over centuries.In recent decades bedbug infestation raising dramatically worldwide because of the emergence of insecticide resistance, notably pyrethroids.Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the insecticidal properties of Ethiopian indigenous plant Endod [vernacular name (local native language, Amharic); Phytolacca dodecandra L'Hérit] leaf extracts against bedbugs, under the laboratory conditions.Insecticidal bio-assay was performed against bedbugs.Both fresh (crude) and dried (acetone) leaves extracts of endod were impregnated to filter paper disc [(Whatman No. 1, 90mm); cut to 2.27cm 2 (1.7cm diam)] at various concentrations.Bedbugs were exposed for 2 h, subsequently transferred to an untreated environment and monitored for mortality at 24, 48 and 78 h intervals.Extracts of P. dodecantra exhibited various degrees of insecticidal activity against bedbugs.However, acetone extract has demonstrated quite remarkable insecticidal effects against bedbugs in terms of the higher mortality rate than the crude extract.The LC 50 , LC 90 and LC 99 values of the crude extract were at 24 h (3.986, 17.373 and 57.680 mg/l), 48 h (3.127, 14.576, and 51.126 mg/l), and 72 h (2.960, 14.202 and 50.91 mg/l) post exposure.Whereas LC 50 , LC 90 and LC 99 values of the acetone extract were at 24 h (3.127, 14.576 and 51.126 mg/l), 48 h (2.790, 13.730, and 50.327 mg/l) and 72 h (2.586, 10.464 and 32.703 mg/l) post treatment.The findings are clearly exhibited that the percent of mortality directly proportional to concentration as well as the period of exposure dependent.Green insecticides are often preferable because of their low mammalian and non-target toxicity.The findings clearly established the bio-potency of Endod as a safe alternative bedbug control agent.Nevertheless, further scientific studies are warranted to identify responsible bio-active molecules, their mode of action, safety to the human, non-target organism and environment.Besides, adequate measures have to be made by bringing various pertinent stakeholders in order to formulate and commercialize the endodbased insecticide to effectively combat bedbugs in the future.

N2  - Objectives and methods Quality laboratory services are a requisite to guide rational case management of malaria. Using a pre-tested, standardized assessment tool, we assessed laboratory diagnostic capacity in 69 primary, secondary and tertiary health facilities as well as specialized laboratories in five administrative zones in Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia, during February and March 2009. Results There was marked variability in laboratory diagnostic capacity among the facilities assessed. Of 69 facilities surveyed, 53 provided both comprehensive malaria laboratory diagnosis and outpatient treatment services, five provided malaria microscopy services (referring elsewhere for treatment), and 11 primary care health posts provided rapid diagnostic testing and outpatient malaria treatment. The facilities' median catchment population was 39 562 and 3581 people for secondary/tertiary and primary health facilities, respectively. Depending on facility type, facilities provided services 24 h a day, had inpatient capacity, and access to water and electricity. Facilities were staffed by general practitioners, health officers, nurses or health extension workers. Of the 58 facilities providing laboratory services, 24% of the 159 laboratory staff had received malaria microscopy training in the year prior to this survey, and 72% of the facilities had at least one functional electric binocular microscope. Facilities had variable levels of equipment, materials and biosafety procedures necessary for laboratory diagnosis of malaria. The mean monthly number of malaria blood films processed at secondary/tertiary facilities was 225, with a mean monthly 56 confirmed parasitologically. In primary facilities, the mean monthly number of clinical malaria cases seen was 75, of which 57 were tested by rapid diagnostic test (RDTs). None of the surveyed laboratory facilities had formal quality assurance/quality control protocols for either microscopy or RDTs. Conclusions This is the first published report on malaria diagnostic capacity in Ethiopia. While our assessment indicated that malaria laboratory diagnosis was available in most facilities surveyed, we observed significant gaps in laboratory services which could significantly impact quality and accessibility of malaria diagnosis, including laboratory infrastructure, equipment, laboratory supplies and human resources. Objectifs et méthodes: Des services de laboratoire de qualité sont une condition nécessaire pour guider la gestion rationnelle des cas de malaria. En utilisant un outil d'évaluation standardisé pré testé, nous avons évalué la capacité de diagnostic des laboratoires dans 69 établissements de santé primaires, secondaires et tertiaires ainsi que des laboratoires spécialisés, dans cinq zones administratives de l'Etat Régional d'Oromia en Ethiopie, en février et mars 2009. Résultats: Il y avait une variabilité marquée dans la capacité de diagnostic des laboratoires entre les établissements évalués. Sur les 69 établissements étudiés, 53 effectuaient à la fois le diagnostic de laboratoire complet de la malaria et des services de traitement ambulatoire, 5 fournissaient des services de microscopie de la malaria (et référaient ailleurs pour le traitement) et 11 postes de soins de santé primaire fournissaient un diagnostic par test rapide et un traitement de la malaria en ambulatoire. Les établissements couvraient des zones médianes de 39.562 et 3.581 personnes pour les établissements de santé secondaire/tertiaire et primaire, respectivement. Selon le type d'établissement, des services de 24 heures par jour, une capacité d'hospitalisation et l'accès à l'eau et l'électricitéétaient disponibles. Les établissements étaient desservis par des médecins généralistes, des agents de santé, des infirmiers ou des agents sanitaires. Sur les 58 établissements offrant des services de laboratoire, 24% (n = 159) du personnel de laboratoire avaient reçu une formation sur la microscopie de la malaria au cours de l'année précédant l'enquête et 72% des établissements avaient au moins un microscope binoculaire électrique fonctionnel. Les établissements avaient des niveaux variables de matériel d'équipement et des procédures de biosécurité nécessaires pour le diagnostic en laboratoire de la malaria. Le nombre moyen mensuel de frottis de sang examinés pour la malaria dans les établissements secondaires/tertiaires était de 225, avec une moyenne mensuelle de 56 confirmés parasitologiquement. Dans les établissements primaires, le nombre mensuel moyen de cas de malaria clinique vus était de 75, dont 57 ont été testés par le test de diagnostic rapide (TDR). Aucun des établissements de laboratoire surveillés n'avaient en place une assurance qualité officielle ou des protocoles de contrôle de qualité ni pour la microscopie ni pour le TDR. Conclusions: Il s'agit ici du premier rapport publié sur la capacité de diagnostic de la malaria en Ethiopie. Bien que notre évaluation indique que le diagnostic de laboratoire de la malaria est disponible dans la plupart des établissements surveillés, nous avons observé des lacunes importantes dans les services de laboratoire qui pourraient considérablement affecter la qualité et l'accessibilité au diagnostic de la malaria, comprenant l'infrastructure des laboratoires, l'équipement, les fournitures de laboratoire et les ressources humaines. Mots-clés: malaria, laboratoire, diagnostic, systèmes de santé, capacité, Ethiopie. Objetivos y métodos: Los servicios de laboratorio de calidad son un requisito a la hora de guiar el manejo racional de los casos de malaria. Utilizando una herramienta estandarizada de evaluación, previamente probada, evaluamos la capacidad diagnóstica de 69 centros sanitarios primarios, secundarios, y terciarios así como laboratorios especializados en cinco zonas administrativas en el Estado Regional de Oromia, Etiopía, durante Febrero y Marzo del 2009. Resultados: Existía una marcada variabilidad en la capacidad diagnóstica de los laboratorios de los diferentes centros evaluados. De 69 centros estudiados, 53 tenían tanto un diagnóstico integral de malaria a nivel de laboratorio como servicios de tratamiento en consultas externas, 5 tenían servicios de microscopía para malaria (refiriendo el tratamiento a otros centros), y 11 centros de atención primaria proveían pruebas diagnósticas rápidas y tratamiento para malaria en consultas externas. La media del área captación de los centros era de 39,562 y 3,581 personas para centros secundarios y terciarios y centros primarios respectivamente. Dependiendo del tipo de centro, se ofrecían servicios 24hrs al día, había posibilidad de ingresar pacientes y acceso a agua corriente y electricidad. Los centros estaban atendidos por médicos generales, enfermeras, responsables sanitarios o agentes de extensión sanitaria. De los 58 centros que proveían servicios de laboratorio, 24% de los 159 empleados de laboratorio habían recibido entrenamiento en microscopía de malaria durante el año anterior al estudio, y 72% de los centros tenían al menos un microscopio binocular eléctrico funcional. Los centros tenían niveles variables de equipamiento, materiales y procedimientos de bioseguridad necesarios para el diagnóstico de malaria en el laboratorio. La media mensual de láminas para malaria procesadas en centros secundarios/terciarios era de 225, con una media mensual de 56 confirmaciones parasitológicas. En centros primarios, la media mensual de casos clínicos de malaria era de 75, de los cuales se les realizó una prueba diagnóstica rápida (PDR) a 57. Ninguno de los centros con laboratorio evaluados tenían protocolos formales de garantía / control de para la microscopía o las PDRs. Conclusiones: Esta es la primera publicación sobre la capacidad de diagnóstico de la malaria en Etiopía. Mientras que nuestra evaluación indica que el diagnóstico de la malaria en laboratorio estaba disponible en la mayoría de los centros evaluados, hemos observado vacíos significativos en los servicios de laboratorio, que podrían impactar de forma significativa sobre la calidad y la accesibilidad del diagnóstico de la malaria, incluyendo la infraestructura de laboratorio, equipos, material de laboratorio y recursos humanos. Palabras clave: Malaria, laboratorio, diagnóstico, sistemas sanitarios, capacidad, Etiopía. Malaria is the most frequent cause of outpatient visits, health facility admissions and inpatient deaths in Ethiopia, accounting for 12% of outpatient visits and 10% of admissions in 2007/2008 (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Ministry of Health 2008). Rainfall and altitude are the major determinants of malaria epidemiology in the country (Ghebreyesus et al. 2000; Adhanom et al. 2006). Transmission occurs throughout the year in most locations with two distinctive peaks after the short and long rainy seasons in March–May and July–September, respectively (Graves et al. 2009; Peterson et al. 2009). Widespread and large-magnitude epidemics occur every 5–8 years (Negash et al. 2005; Guthmann et al. 2007). In Ethiopia, health services are provided through a four-tiered system comprising specialized referral hospitals, zonal hospitals, district hospitals and primary health care units (PHCUs), with average catchment populations of about 5 000 000, 1 000 000, 250 000 and 25 000 people, respectively. PHCUs consist of district health centres and community-level health posts. The latter focus on preventive services, providing only limited curative services. In 2007, for a total population of 77 million people, there were 143 hospitals [88 and 55 of which were administered by the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) and private sector/non-governmental organizations (NGOs), respectively]; 690 health centres (671 FMOH and 15 private sector/NGOs); 1376 health stations; and 9914 health posts. Hospitals and health centres are primarily concentrated in urban areas, whereas health posts are usually situated in rural areas. Hospitals have several cadres of health workers, including physicians (training: 6–7 years), nurses (2–3 years), laboratory technicians (2 years) and technologists (4 years). Health centres are usually staffed by at least one health officer or nurse, laboratory technicians, pharmacists or druggists, and midwives. Health posts are staffed by two female health extension workers (HEWs), i.e. high school graduates with 1-year training on a package of 16 health interventions, including malaria. Most patients with uncomplicated malaria are evaluated and treated at health post and health centre levels. The latter usually has laboratory services providing microscopic examination of blood films, whereas the former relies on malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Depending on aeti-ology, malaria cases are treated with the artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), for Plasmodium falciparum or chloroquine (CQ) for Plasmodium vivax according to national malaria case management guidelines (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Ministry of Health 2004). Because health centres have inpatient capabilities (albeit limited), they are the first referral point for the health posts for severe malaria cases. Most patients with severe malaria are managed by district and zonal hospitals, where they typically receive systemic quinine therapy. The country's laboratory services are supported by the Ethiopian Health, Nutrition and Research Institute (EHNRI) through a network of twelve regional reference laboratories (RRLs); currently, the support given is basic and focuses mainly on HIV and tuberculosis, and does not include malaria. EHNRI and its satellite RRLs have a broad mandate ranging from national infectious disease surveillance to public health emergency medicine and, as national reference laboratory, ensuring laboratory services quality control (QC) (EHNRI 2009). Two large grants from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria [Round 2 (2002–2008) total budget: $73 million and Round 5 (2005–2010) total budget: $140 million], provided funding for Ethiopia to dramatically scale-up malaria prevention and control interventions (Jima & Medhin 2008). This scale-up included the distribution of 12.5 million RDTs and 15.4 million ACT treatment doses to health facilities to increase access and availability of timely malaria diagnosis and effective treatment services (Jima et al. 2010). The initial scale-up of malaria prevention and control efforts in Ethiopia largely focused on the procurement of and access to key malaria commodities, rather than strengthening the support systems (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Ministry of Health 2006). Currently, no data exist on the reliability of laboratory confirmation of malaria diagnosis in Ethiopia, despite ongoing efforts to strengthen the laboratory quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) systems. Health workers have variable training in malaria laboratory diagnosis and experience shortages of equipment and supplies that may compromise effective malaria diagnostic and treatment services. Oromia Regional State is the largest of the 11 regional states of Ethiopia, with a population of 27 million people and covering about one-third of the country's landmass. Because of its malaria burden, Oromia has been the focus state for the US President's Malaria Initiative (PMI; http://www.pmi.gov). The aim of the survey reported here was to (i) comprehensively assess the capacity of selected health facilities within five zones in Oromia, Ethiopia, to perform malaria laboratory diagnosis and (ii) identify laboratory requirements to develop operational programme activities to support quality malaria case management for patients evaluated at these health facilities. Between February and March 2009, we assessed 69 health facilities within five administrative zones of Oromia, namely Arsi, East Shoa, Jimma, West Arsi and West Hararge (Figure 1). The surveyed facilities included seven hospitals, 45 health centres, three malaria control centres (MCCs), three RRLs and 11 health posts. This representative sample of health facilities was selected following discussions with the Oromia Regional Health Bureau (ORHB) and EHNRI. Location and distribution of health facilities surveyed in Oromia Regional State. We collected facility-based data, using a pre-tested, standardized, structured questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed: (i) general information about the facilities; (ii) information on type of malaria laboratory services, including availability of human resources, essential laboratory and clinical equipment and supplies, QA protocols for malaria laboratory diagnostics, status of biosafety and implementation; and (iii) laboratory data from different health facility registers. Four assessment teams comprising members of the International Center for AIDS Care and Treatment Programs – Columbia University (ICAP-CU), ORHB, the EHNRI, and Oromia RRL, together with Zonal and District Health Office malaria focal persons conducted the assessments. Prior to the survey, the assessment teams received 1 day of orientation on the survey tools and procedures. The survey approach included key informant interviews with facility-based health professionals, direct observation and review of secondary data. The data were entered, tabulated and analysed in spss Version 15 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Seven hospitals, 45 health centers (HCs) and one MCC provided comprehensive malaria case management and were classified as 'clinical referral centres'. The three RRLs provided laboratory services for QA/QC purposes only, and two MCCs provided laboratory services but referred patients to nearby HCs or hospital clinics for malaria treatment after laboratory diagnosis by microscopy. The 11 primary care health posts are typically in rural settings often without electricity, and these provide malaria treatment based upon RDT test results. Thus, the data below are presented as clinical referral centres (n = 53), laboratories (n = 58) and health posts (n = 11). The median catchment population of the 53 clinical referral centres was 39 562 people (range: 14 875–2 000 000). Hours of operation were 24 h a day in 46 (87%) of the surveyed facilities and 8 h a day for 5 days a week in the remaining 7. The median number of inpatient beds was six (range 0–400). Laboratory hours of operation were 24 h a day in 29 (50%) of the 58 surveyed facilities with microscopy laboratory; the remaining laboratories were open for 8 h a day/5 days a week. Electricity was available in 50 (86%) facilities, although 48 (96%) of these reported frequent power interruptions, with 30 (63%) reporting interruptions at least two times per week. Of facilities with access to electricity, 16 (32%) had a functional back-up generator. Of surveyed laboratories, 46 (79%) had ready access to water, with 41 and 5 using tap and well water, respectively. All the facilities reported having a disposal system, using either an incinerator (78%), pit burial (28%) or open field (7%) (Figure 2). Disposal systems at surveyed facilities: (a) incinerator at health centre; (b) pit disposal system at assessed laboratory; (c) waste disposal system at one of the assessed health posts; (d) waste storage at one of the assessed laboratories. Health posts surveyed provided clinical services to a median 3581 people (range: 1608–41 567), but do not provide microscopy laboratory services. Hours of operation of health posts were 8 h a day/5 days a week; six (55%) had water access, with four and two using well and pond water, respectively. All had a disposal system, with 10 using pit burial. Of the 53 clinical referral service facilities, 6 (11%), 4 (6%), 42 (79%) and 53 (100%) had general practitioners, medical specialists, health officers and nurses, respectively. Clinical manuals, reference books and guidelines for malaria were available in 32 (60%) of surveyed malaria clinics. In four (7%) facilities, health workers had attended training in RDTs in the past year. A total 159 laboratory staff worked at the 58 microscopy laboratories (mean: 3; range 1–21). All facilities had at least one laboratory professional, with 38 (66%) having at least one laboratory technologist (BSc-level undergraduate training) and 47 (81%) having at least one laboratory technician (diploma-level undergraduate training). Only one laboratory, the RRL in Adama, East Shoa Zone, had laboratory professionals with postgraduate-level training (n = 3). Laboratory cleaners were available in 52 (89%) of the surveyed facilities. Laboratory staff reported refresher training within the past year for malaria microscopy or RDT diagnosis at 14 (24%) and 2 (3%) of facilities, averaging 5.5 and 5 days duration, respectively; training was provided by the ORHB in collaboration with partner NGOs. Staffing at the 11 health posts consisted of two HEW's (n = 8), one HEW (n = 2) and one nurse (n = 1); at each, at least one of these health workers had refresher RDT training within 1 year. Of the surveyed facilities, 46 (79%) had at least one electric binocular microscope and 24 (41%) had 1 daylight binocular microscope; of these, 42 (91%) and 20 (83%) were functional, respectively (Table 1). Among facilities having binocular microscopes, 14 (20%) reported having spare microscope bulbs. We observed slide staining and drying racks in 33 (57%) and 37 (64%) facilities, respectively. Other major and minor laboratory equipment surveyed is summarized in Table 1. As health posts do not provide laboratory services, equipment and supplies are limited to diagnosing malaria cases with RDTs (Table 1). Of the surveyed facilities with laboratory services, 16 (28%) and 13 (22%) reported problems maintaining supplies of Giemsa stain and microscope slides, respectively. Reportedly, the Adama and Jima RRLs and the Adama Malaria Control Center that prepare Giemsa stock solutions had problems maintaining adequate supplies and quality of Na2HPO4 and KH2OPPO4 buffers (necessary to prepare Giemsa) and pH paper. The survey indicated problems with the supply of lancets, immersion oil, lens tissue, lead/grease pencils, alcohol and bleach in 7 (12%), 14 (24%), 45 (78%), 48 (83%), 27 (47%), and 26 (67%) facilities, respectively. During power interruptions, 13 (22%) facilities reported having the capacity to use alternative methods of temperature-controlled storage of consumables, either ice packs (85%) or kerosene refrigerators (15%). We observed labels on laboratory reagent containers in 39 (67%) of these facilities, but clearly recorded laboratory reagent expiry dates in only five (13%) of these facilities. Staff were trained in equipment maintenance in two (3%) of these facilities, and laboratory staff were trained to re-order laboratory consumables (e.g. supply chain management training) in four (7%) of these facilities. None of the facilities surveyed had service contracts with vendors for equipment maintenance. All of the health posts surveyed had the single-species Paracheck® RDT (Orchid Biomedical Systems, Goa, India) capable of detecting P. falciparum, stored at a mean room temperature of 27.2 °C (range 23.0–32.0) at the time of the assessment. In six (54.5%) of the health posts, the RDTs had expired, with the mean number of expired boxes (note, one box contains 25 RDTs) being 22. None of the HEWs reported being trained in supply management. We observed laboratory staff wearing protective coats in 46 (82%) laboratory facilities; a further 5 (9%) had protective coats available but did not use them, and 4 (7%) facilities did not have protective coats. We observed use of protective gloves in 29 (50%) laboratory facilities; at 9 (16%) staff did not use available gloves and at 18 (32%) staff did not have gloves. Hand-washing facilities were available for staff in 27 (48%) laboratory facilities surveyed. We observed use of disinfectants and antiseptics in 36 (63%) and 32 (56%) facilities, respectively. Of surveyed laboratory facilities, 46 (84%) were using household waste bins for storing contaminated non-sharp wastes (e.g. used plastic ware, gloves and swabs) (Figure 2), while sharp boxes were used for storing contaminated sharp wastes in 33 (60%) facilities. The primary method of disposal for contaminated sharps, contaminated non-sharps, and blood and blood products was an incinerator in 34 (78%), 42 (76%) and 17 (31%) facilities, respectively. Disposal of contaminated but treated blood and blood products and of chemical/toxic agents was through sinks in 17 (31%) and 20 (36%) facilities, respectively. At health posts, we observed staff in three (27%) wearing protective gloves when performing RDTs. All biohazardous materials were properly labelled and stored in three (27%) health posts. Of health posts, one (9%) had hand-washing facilities available, eight (73%) used waste bins for storing contaminated non-sharp supplies, and nine (81%) used burning for disposing of contaminated supplies. Of 58 facilities reportedly performing malaria microscopy laboratory services, microscopy was actually available at only 51 (88%); reasons for unavailability of microscopic diagnosis included lack of functional microscopes, supplies, or lack of trained staff in microscopy. RDT malaria diagnosis was available in 24 (41%) of 58 malaria microscopy laboratory centres and 19 of these facilities used both microscopy and RDTs for malaria diagnosis. When available, RDTs were reportedly used in place of microscopy during busy laboratory working conditions when additional microscopy workload would cause excessive delays in clinical management, and when laboratory staff were not available. Haemoglobin estimation was performed in 39 (67%) facilities, with use of colorimetry, hematocrit, and automated analyzer techniques in 27 (69%), 17 (44%) and 4 (10%) of the facilities, respectively. Malaria blood films were performed in 51 (88%) facilities; 16 (31%) performed both thick and thin blood films; 34 (67%) performed only thick blood films; and one (2%) facility performed only thin blood films. All surveyed facilities reported using Giemsa staining for thick and thin films, with two facilities using additionally Wright's stain for thin films. Among the 51 facilities where blood films were performed, malaria species identification was observed in 39 (77%) and reported in 12 (23%) facilities, while malaria parasite quantification was observed in 11 (22%) and reported in 3 (6%) facilities. In all facilities performing malaria parasite quantification, the plus system (World Health Organization 1991) was used. RDTs for malaria were reportedly used in 16 facilities, but we also observed evidence of RDT use in an additional eight facilities, making a total of 24 facilities. Clinicians reportedly discussed laboratory results with laboratory staff in 28 (52%) of surveyed facilities, with laboratory personnel usually repeating the malaria tests should clinicians disagree with the original laboratory diagnostic test result. Clinicians at 60% and 25% of surveyed facilities reportedly treated febrile patients with negative blood films with ACTs and with CQ, respectively. At the 58 microscopy laboratory facilities, a register recorded malaria laboratory results in 52 (90%); laboratory request forms were reportedly used at 32 (55%) facilities but only observed to be completed in 20 of these (63%). Between January and December 2008, the mean monthly number of blood films processed was 225 and the mean monthly number of parasitologically confirmed malaria cases per facility was 56. Of the total 34 536 confirmed cases at all facilities, 17 426 (50%) and 15 240 (44%) were because of P. vivax and P. falciparum, respectively; the remainder were mixed infections. In assessed health posts, registers or record books for recording malaria RDT test results were available in eight (73%). Between January to December 2008, the mean monthly number of clinical malaria cases seen was 75 per health post, of which a mean 57 (76%) were tested by RDTs. None of the surveyed laboratory facilities had formal QA/QC protocols for either microscopy or RDTs. Of 51 facilities performing blood films, 25 (49%) reportedly recycled slides, 24 (47%) discarded used slides and two saved slides for QA purposes. Slides were re-read for internal QC purposes in 10 (20%) facilities, but none of these kept QC records. No health facility reported re-reading of slides through external QC. External supervisory visits (done by the ORHB and/or Zonal Health Office) in the last 6 months were reported in 36 (62%) of surveyed facilities, with only 3 (8%) reporting that visits included review of malaria microscopy or RDTs as well as quarterly feedback on staff performance by the supervisor. Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) for malaria blood film preparation and reading was observed in four (7%) facilities and none had SOPs for use of RDTs. Bench aids for malaria microscopy were available in eight (14%) facilities; none had bench aids for RDTs. QA protocols were lacking in all health posts surveyed, but in four health posts, HEW's re-read each other's RDTs for QC. No samples tested by RDT were submitted to a RRL for QC in any form nor were records kept at health posts showing internal QC. External supervision (done by ZHO and DHO) in the last 6 months was reported by all health posts; visits included review of RDTs in seven (64%) health posts, of which 4 received feedback on their performance from the supervisor. None of the health posts had SOPs or bench aids. Following guidance from Global Malaria Action Plan (Roll Back Malaria Partnership 2008) and utilizing the substantial increase in international donor funding support for malaria prevention and control programmes, many countries across sub-Saharan Africa are scaling-up malaria prevention and control interventions, including insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying of households, and provision of early diagnosis and treatment. WHO and GMAP both emphasize that presumptive treatment for malaria should be minimized, and suspected malaria cases in all age groups should be confirmed by laboratory diagnosis (World Health Organization 2009). As the proportion of fevers because of malaria will drop after the scale-up of malaria efforts, it is crucial that only true malaria cases receive antimalarial treatment (Anonymous 2006). Although reliable tools exist to enable accurate malaria diagnosis even at community level (D'Acremont et al. 2009), requirements for diagnosis may be variable for different tiers of the health service delivery system (Long 2009). It is also evident that strengthening malaria diagnosis is fundamental for strengthening the whole of a country's laboratory services (Birx et al. 2009; Nkengasong 2009). Published, peer-reviewed literature on in-country malaria (and in general laboratory) diagnostic capacity is scant, with data almost exclusively coming from assessment reports available in the grey literature (Kassu & Aseffa 1999; World Health Organization 2003; National Bureau of Statistics Tanzania & Macro International Inc. 2007; National Institute of Statistics Rwanda, Ministry of Health Rwanda, and Macro International Inc. 2007; Ministry of Health Uganda & Macro International Inc. 2008). Unpublished reports on malaria diagnostic capacity from various countries in Africa have been compiled by the PMI-funded Improving Malaria Diagnostics project, from which the questionnaire used for this survey was adapted (J. Carter, personal communication). While our assessment indicated that malaria laboratory diagnosis, either by microscopy or RDTs, was available in most facilities surveyed (90%), the assessment revealed significant gaps in laboratory services' functions that could impact on quality and accessibility of malaria diagnosis, such as laboratory infrastructure, equipment, laboratory supplies and human resources. Data such as those presented here should help inform planning, budgeting, and developing strategies to strengthen laboratory capacity to diagnose malaria (Ohrt et al. 2007). Clearly, some of the needs and gaps identified are more easily addressed (e.g. supply of gloves) than others (e.g. access to water, electricity, refrigeration) and may require little (e.g. provision of laboratory coats) or more substantial policy and financial support (e.g. availability of staff positions and training). Findings from this assessment have been used to design and now implement activities to strengthen laboratory capacity for malaria diagnosis in Oromia, using PMI support. For example, facilities with non-functional microscopes have been equipped with microscopes (including microscope repair kits); and all laboratories have been provided with an estimated year's consumption of laboratory reagents and supplies to ensure that blood slide examination is not interrupted. Both clinical and laboratory facility staff are being (re-)trained in malaria diagnostic issues, addressing microscopy, RDTs, laboratory safety and QA/QC. An external quality assessment (EQA) system has been developed (Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute 2010) and is now being implemented under the leadership of EHNRI and in collaboration with ORHB and ICAP-CU. Moreover, the FMOH's decision in 2009 to change from single-species RDTs capable of detecting P. falciparum to multi-species RDTs capable of detecting both P. falciparum and non-P. falciparum species (Ashton et al. 2010) should improve malaria case management. While lot-testing of RDTs at the WHO RDT Lot Testing Reference Laboratories in Muntinlupa City, Phnom Penh or Addis Ababa is a pre-requisite to distribution, the EQA system in place will be able to monitor the quality of RDTs at field level (Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute 2010). Standardized assessments such as ours or the similar Service Provision Assessments (National Bureau of Statistics Tanzania & Macro International Inc. 2007; National Institute of Statistics Rwanda, Ministry of Health Rwanda, and Macro International Inc. 2007; Ministry of Health Uganda & Macro International Inc. 2008) are crucial to define requirements needed to strengthen various aspects of health services delivery, including a country's capacity for malaria laboratory diagnosis. These and other health systems strengthening efforts are crucial for reducing malaria morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia.

N2  - Abstract Background Malaria vectors control interventions mainly rely on the control of adults using indoor residual sprayings and long-lasting insecticidal nets in Ethiopia. However, the emergence and widespread of insecticide resistance in the primary malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae sinso lato challenges the malaria vector control efforts in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to investigate species composition, abundance and insecticide resistance status of main malaria mosquitoes in Assosa district, Benishangul Gumuz, Western Ethiopia. Methods The study was conducted from July 2021 to June 2022. After identification of possible breeding sites, Anopheles mosquito larvae were collected using a standard dipper from varies breeding habitats. Susceptibility tests were conducted on wild population of female An. gambiae complex following World health organization standard susceptibility test procedure. Insecticide impregnated papers with deltamethrin (0.05%), alphacypermethrine (0.05%), propoxur (0.1%), and primiphos methyl (0.25%), were used for the study. Result Six major Anopheles mosquitoes’ larvae breeding habitats were identified in four villages, namely, drainage ditch, swamp, pond, animal footprint, sewerage and stagnant water. A total of 2051 Anopheles larvae were collected and identified. Out of all collected Anopheles larvae, 1884 larvae were reared and identified to four species (An. gambiae s.l., An. coustani, An. ziemanni and An. funestus). An. gambiae s.l. were found to be the dominant species (1732, 84.4%) species and the lowest An. funestus were collected (n = 17, 0.9%). The most productive habitats were stagnant water (n = 752; 39. 9%) with larvae/dip while sewerage were detected to be least productive (n = 71; 3.76%) for Anopheles mosquito larvae with mean density of 1.2 and 0.03 larvae/dip, respectively, (P &lt; 0.05). The susceptibility result indicated that the population of An. gambiae s.l in the study area found resistant against alphacypermethrine, deltamethrin and permethrin 63%, 71% and 43% respectively. The result revealed that the vector is susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl and propoxur with 100% susceptibility rate. Conclusion Anopheles gambiae complex is the predominant malaria vector in Assosa District. Anopheles gambiae complex developed high level of resistance against most of insecticide classes. Pirmiphosmethyl and propoxur are effective insecticides for malaria vector control in Assosa district, Ethiopia.

N2  - To elucidate the larvicidal potency of neem, chinaberry and Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) to larvae of Anopheles arabiensis under semi-field condition and adult susceptibility/resistance to the conventionally used insecticides in Tolay, Southwestern Ethiopia. Wild collected 3rd and 4th stage larvae were exposed to neem, and chinaberry seed powder dissolved in water and Bti in artificial containers at three treatment levels: 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 g/m2 and controls were free of treatments. Larval and pupal mortalities were monitored daily and residual activities were determined. The experiments were replicated three times. The World Health Organization tube test for all classes of insecticides was conducted on adult Anopheles arabiensis reared from field collected larvae and pupae. Data were analyzed using STATA software version 11. In the first application, neem powder caused 88.9%, 87.9% and 79.4% larval and pupal mortality at 0.2, 0.1 and 0.05 g/m2 after 4.3, 6.0 and 5.7 days, respectively. The corresponding killing effect of chinaberry was 80.3%, 62.1% and 30.3% after 7.0, 7.7 and 8.3 days respectively. Bti at all treatments killed 100% after 24 h except 2.7 days for 0.05 g/m2. Adult mosquitoes were susceptible only for fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl with 100% mortality while resistant to deltamethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, etofenprox and dichloro-diphenyl-tricgloroethane with only 9.0%, 3.0%, 5.1% and 2.0% mortalities respectively. Neem, chinaberry and Bti showed potent larvicidal and pupicidal activities. However, in the area, high level of mosquito resistance to pyrethroids and dichloro-diphenyl-tricgloroethane was seen which will pose serious challenge to vector control in the future. Therefore, using integrated approach including these botanical larvicides is warranted to manage insecticide resistance.

N2  - Abstract Background: Despite tremendous efforts made to curb malaria morbidity and mortality, malaria control has slowed down due to resistance to all currently used insecticides by mosquitoes, and their negative effect on the non-target organisms and the ecosystem. Thus, there is an urgent need to search and develop new plant-based malaria vector control strategy from medicinal plants origin such as essential oil. Methods: Larvicidal effect was tested against the fourth instar An. arabiensis wild larvae whilst freshly laid ova of An . arabiensis were used to determine ovicidal activity of the essential oil at concentrations ranging from 6.25 to 400 ppm. Concentrations of 41.6–366.7 µg/cm 2 were used to evaluate repellent activity of the essential oil on 3–5 days old adult female An. Arabiensis . The essential oil composition of Leucas stachydiformis was also analyzed using GC-MS. Results: Larvicidal, ovicidal and repellent activities of the essential oil extracted by hydrodistillation from leaves of the endemic Ethiopian plant Leucas stachydiformis (Hochst. ex Benth.) Briq was investigated against Anopheles arabiensis , the dominant malaria vector species in Ethiopia. The study revealed that the oil possesses the highest larvicidal activity at 400 ppm and 200 ppm after 24 h and 48 h treatment. LC 50 values for the fourth larval instar after 24 h and 48 h treatment were 43.4 ppm and 34.2 ppm, respectively. After 72 h exposure, the oil displayed 100% ovicidal activity at 400 ppm with IH 50 value of 32.2 ppm. In the repellency test, at concentrations of 366.7, 133.3 and 41.6 µg/cm 2 , the oil gave total percentage protection of 67.9 ± 4.2%, 37.2 ± 2.8% and 32 ± 2.2%, respectively, for 4 hours. The highest concentration (366.7 µg/cm 2 ) gave 100% protection up to 90 min. GC-MS analyses of the oil revealed the presence of 24 compounds representing 90.34% of the total oil with caryophyllene oxide, germacrene D, and trans -caryophyllene constituting more than 50% of its components. Conclusion: Results of the present study suggest that the essential oil of L . stachydiformis has the potential to be used for the control of An. arabiensis mosquitos.

N2  - The current need to produce marketable vegetables entails increasing pressure to use agricultural pesticides. However, information on the type of pesticide residues, the concentration in the soil, and their prolonged impacts is lacking in developing countries such as Ethiopia. Therefore, the present work was conducted to identify the types of pesticide residues and measure their concentration in the soil. Surface soil samples were collected from vegetable‐growing farmlands. The types of pesticide residues and their concentrations in the samples were analyzed using LC‐MS/MS triple quadrant with an ESI ion source. The physicochemical properties of the soils were also determined following appropriate procedures. The analytical method was accurate with a percentage recovery of 71%–120% and acceptable with correlation coefficients greater than 0.992. The detection limits and quantifications were within the range of 0.3–1 and 1–3.3 μg/kg, respectively. A total of ten different pesticide residues were found, of which diazinon, dimethoate, malathion, metalaxyl, and profenofos were found in all samples. Profenofos and metalaxyl were the pesticide residues found at high concentrations (116.16 and 106.03 μg/kg, respectively). The textural classes of the samples were clay‐loam with high acidity, which might be associated with the intensive application of pesticides. The results revealed that different pesticide residues were present in the soil, some of which are persistent and hazardous to health and the environment. Authorities must take appropriate measures to reduce the impact on health and ensure sustainable soil productivity in the area.

N2  - Abstract The levels of 27 selected pesticides and trophic biomagnification of DDT were investigated in biota samples of the Lake Ziway in the Rift valley region, Ethiopia. Pesticide residues were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC MS). Carbon source and trophic position were calculated by using 13 C and 15 N stable isotopes, individually, and trophic magnification factors (TMFs) were inferred. Among pesticides analyzed, only DDT and its metabolites (o,pʹ-DDD, o,pʹ-DDE, p,pʹ-DDD, and p,pʹ-DDE) were quantified in biota samples. The most prominent metabolite was p,pʹ-DDE with mean concentration ranging from the 0.22-7.7ngg − 1 wet weight. Moreover, the ratio of DDT/DDD + DDE in all the biota samples was less than 1 signifying historical DDT application. The trophic magnification factor (TMF) for p,pʹ-DDE, and ΣDDT were 1.18 and 1.19 respectively. Regression of log [ΣDDT] vs TL (trophic level) among all biota species showed a significant correlation, indicating that DDTs are biomagnifying along with the food web of Lake Ziway. The concentrations of DDTs and other organochlorine pesticides found in biota from Lake Ziway were, in general, lower than studies found in previous studies carried out in the same lake.

N2  - <title>Abstract</title> In the southwestern Ethiopia there is huge livestock population with dense forest that requires more extensive assessment and documentation on poisonous plants, which are a neglected research area. Therefore this research was conducted to identify livestock poisoning plants with their respective ecology, seasons of occurrences and to assess effect on livestock production performance in the region from February to November 2022 with our key informants of farmers, traditional animal healers, and veterinarians. Structured questionnaire were used to collect information related to toxic plants for livestock and their associated risk factors. The most common poisoning plants identified in the study area includes Datura stramonium, Rumex crispus, Prosopis juliflora Ajuga alba, Solanum americanum, Amaranthus cruentus, Albizia gummifera, Cyperus rotundus, Uebelinia kiwuensis Xanthium strumarium, Tribulus terestris, Medicago polymorpha, Euphorbia tirucalli, Hedera canariensis and Trifolium burchelianum. Lack of green feed, shortage of pastures and overgrazing are the predisposing factors for livestock to consume poisoning plants. Most of the livestock poisoning plants were distributed in all agroecologies of lowland, midland, highland. Those poisonous plants were growing in the early rainy season and green in the dry season as well. Bovine species are the most frequently poisoned livestock followed by sheep, goats and equine by showing different symptoms. Traditional animal healers and farmers used different treatment mechanisms to relieve their poisoned animals by providing a mixture of soap and ash, soap with milk and cold water, garlic, alcohol, and other plant roots or leaves at different ratio, depending on the species of animal affected and type of poison. Physical control, biological mechanism and herbicide application of the infested areas by toxic plant, good range management, and wise grazing strategies can reduce the degree of poisoning of livestock.

N2  - Malaria among pregnant women contributes to maternal anemia, low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, and infant deaths. In response to this serious health problem, regular use of the long-lasting insecticidal net is the most cost-effective method of preventing malaria. However, in most developing countries, including Ethiopia, long-lasting insecticidal net utilization by pregnant women is uncertain.This study was conducted to measure the utilization of insecticidal net and to identify the associated factors with its utilization among pregnant women in Asgede Tsimbla district in 2017.A community-based cross-sectional study was employed and data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. Systematic random sampling method was used to select 550 pregnant women. Data were entered into a computer using Epi Info (version 7) and exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 21) for further analysis. Variables with P-value less than 0.05 were used to declare statistical significance between the dependent and the independent variables in multivariable logistic regression.Among 550 pregnant women surveyed, 347 (63.1%) of the pregnant women slept under a long-lasting insecticidal net the night before the survey. Urban residence (OR [95% CI] = 1.9 [1.22-3.01]), family size of 3-5 and >5 (2.8 [1.53-5.22] and 2.4 [1.20-5.03], respectively), and history of malaria during their current pregnancy (3.0 [1.95-4.86]) were found to be the factors associated with pregnant women's long-lasting insecticidal net utilization.Utilization of long-lasting insecticidal net was low, and place of residence, exposure status to malaria during their current pregnancy, and family size were the factors associated with long-lasting insecticidal net utilization.

N2  - Stem rust caused by <i>Puccinia graminis</i> f.sp. <i>tritici</i> is one of the major biotic constraints of wheat production. The disease may cause substantial quantitative and qualitative yield losses but much of the work in Ethiopia on this pathosystem focuses on quantitative yield loss of durum wheat. This work was carried out at Debre Zeit Agriculture Research Centre during 2015/16 and 2016/17 main and off seasons. Hence the current study was conducted with the objectives to quantify the amount of loss in grain yield due to stem rust and assess the relationship between disease parameters, grain yield and physical quality parameters of improved durum wheat varieties grown in Ethiopia. Artificial inoculation was performed using a mixture of different dominant stem rust races. There were treated and untreated plots by fungicide that serves as protected and unprotected plots, respectively. Disease severity was recorded each 10 days interval and area under disease progress curve (AUDPC), terminal severity and coefficient of infection were calculated. The tested cultivars exhibited different disease severity level, having the mean value of 6.7-76%. High values of area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) were detected on Hitossa, Utuba (1225.7, 585.9). Whereas the lowest values of yield loss were recorded on cvs. Mangudo and Utuba having the mean value of yield loss 40.2 and 44.8%, respectively. The highest yield loss was observed on susceptible variety Hitosa showing the mean value of 70%. Correlation coefficients were tested between yield losses and values of AUDPC, final stem rust severity, coefficient of infection and rate of infection of the tested cultivars. There was strong correlation coefficients among disease parameters (r=0.72-0.99). There was also moderate strong negative correlation coefficient among disease parameters and yield, hectoliter weight and 1000-kernel weight of the test cultivars (r=-0.53 to -0.81). The current study indicated that application of Rex Duo can be used in minimizing yield losses caused by stem rust disease of durum wheat. Therefore, supporting the released durum wheat cultivars with fungicide application is the most pertinent issue in Ethiopia as most of the durum wheat cultivars in farmers hand were moderately susceptible to susceptible cultivars Pgt races.

N2  - As Sub-Saharan African country urban malaria is potential catastrophe in Ethiopia, particularly in relation to rapidly growing small towns, which requires updating the epidemiology of malaria. There was lack of information regarding the study area, hence this study was designed to determine the prevalence of malaria and associated risk factors in Damboya town. A Community-based cross-sectional study was carried from March 7 to May 29, 2023 among 422 randomly selected participants. Prevalence of malaria was determined using microscopic examination of thick and thin smear and rapid diagnostic test using kits to standard of the manufacturer. Pretested structured questionnaire was employed to collect socio-demographic data and associated risk factors. Data were entered in Epi data 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 25 software. Factors associated with malaria was analyzed using bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression. The strength of the association was determined by computing Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) at Malaria is one of the most vital leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries particularly in Sub Saharan Africa (Bugssa and Tedla, 2020). About 95 % of all malaria cases and 96 % of all malaria deaths in 2021 occurred in Africa (Bugssa and Tedla, 2020). Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 60 % of global cases and 90 % of global fatalities (WHO, 2022). Over the two peak years of the pandemic (2020-2021), COVID-related setbacks increased malaria cases by around 13 million and fatalities by 63,000 (WHO, 2022). Malaria is thought to directly cost Africa $12 billion annually and reduce GDP growth by 3 %. In addition, it is thought to cause cognitive disorders and school absences, which are barriers to the development of human capital (Monroe et al., 2022). 95 % confidence interval (CI) and p-value of < 0.05. The prevalence of malaria was 5 % (20, 95 % CI: 3-7), Plasmodium vivix account for 14 (61.9 %) of the infection. Presence of stagnant water (AOR = 3.630, 95 % CI: 1-13, P < 0.049), unavailability of Insecticide-treated bed net (AOR = 3.89, 95 % CI: 1.08-14.01, P < 0.038), living in a house with eaves (AOR = 5.06, 95 %CI: 1.25-20.58, p < 0.023), travel history (AOR = 3.58, 95 %CI: 1-12.79, p < 0.049), low-income (AOR = 5.3, 95 %CI: 1.09-25.2, P < 0.038), were significantly associated with malaria occurrence. Malaria is still a public health concern in Damboya town. Thus, implementing intervention strategies properly and evaluate the access and utilization status of the suburb community and improve accordingly was required to interrupt the transmission in the community of this town.

N2  - Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most abundantly produced cereal in the world. It is one of the most popular crops grown in the world, ranking second to wheat and used as a staple food in the tropics. It is the most versatile crop, adaptable to different agro-ecological and climatic conditions. Maize is among the leading cereal crops selected to achieve food self-sufficiency in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, maize is the staple food and one of the main sources of calories, particularly in the major maizeproducing regions of the country. The major constraints to maize production in the country include both abiotic and biotic factors, such as droughts, nutrient deficiencies, weeds, diseases, and insect pests. Among the biotic stresses, diseases are one of the most important limiting factors in maize production. Diseases such as common rust, maize lethal necrosis, gray leaf spot, and turcicum leaf blight diseases are the major constraints in realizing the potential yield loss of this crop. Even though these diseases are the major problems for the crop, there are some disease management options are Using disease resistant cultivars, crop rotation, using fungicides and planting disease free plants are the best methods.

N2  - Abstract Background ; Malaria is caused by one or more of the five species of plasmodium species that can infect by the bite of female Anopheles. In Ethiopia, about 68% of the total population resides in areas with high malaria risk and 2,174,707 cases and 662 deaths due to malaria were reported in 2014–2015 with case fatality rate of 0.03%. The outbreak was reported on April 22/2019 (WHO week 17) then we investigate the outbreak to describe the magnitude of morbidity and mortality due to malaria outbreak, identify the etiologic agent and investigate factors associated with an occurrence of malaria outbreak. Methods ; we conducted case control study in Bolosso Sore woreda. We used outbreak investigation questionnaire to asses’ risk factor for both cases and controls of patients. We collected 75 cases and 150 controls by face to face interview by administered questionnaire. We analysed the data with Epi Info.Version7.2.0.1 and SPSS.V 23 and the statistical we used 95% CI. Result; the overall attack rate of the woreda was 36.4 per 1000. From the cases Males are slightly more affected than females (38: 37) .The most affected age group is &gt;15 years, 54 (72%) followed by 5-14, 17(22.7%). Plasmodium falcifarem is the highest proportion of malaria in the wereda. Having impregnated treated net have no problem but impregnated treated net who have used sometimes (AOR 10.214; 95% CI) was identified as a risk factor for malaria or more likely affected by malaria ten times each respectively than those impregnated treated net used always. Conclusion; Presence of intermittent rivers nearest to the community, open deep well near to their home and usage of impregnated treated net (those impregnated treated net use sometimes and never use impregnated treated net) were risk factors for onset/occurrence of the outbreak of malaria. We recommend all malarias area insecticide treated bed net should be distributed for all households according to their family member. Beside this, utilization of bed net should be monitored and optimized.

N2  - Over 60% (60 million) of Ethiopian populations live in areas at risk for malaria. On June 17 /2017, surveillance data from BenaTsemay district showed that the district was experiencing an unusual high number of malaria cases in three kebeles (lowest administrative unit). We investigated the outbreak to describe malaria epidemiology in the district, identify population risk factors, and guide intervention measures for the community. Malaria case records from the District Health Office were reviewed to describe the outbreak. Unmatched case-control study was conducted with 60 randomly selected cases and 119 controls using a semi-structured questionnaire. Malaria cases were confirmed by either microscopy or malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) from June 5 to July 23/2017. Controls were persons with no diagnosis of malaria, and lives in similar kebele. Environmental assessment, observation of ownership and utilization of insecticide treated bed-nets (ITNs) were carried out. Multivariable regression model analysis was conducted to identify independent malaria risk factors. There were 648 malaria cases (50.3%-males) from three kebeles with no deaths recorded. The overall attack rate (AR) was 114/1000 populations, and it was highest in Sille kebele (167/1000 populations) and among 5-14 years old (179/1000 populations). Age <5 years (AOR=8.5; 95%CI: 1.2-59), living near mosquito breeding sites (AOR=6.5; 95%CI: 1.15-36.5), irregular use of ITNs (AOR=8.7; 95%CI: 1.5-49.6), inadequate ITNs per family size (AOR=13.4; 95%CI: 1.9-93) predicted having of malaria. Wearing long sleeved clothes was a protective factor (AOR=0.6; 95%C.I: 0.004-0.96). Several unmanaged stagnated water sources with Anopheles mosquito larvae, and the use of ITNs for other purposes were observed. The outbreak was associated with presence of nearby vector-breeding sites, and poor access and utilization of ITNs. Adequate information should be given along ITNs for the community in addition to early management of nearby vector-breeding sites to prevent similar outbreak in future.

N2  - Abstract Background In Ethiopia, malaria is highly seasonal in many communities with epidemic-prone transmission patterns and serious public health emergencies that have a major impact on health and the economy. This investigation aimed to assess malaria outbreaks, identify their risk factors and provide appropriate control &amp; prevention measures of the infection in Siraro district,west Arsi,Oromia,Ethiopia. Methods A unmatched case-control study with a 1:1 case-to-control ratio was conducted in the Siraro District from 16 June 2021 to 03 August 2021. Seventy-four randomly selected cases and controls participated in this study. We reviewed the previous five year’s malaria data to establish a threshold level. Both descriptive and analytical statistical procedures were performed. The data were entered using Epi-Info version 7.2.4.0 software and analyzed by using SPSS version 25. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent factors associated with malaria infection. Results plasmodium Falciparum accounts for about 81.4%.

N2  - Abstract Background: Ethiopia has achieved remarkable progresses in the prevention and control of malaria in the past decades, yet it is a formidable health concern and socio-economic impediment. This study aimed at assessing the magnitude and knowledge, attitudes and practices towards malaria among febrile patients attending Chagni health center, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: In the health facility based cross-sectional study, patients attending health center with suspicion of malaria symptoms and signs, were enlisted. To determine the magnitude of malaria, finger prick blood samples were collected from malaria suspected patients visiting health center between September 2017 and February 2018. A pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire was also applied to assess KAP of suspected malaria patients attending the health center. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Results: Prevalence of malaria among febrile patients attending at the sampled health facility was 7.3%. Of these, Plasmodium falciparum , P . vivax , and mixed infection accounted for 55, 44.3 and 0.7% of the cases, respectively. This study also revealed that 97% of the respondents had ever heard about malaria and recognized it as a serious health problem. Mosquito bite was identified as the main malaria transmission. Taking drug (86.3%), use of mosquito nets (73.3%), drain stagnated water (68%), and house spay with insecticides (66%) were mentioned as the main malaria prevention methods. Mosquito net coverage and its utilization in the previous night were 98% and 75%, respectively. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) coverage was 99%, of which 77.5% of houses of participants were get sprayed in the last six months. Conclusions: The current study revealed that prevalence of malaria among febrile illnesses in the study area was relatively low (7.3%) with a high proportion of P. falciparum . Besides, participants had adequate knowledge, encouraging attitudes, and good practices about prevention and control of malaria. However, some misconceptions on malaria disease, its transmission, and prevention have been noted that actually require due attention by the concerned stakeholders. We believe that findings of this study would make inroads into the implementation effective malaria interventions in the area and beyond focusing on enhancing community awareness and scaling up coverage of evidence-based interventions.

N2  - The development of hosts that are resistant and evaluation of botanical extracts to H. armigera Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is crucial for sustainable management, yet very limited in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was done to identify alternative methods to insecticide control through host consumption study and botanical extracts. The performance of third-fifth larval stages of H. armigera on three host plant varieties including chickpea, tomato and faba bean and botanical extracts against the third larval instars and oviposition deterrence was studied under laboratory condition (22°C ± 2°C, 55% ± 5% RH, 12:12 L: D photoperiod). Significant differences were found in the efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI%) (F = 80.06; df = 6, 2; p H. armigera reared on the three host plant varieties of the whole larval instars. The minimum relative consumption rate (RCR) (11.271 ± 0.328) and maximum approximate digestibility (AD) (177.9 ± 1.928) values of the whole larval instars were on Dagaga and Koshari, respectively. The values of relative growth rate (RGR), ECI% and ECD% of the whole larval instars were highest on chickpea varieties and lowest on tomato Koshari. Among chickpea varieties, Habru was relatively resistant to larval instars of H. armigera. Botanical extracts at 50% neem oil (NO), 5% birbira seed extract (BSE) and 5% neem seed extract (NSE) (18.4%) resulted superior in larval mortality however, statistically not different. At both 5% and 2.5% concentration level of botanical extracts the minimum larval mortality was recorded from neem leaf extract (NLE). Maximum numbers of eggs were laid on control treatments and the minimum eggs were on 5% BSE. The deterrent effect of 50% neem oil was stronger (ODI = 17.66%) than that of 5% BSE (ODI = 14%) which is statistically similar value with 5% NSE (ODI = 13%). In conclusion, the result indicated that use of Habru chickpea variety with 50% NO was very effective in controlling both the larvae and deterring the adults of H. armigera from egg lying. These measures could be important in the wider managements of H. armigera by integrating host resistance and botanical extracts.

N2  - The recently introduced chalcid pest known as the Blue Gum Chalcid (BGC) (L. invasa) is currently one of the major insect pests of Eucalyptus tree species in Ethiopia. A research was conducted in Kalu district, South Wollo, Eastern Amhara, Ethiopia, the main objective of which was to evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic insecticides, hoeing and water showering options against BGC. Two parallel experiments were conducted in the nursery and in the field. Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. saligna, E. viminalis, E. citrodora and E. globulus were considered in the nursery at Chorisa. One to three-year old E. camaldulensis plantations were considered at Tikuro plantation site. At the nursery, seven treatments and at the field 10 treatments were tested in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications from January to February 2019, where treatments were applied 3 times at 15-day intervals. Results from the 1-year old plantation revealed that application of Dimethoate 40%, Carbofuran 3G and Dimethoate 40% + hoeing followed by Carbofuran 3G + hoeing and Thiamethoxam 25WG were effective in checking the BGC insect pest infestation. In the 3-year old plantation, Carbofuran 3G significantly reduced the infestation followed by Dimethoate 40%. At the nursery, Dimethoate 40% and Carbofuran 3G reduced the infestation followed by Carbofuran 3G + Dimethoate 40% and thiamethoxam 25WG. Water showering and hoeing did not reduce BGC infestation in all cases at the field plantations. Treatments that received synthetic insecticides and hoeing had low infestation, the reason for which was the insecticide rather than the hoeing, because the hoeing alone didn’t differ from the control. Application of Dimethoate 40% and Carbofuran 3G with hoeing and weeding activities were recommended to manage and limit BGC insect pest infestations.

N2  - The study conducted evaluated potential of extracts of selected plant species and chemicals on growth of P. hysterophorus. Since the impact of parthenium weed has become to the status of being an extensive economic and social problems of Ethiopian farmers. The experiment identified herbicidal potential of Aregemon mexicana leaf, stem and root extracts and 2, 4-D on seed germination and early seedling growths of parthenium at under field pot condition. Aqueous extracts of 6, 8 and 10 % (w/v), obtained from dry leaves, stem root of Aregemon mexicana plants and 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 % of 2, 4-D herbicide. The overall germination, shoot and root growth means of A. mexicana extract and 2, 4-D, herbicidal treatments were significant (p&lt;0.0001). Germination hinder by 2, 4-D and A. mexicana stem extracts, which inhibited the germination by (74.4 and 69.3 %) respectively from the control (82.2 %) and the lowest was A. mexicana root extract (54.8 %) in invitro. In the pot experiment the overall growth parameter means of plant extract and herbicidal treatments were significantly lower than the distilled water treated plants. A. mexicana stem resulted 100 % mortality at active growth stage of the parthenium plant, and 2, 4- D also showed best suppressed growth effects. A. mexicana leaf and root gave remarkable seed suppression of (93-94%) at 10 % concentration. Then we conclude that species like A. Mexicana and chemicals like 2, 4-D and are good candidates for future parthenium management. The Small holder farmers adopted mechanical control measures, while, it is most serious is not tackled by these farmers, integrate with other management options such as competitive plants and chemicals may appear to be satisfactory. However further research is required to progress our understanding of the interference mechanisms between parthenium and these species, on how to integrate with other management options and cost effectiveness of the methods.

N2  - The potato is an important tuberous vegetable crop. However, its production and values are constrained by various factors, including the two-spotted spider mite (TSSM) in East Hararghe, Ethiopia. An investigation of the TSSM management by the application of botanicals and synthetic insecticides was conducted in the laboratory and greenhouse. The experiment was arranged in CRD. The treatment was replicated four times in the greenhouse and five times in the laboratory. The efficacy and LC50 bioassays of Amitraz, Profenofos, and Emamectin benzoate, as well as the oils of Azadirachta indica seed and Tagetes minuta leaf, and their leaf aqueous extracts, were tested in the laboratory at three dose levels. Similarly, Amitraz, Profenofos, Emamectin benzoate (EB) and extracted oils of Azadirachta indica seed alone and in combination were tested in a greenhouse The data was collected after 24, 48, and 72 hours of their application in the laboratory. And in the greenhouse, within 7, 14, and 21 days before and after application. In the laboratory, the highest mortality of TSSM adults was recorded with EB at 80 µL (74–97%), followed by profenofos at 35 µL (71–90%). Among the botanicals, the A. indica seed oil at 5% caused the highest mortality of TSSM adults (72–100%). Amitraz also caused the highest mortality of TSSM eggs (72.5–92.5%), and it required in 100ml of tap water to kill 50% of the eggs. T. minuta leaf oil had higher toxic effects on TSSM eggs (0.239%). In the greenhouse, the dose combination of Amitraz, EB, and profenofos caused higher mortality of TSSM than their sole application.

N2  - Abstract Background: - Birth defects are congenital anomalies that are present at birth of the neonate, and can be structural, functional, or metabolic. Structural birth defects are those that affect the development of body part. Failure of the neural tube to close at different regions result in positional variations of neural tube defects (NTDs). It is caused through multifactorial disorders, arising from a complex combination of genetic determinants and environmental factors. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the maternal risk factor associated with NTDs among pregnant outcome in Debre Berhan Referral Hospital, North Shewa, Ethiopia. Methods: - Hospital based unmatched case control study was conducted among 50 cases and 100 controls for associated risk factors of NTDs. The study was carried out at Debre Berhan Referral Hospital from August 30/2017 to August 30/2019. The data was checked for completeness and consistencies, and cleaned, coded and entered using Epi data version 4.2 and was exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 20 for analysis. Variables having p&lt;0.05 was consider as statistically significant. Results: - In this study 50 cases and 100 controls were employed. Logistic regression analysis showed that maternal age, &lt;20 (p=0.046), maternal age 31-35 (p=0.028), no education (p=0.014), family history of NTDs (p=0.034), history of multiparous (p=0.002), history of abortion (p=0.024) and still birth (p=0.009), No ANC follow up, unplanned pregnancy (p=0.000), history of medical illness (p=0.001), hyperthermia (p=0.000), used antipyretics drugs (p=0.002), Never use of folic acid and oral contraceptive use (p=0.001), exposure to smoking (p=0.001) and pesticides (p=0.000), and use of local alcohol (p=0.000) had significant association with NTDs. Conclusions: - Family history of NTDs, coffee and alcohol consumption, maternal no education, maternal hyperthermia and disease, maternal antipyretic use, maternal age &lt;20 and 31-35, exposure to pesticides and smoking were associated with the increasing the risk of NTDs. Comprehensive preventive strategies focused on the identified risk factors should be established and early preconceptional maternal screening for genetic factors and medical illness as well as preconceptional folic acid supplementation are the effective possible approaches to bring about the required reduction in NTDs.

N2  - A two-year school-based malaria education intervention was developed to engage students as implementers in malaria prevention and control in the Oromia region, Ethiopia. The current study aimed to validate messenger students' engagement scale (MSES) in malaria education. The scale development process was done stepwise. Multiple behavioural theories were examined to derive possible domains of engagement. Next, a pool of items was developed by linking the domains with malaria target behaviours. The items critically reviewed, pretested and refined for clarity and appropriateness. A cross-sectional survey of 451 sample households with school-going children was conducted in five districts of the Jimma-Zone in March-2019. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)/principal component analysis (PCA) was executed to evaluate the construct validity of the scale. Rotated factor loading coefficients of ≥0.4 were retained. Items loaded on multiple factors were retained on the factor with a higher loading score. Cronbach's alpha of 0.7 was used as the cutoff point for reliability. Discriminative validity was declared based on Pearson correlation (between the extracted factors) coefficients that were moderate (r < 0.7), and less than the respective variance explained (VE) by each factor. The validity of convergence of domains with the overall MSES assessed (0.4 < r < 0.9). Logistic regression for key malaria preventive practices was conducted to assess predictive validity. The study explored a 24-item MSES in six domains of malaria education: reminding, supporting, monitoring, messenger credibility, role modelling and norm setting. The domains explained 67.82% variance of MSES, with a reliability of 93.3%. The factors were convergent with the overall scale (r = 0.764–0.834). Most factors were discriminative, with moderate correlation to each other. Adjusted odds ratios showed engaging credible students in reminding malaria preventive messages and modelling practices predicted exposure to message, insecticide-treated net (ITN) utilisation and cleaning surrounding. The current MSES is reliable, valid and predictive of malaria preventive practices.

N2  - Single-nutrient supplementation targeted at specific population groups has become an increasingly popular strategy to combat micronutrient malnutrition. This population-based approach is a pragmatic response to limited resources and assumes that, within a targeted group, the diagnosis of the nutrient deficiency is secure, its prevalence is clinically significant, and the benefits of supplementation outweigh the risks. The introduction of routine vitamin A supplementation to children in developing countries has encouraged this approach and the development of further micronutrient supplementation programs. The population-based approach, by definition, ignores individual variation in response caused by either genetic differences or clinical conditions, such as the presence of ongoing infection. The acute inflammatory response is a systemic adaptation that optimizes the immune response to an infection. Cytokines, such as interleukins (IL) 1 and 2 and tumour necrosis factor are released by leukocytes, macrophages, and mast cells in response to tissue injury and act on an array of cells to increase vascular permeability, to activate complement, and to promote chemotaxis. Plasma protein concentrations may increase, as with the positive acute-phase proteins C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, α-1-antitrypsin, fibrinogen, and ferritin, or they may decrease, as wth the negative acute-phase proteins albumin, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein. Inflammation also is associated with dramatic changes in plasma micronutrient concentrations. Changes in the micronutrient milieu may be the host's attempt to optimize immune function and to deprive invading organisms of essential micronutrients for replication. Iron and zinc are important in the immune response, and different plasma concentrations are associated with either immunostimulatory or suppressant effects. Intracellular pathogens compete with host cells for available micronutrients. Either micronutrient deficiency or supplementation can impair metabolic adaptation to maintain an optimal microenvironment during inflammation. Immune dysfunction may result from this or from genetic variations in cellular mechanisms that control micronutrient flux and competition. In this review, we first describe the key roles of iron and zinc in immune function and the effect of inflammation on their plasma concentrations. We next discuss the insights gained from clinical studies of children in developing countries in whom the metabolic response of plasma iron and zinc to inflammation has been disturbed by either deficiency or supplementation. Finally, we outline some newly characterized cellular mechanisms involved in transporting and in competing for these ions and demonstrate their clinical relevance. In reviewing the literature on iron or zinc supplementation and infection, we emphasize the variability of the immune response to supplementation and attempt to identify groups in which this variability is high. IRON AND THE ACUTE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE Serum iron decreases and catabolism of transferrin increases during inflammation, resulting in decreased transferrin concentrations with decreased iron saturation (1). Decreased release of iron from reticuloendothelial ferritin stores and decreased intestinal iron absorption augments this hypoferremic response. The observation that ferritin synthesis in human volunteers increased 4 to 8 hours after injection of a bacterial endotoxin underlies the tissue block in iron release (2). Polymorphonuclear leukocytes release lactoferrin during inflammation, which binds iron that is then taken up by macrophages. Iron deprivation limits bacterial growth and has long been proposed as an important adaptive mechanism to limit the growth of invading microorganisms (3). Hemoglobin and intracellular ferritin in the liver, bone marrow, and spleen account for more than 99% of total body iron. At physiologic pH, plasma iron is tightly bound to transferrin in the ferric form. Uptake and internalization of transferrin by endocytosis is followed by its dissociation at lower intracellular pH and storage of iron in cytoplasmic ferritin molecules. Free iron catalyzes the production of reactive oxygen species that damage both host and intracellular microbe cell membranes through lipid peroxidation. The hydroxyl radical is produced by either the Fenton or the Haber-Weiss reactions (4), and its generation represents an important intracellular killing mechanism. Invading organisms compete for available iron by secreting small, soluble iron chelators (siderophores) that are involved in both extracellular competition and transport across the microbial cell membrane. Mycobacteria are a good example of this, secreting salicylic and citric acids, mycobactins, and exochelins (5). IRON DEFICIENCY, SUPPLEMENTATION, AND IMMUNE FUNCTION Studies of iron deficiency and immune function in vivo are frequently confounded by coexisting nutritional deficiencies, poor socioeconomic conditions, and differing diagnostic criteria, which make them difficult to interpret and compare. Twenty-eight percent of 153 Peruvian infants had elevated C-reactive protein concentrations or leucocytosis associated with elevated ferritin concentrations, resulting in an underestimation of iron deficiency by 12% (6). Impaired T-cell proliferation, impaired delayed-type hypersensitivity, and decreased bactericidal activity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes have been consistently reported in iron deficiency (7). Neutrophils and macrophages require iron for phagocytosis and for generation of toxic oxygen intermediates to kill bacteria. Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction and hydrogen peroxide production are decreased in neutrophils and macrophages, respectively, if they become iron deficient (8). In contrast, exposure of neutrophils to excessive iron decreases phagocytosis, possibly because of increased free-radical production and consequent lipid-peroxidation damage of the phagosome membrane (9). Activated lymphocytes require iron to proliferate during the immune response (10). The DNA synthetic enzyme ribonucleotide reductase is iron dependent (11). However lymphocyte proliferation also decreases when transferrin saturation reaches 100% (12). Although iron deficiency is associated with an immune defect in vitro, studies of the effect of iron supplementation on morbidity from infection have often been contradictory and offer little evidence for benefit. Observational evidence that iron supplementation leads to increased morbidity or mortality from infection has been reported. Low transferrin levels were associated with increased risk of death in septic children with kwashiorkor who were given supplemental oral iron (the dosage regimen is unclear) (13), and it was proposed that administering iron to these children before transferrin concentrations had time to recover may have led to dangerously high levels of free iron in the circulation. Prophylactic intramuscular injections of iron dextran to a population of Polynesian newborns in New Zealand caused increased Gram-negative neonatal sepsis that decreased after stopping supplementation (14), and adult iron-deficient Somali nomads given 900 mg of ferrous sulphate for 30 days had increased episodes of infection compared with controls (15). Chronically iron-overloaded patients, such as those with hemochromatosis, chronic renal failure, or hereditary hemolytic anemia, who require repeated blood transfusions provide further insights. Phagocytic function (16) was impaired in patients undergoing hemodialysis, as was natural killer cell function in patients with thalassemia (17). The iron chelator desferrioxamine could reverse both effects. However, in a large multicenter study of 988 adult patients undergoing hemodialysis and monitored for 6 months, serum ferritin concentrations and iron treatment were not found to be risk factors for infection (18). Iron-overloaded patients are susceptible to infection with Yersinia, a bacterium that does not produce iron-binding chelators and is more likely to be invasive in the presence of free iron (19). A large body of clinical and laboratory data suggests that although iron is essential for immune function and that an immune defect is associated with iron deficiency, supplementation with iron does not decrease infectious disease morbidity and mortality and may even increase it in certain circumstances. ZINC AND THE ACUTE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE Zinc is predominately (95%) found in muscle, bone, skin, and hair. Only 5% is labile and accessible in the liver and plasma. Plasma zinc is 99% bound to albumin (80%), α-2 macroglobulin (15%), and other low-molecular-weight proteins. Metallothioneins are a group of intracellular monomeric polypeptides that bind zinc and act as homeostatic modulators of zinc availability. Serum concentrations of zinc decrease sharply in inflammation. Two doses of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide caused an increase in IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α associated with decreased serum zinc concentrations in adult volunteers; cytokine-directed internal redistribution of zinc was proposed (20). This hypozincemic response is accounted for largely by redistribution to the liver and reticuloendothelial system and may favor the immune system in producing acute-phase proteins (21). Calprotectin, an acute-phase zinc-binding protein produced by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes may play a role in sequestering extracellular zinc away from invading microorganisms (22). Adding zinc reversed calprotectin-inhibited growth of Candida albicans. Lower serum concentrations of zinc in inflammation and infection may reflect a natural protective mechanism, because lower concentrations of zinc are associated with optimal phagocytic function and decreased microbial virulence (23). Optimal phagocytosis of latex particles correlates with decreased concentrations of zinc in human serum and polymorphonuclear cells (24). Zinc is important in microbial virulence, and near physiologic concentrations of zinc are necessary for toxin production by Clostridium perfringens (25) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26). ZINC DEFICIENCY, SUPPLEMENTATION, AND IMMUNE FUNCTION Zinc plays a central role in the immune system, and deficiency affects immune function at many levels, both innate and specific. Deficiency is associated with a down-regulation of basic biologic functions at the cellular level, including DNA synthesis, RNA transcription, and cell division and activation. Cell-mediated immunity is profoundly affected in zinc deficiency. Lymphopenia, lymphoid atrophy, defects in specific T- and B-lymphocyte function, and impaired phagocytosis have all been described (27). Zinc deficiency rarely occurs alone and has no pathognomonic clinical features. Zinc supplementation of malnourished children improves immune function. Initial observations included enlargement of thymic shadows in children with marasmus who were given 10 days of zinc supplementation (28). Children with marasmus who were given supplemental zinc for 105 days had significantly increased conversion of delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions, enhanced lymphoproliferative response to phytohemagluttin, and increased salivary immunoglobulin A concentrations compared with nonsupplemented infants (29). Zinc supplementation of malnourished Ecuadorian children with 10 mg/d for 60 days was associated with significantly larger delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions than those of controls and significantly decreased incidence of fever, cough, and upper respiratory tract secretions (30). One dose of 20 mg zinc to Indian children with acute diarrhea resulted in significant decreases in the duration and severity of diarrhea (31), and supplementation of 10 mg/d 6 days each week for 6 months to rural, Ethiopian children with stunted growth resulted in significantly decreased infectious disease morbidity (32). Supplementation of zinc increases plasma concentrations to differing extents. In vitro evidence points to the free zinc ion concentration of the culture medium relative to the protein concentration as a determinant of effects on monocytes and lymphocytes (33). In cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, excess zinc (0.25 mmol/L) induced the release of IL-1β and IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (34). Paradoxically, although zinc-induced monokines stimulated T-cell proliferation, higher concentrations of zinc inhibited IL-1–dependent T-cell stimulation (35). Different leukocyte subtypes respond differently to similar zinc concentrations. Granulocyte phagocytosis was impaired by zinc in the presence of Mg2+ in a concentration-dependant manner (36). In animal experiments, supplemental zinc increased serum concentrations and was associated with decreased mobilization of polymorphonuclear cells and macrophages into the peritoneal cavity and with reduced phagocytosis (37). In adult men, administration of 150 mg of elemental zinc twice a week for 6 weeks was associated with decreased lymphocyte stimulation responses to phytohemagglutinin and with decreased chemotaxis and phagocytosis of bacteria by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (38). Zinc supplementation during sepsis has caused clinical problems, particularly in the presence of a compromised immune system. Infants with marasmus who were fed a zinc-fortified liquid diet (15 mg/L) had decreased phagocytic and fungicidal monocytic activity and significantly increased number and duration of episodes of impetigo (39). High-dose zinc supplementation (6 mg/kg daily) given early in rehabilitation to severely malnourished Bangladeshi children led to increased sepsis and mortality compared with low-dose supplementation (1.5 mg/kg daily) (40). Figure 1 shows the effect of 15 days of zinc supplementation and concurrent infection on plasma zinc concentrations in these children. On day 15, the high-dose zinc group had plasma zinc concentrations in the presence of infection that were equivalent to those of the low-dose zinc group free of infection. This study highlighted the difficulties in assessing the zinc requirements of the severely malnourished child; the wide variability in dosage regimens currently used, that is "physiologic" versus "pharmacologic" supplementation; and the detrimental effects of inappropriate dosage regimens.FIG. 1.: Mean plasma zinc concentrations (μmol/L) on days 1 and 15 for 141 severely malnourished Bangladeshi children, aged 6 to 36 months, given either 1.5 or 6.0 mg/kg daily zinc in the absence or presence of infection. C-reactive protein concentrations greater than 10 mg/dL were deemed indicative of infection.Zinc is essential to immune function, and its deficiency is associated with an immune defect. However, although zinc supplementation of zinc-deficient children has successfully decreased infectious disease morbidity, clinical and laboratory data indicate potential detrimental effects in certain groups. MECHANISMS OF FLUX AND COMPETITION Micronutrient flux and transport across cell membranes are prominent during inflammation. The cellular mechanisms that maintain the micronutrient environment and those underlying host/microbe competition for divalent cations are beginning to be characterized. Micronutrient gene interactions and direct effects of inflammatory mediators on micronutrient metabolism have been described and offer further insights into the homeostatic mechanisms of micronutrient metabolism and the effects of infection and inflammation. Zinc promotes mRNA stability and thus regulates gene expression (41). Zinc stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells also induces tumor necrosis factor-α mRNA transcription (42). Tumor necrosis factor-α increases ferritin synthesis (43) and IL-1 increases the expression of metallothionein 1 and 2 in the liver, bone marrow, and thymus, which accompanies the increased uptake of zinc in these organs (44). The identification of specific genetic polymorphisms that determine infectious disease susceptibility suggests that genes controlling micronutrient flux may explain some of the variability of response to supplementation. For instance, the methods by which macrophages compete with intracellular microbes for divalent cations recently have been identified. Natural resistance–associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) expression determines mouse susceptibility to Leishmania donovani, Salmonella typhimurium, Mycobacterium bovis, and lepraemurium infection. Expressed exclusively on the phagosome membrane of macrophages, this phosphoglycoprotein modulates growth of these diverse intracellular microbes by altering the intravacuolar microenvironment in which they grow. Divalent cation transporter 1 (DCT1), a rat homologue of NRAMP, has been shown to be a divalent cation transporter of iron, zinc, copper, and manganese in Xenopus oocytes (45). A mycobacterial NRAMP homologue, MRAMP mRNA, induced a pH-dependant 20-fold increase in zinc and iron uptake when injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes (46). Divalent cations are essential for microbial survival as cofactors for both superoxide dismutase and catalase redox enzymes, which neutralize the reactive oxygen intermediates integral to phagosomal killing, and for enzymes required for DNA synthesis. Infection with mycobacteria results in their residence within the phagolysosome of the macrophage. The phagolysosome matures and becomes increasingly acidic, allowing the host's killing systems to operate. However Mycobacterium tuberculosis arrests this maturation. The NRAMP1 is recruited early to the membrane of the phagolysosome and may modulate the divalent cation concentration of the phagolysosome, inhibiting growth of the parasite. In response, the Mycobacterium uses its own NRAMP homologues to compete for these cations. Substitution of glycine with aspartic acid at position 169 of the fourth transmembrane domain of NRAMP1 is associated with mycobacterial survival and growth within macrophages (47). Adding iron to macrophages from BCG susceptible mice (expressing the aspartic acid substitution in NRAMP 1) stimulated mycobacterial growth, whereas addition of low levels of iron to BCG-resistant mice macrophages inhibited growth (Fig 2) (48). However, adding hydroxyl radical scavengers abrogated this latter effect.FIG. 2.: Effect of iron on the growth of Mycobacterium avium in macrophages from BCG resistant (BCGr) and susceptible (BCGs) mice. Reproduced with permission (48).Both NRAMP and MRAMP seem to use intraphagolysosomal protons to modulate intraphagolysosomal cation concentration, and the intraphagolysosomal pH of mycobacteria-infected macrophages may be crucial in determining which predominates. Other divalent cations also may be involved (Fig. 3).FIG. 3.: Divalent cation (x2+) competition between intraphagosomal mycobacteria (myc) and macrophage. Natural resistance–associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP) functions to modulate intraphagolysosomal cation concentration either by exporting them from the phagolysosome and depriving the mycobacteria (as seen here, Agranoff et al. (54), with permission) or by transporting them into the phagolysosome to catalyse hydroxyl radical production (45). The mycobacteria counters with a mycobacterial NRAMP homologue, MRAMP, and type 1 P-type adenosine diphosphatase transporting ions into the mycobacteria for use in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) reactive oxygen intermediate detoxification systems.Evidence is emerging that NRAMP1 is a predisposing factor in intracellular infections in humans. Susceptibility to leprosy in Vietnamese families was linked to the NRAMP1 gene (49), and polymorphic variants were also associated with susceptibility to Mycobacterial tuberculosis in a case control study in The Gambia, West Africa (50). CONCLUSIONS Divalent cation flux, around and within cells of the immune system, plays a critical role in their optimal function and defense against invading microbes. Iron and zinc deficiencies and excesses have been associated with immunomodulatory effects, and micronutrient supplementation has had beneficial and detrimental effects on immune function. Zinc supplementation of children who are zinc deficient improves immune function, whereas iron supplementation of iron-deficient children does not. There is no evidence that zinc supplements cause harm when given to nonseptic immunocompetent children. In general, the immune response to an iron or zinc supplement of a child who is uninfected but micronutrient deficient is predictable. However, many children targeted for supplementation have multiple micronutrient deficiencies, coexisting macronutrient malnutrition, and associated immunoincompetence, which may influence their response to supplementation. In the septic, severely malnourished or immunocompromised child, the immune response to supplementation is less predictable. Study of the relationship between iron and zinc supplementation and infection in these children highlights this and indicates factors influencing this variability. The fine balance between benefit and harm reflects the perilous nature of their immunocompromise, and an inappropriate micronutrient supplement may have adverse effects that are not likely to occur in the immunocompetent child. In a healthy, micronutrient-deficient child, the net effect of the supplement is beneficial, because a partially compromised immune system seems to benefit from micronutrient supplementation in the absence of competing microbes. In the septic, severely malnourished, or immunocompromised child, the competing microbes may benefit immediately and before the severely compromised immune system can use the supplement to aid recovery (Fig 4).FIG. 4.: Schematic representation of how the host/pathogen relationship of the septic, malnourished child is influenced by iron and zinc status, the acute inflammatory response (AIR), and host genome (resistance) and pathogen genome (virulence) factors. The effect of iron or zinc supplementation will depend on all these factors.Although this review has concentrated on the interaction between micronutrient supplements and infection, the dosage administered (41) and interactions between micronutrients may contribute to the variability of response. Zinc supplementation studies of malnourished children are striking in the diversity of supplementation regimens used, reflecting difficulties in accurately assessing the zinc status and requirements of these children. Micronutrients interact, and interactions among zinc, iron, and copper are well recognized (51,52). Inflammation and zinc supplementation can induce metallothionein synthesis, principally in the liver but also in other tissues. Metallothionein binds copper and zinc with different affinities, influencing absorption and bioavailability of both at a cellular level. A review of these interactions is beyond the scope of this paper, but the interactions certainly could influence response to supplementation. Zinc deficiency rarely occurs in isolation. The effect of a supplement given during an infection on the course of that infection may depend on the magnitude of the micronutrient deficiency, dose of the supplement, presence of other nutritional deficiencies and interactions with other micronutrients, level of immunocompromise, type and pathogenicity of infection, and genetic variability in divalent cation transport mechanisms. With increasing recognition of specific polymorphisms that influence micronutrient flux and with demonstration of their influence on susceptibility to tuberculosis and leprosy, predicting response to supplementation may improve. The NRAMP1 is localized exclusively to the phagolysomal membrane of the macrophage, and so far NRAMP1 has been shown to be important only in infections characterized by chronic intracellular residence. As mechanisms of divalent cation flux and competition are characterized, other polymorphisms in host and microbe may be shown to affect susceptibility to infection. Variability in response and potential detrimental effects must be considered in micronutrient supplementation strategies. Recognition and characterization of subgroups within populations that might not benefit from iron or zinc supplementation would be an important first step in better micronutrient targeting. These subgroups should include septic, severely malnourished, or immunocompromised children. The World Health Organization has recently advised on micronutrient supplementation regimens for severely malnourished children and warned that iron supplements should not be given in the initial phase of treatment (53). This warning should be extended to high-dose zinc supplements. Further research is urgently required into the benefits or otherwise of iron or zinc supplementation during sepsis, into the mechanisms of divalent cation transport, and into micronutrient gene interactions in host cells and microbes. Improved supplement targeting requires better understanding of the immune response to supplementation during infection and recognition that variability to response exists and is poorly understood.

N2  - Markovska O. Ye. different scenarios for irrigated agriculture and choice of the optimal combination of technological operations to save resource expenditures, obtain economically feasible levels of yields and solve environmental problems of agricultural production. Scientific bases and practical tools for modeling wateruse and crop yields in short crop rotations At the moment, there are many imitation crop productivity models that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of irrigation in crop rotations with different degrees of saturation with grain, industrial and other crops under biologically optimal and water-saving irrigation regimes, which will greatly improve the efficiency of irrigation water, fertilizers and pesticides use at the level of each field, crop rotation and farm.The imitative models of plant growth and development that can be created in the DSSAT and CROPWAT software complexes are of practical importance, however, none of these programs allows controlling soil fertility parameters, its ecological and meliorative conditions and optimize crop rotation on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the initial data.One of the strategic solutions to these problems was the development of the United Nations FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) Division of Land and Water Resources, a special software complex, AquaCrop, which is designed to simulate water and nutrient expenditures for the formation of programmed yield levels, to establish the optimal response and resource-saving irrigation by different biological parameters of crops, study the impact of meteorological factors on plant production processes, etc. 3 .This simple and reliable model has been successfully tested for many cereals, industrial and forage crops in different regions of the world (for example, barleyin Southern Sahara region of Africa, wheatin Iran and western provinces of Canada, forage cropsin Ethiopia, corn for grainin California (USA) et al.) 4, 5, 6, 7 .

N2  - Sorghum chafer, Pachnoda interrupta (Olivier) is a damaging pest of sorghum, other cereals and horticultural crops in Africa which results in complete crop loss. Currently, the management strategies rely heavily on chemical pesticides, which do not provide effective control. There is evidence showing that microbial biocontrol agents have the potential to control P. interrupta. In this study, the entomopathogenic fungi isolated from soils and insects in Ethiopia were identified using morphological and cultural characteristics. These were then evaluated for viability and virulence against Galleria mellonella (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae) larvae and P. interrupta adults. Firstly, 116 Metarhizium spp. and Beauveria spp. were considered. The isolates were evaluated based on high viability as measured by percentage germination on SDA media. Only 56 isolates had greater than 70% viability. Secondly, these were further evaluated using conidial suspensions applied to G. mellonella larvae at a concentration of 1×108conidia/ml. Four Beauveria spp. and three Metarhizium spp. isolates which caused over 60% mortality were selected for final virulence assay against adults of P. interrupta. The selected isolates were further confirmed by PCR amplification of ITS4 and ITS5 gene regions and chi1 and chi4 primers. Finally, the seven isolates were evaluated for virulence against P. interrupta at a dose of 1 mg dry conidia/10 beetles under laboratory condition. Mortality of P. interrupta ranged from 14% for isolate 9604 to 82% for isolate PPRC51. Dose-response tests showed that the LD50 of PPRC2 (0.62 mg/10 beetles) and PPRC51 (0.55 mg/10 beetles) isolates were not significantly different from each other. The results demonstrated the high potential of the two isolates (PPRC51 and PPRC2) as microbial biocontrol agents. However, field evaluation of the isolates should be performed for their development into a mycopesticide against P. interrupta. Key words: Pachnoda interrupta, Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana, bioassay, ITS4, ITS5.

N2  - This paper presented summary of recently findings on Moringa oleifera (Mo) role in livestock dietetics and community’s livelihoods in countries akin to Ethiopia. Relevant data were collected, analyzed, discussed, concluded and recommended. Therefore, Mo is known to be fast-growing and high biomass-yield, drought-resistant and multifarious potentials merited tropical forage-tree. Mo is said to be Panacea’ stores vital-nutrients, medicines and phytochemicals to treat more than 300 ailments of human being (Table 3), besides to nourish animals & humans as required level. Mo used to purify water; treat and fertilize soil, living fence, alley-cropping, natural-pesticides, domestic cleaning-agents, and fuel woods. However, Mo and similar forage trees resources have not been utilized to the scope mainly due to lack of awareness, and skills. Accordingly, dietary scarcity, increased medicine costs are most developmental and reemerging challenges in Ethiopia and region. However, favorable environment, huge water- and fertile land resources, increased higher institutions, and socio-economic income growth validated by global market-corridor could be the opportunities to utilize resources mainly in Ethiopia. Therefore, I conclude that this Article create better awareness, knowledge and skills for Mo tree to be utilized as potential means of dietetic, medication, climate change mitigation and commercial commodity; aimed to bridge the gap for livestock’s feeding public livelihoods.

N2  - Abstract Introduction : Anopheles arabiensis , member species of the Anopheles gambiae complex, is the primary vector of malaria widely distributed in Ethiopia. Anopheles funestus, An. pharoensis and An. nili are secondary vectors occurring with limited distribution in the country. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are pillars for the interventions against malaria control and elimination efforts in Ethiopia. However, the emergence and widespread of insecticide resistance in the major malaria vector, An. arabiensis , might compromise the efforts of the country. The aim of this study was to investigate composition of mosquito species and insecticide resistance status of An. arabiensis in Itang special woreda (district), Gambella, southwestern Ethiopia. Materials and methods : Adult mosquitoes were sampled from September 2020 to Feburary 2021 using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light trap and Pyrethrum Spray Catch (PSC). Moreover, mosquito larvae were also collected from different breeding sites and reared to adults to assess susceptibility status of populations of An. gambiae s.l. in the study area. Susceptibility tests were conducted on two to three days old non blood fed female An. gambiae s.l using insecticide impregnated papers with deltamethrin (0.05%), alpha-cypermethrin (0.05%), propoxur (0.1%), pirimiphos-methyl (0.25%) and bendiocarb (0.1%) following World Health Organization (WHO) standard susceptibility test procedure. Molecular diagnostics were done for the identification of member species of An. gambiae s.l and detection of knockdown resistance ( kdr ) allele using species specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and allele specific PCR. Results : In total, 468 adult mosquitoes were collected from different houses. Culex mosquitoes were the most dominant (80.4%) followed by Anopheles mosquitoes. Three species of Anopheles mosquitoes ( An. coustani, An. pharoensis , and An. gambiae (s.l.)) were identified, of which An. coustani was the dominant (8.1%) species. WHO bioassay tests revealed that the populations of An. gambiae s.l in the study area are resistant against alpha-cypermethrin and deltamethrin whereas, susceptible to bendiocarb, pirimiphos-methyl and propoxur. Out of the total 86 An. gambiae s.l specimens assayed, 79 (92%) successfully amplified and identified as An. arabiensis . West African Kdr (L1014F) mutation was detected with high Kdr allele frequency ranging from 67-88%. Conclusion: The detection of target site mutation, kdr L1014F allele, coupled with the phenotypic resistance against alpha-cypermethrin and deltamethrin call for continuous resistance monitoring.

N2  - This study was conducted to assess the presence of pesticides residues in wheat from Misha woreda, Haiya Zone, Ethiopia. Samples of wheat were collected during the period December 2015 to August 2016. Gas chromatograph (GC-MS) detection was employed after Liquid-Liquid extraction (LLE). The concentration levels of eight pesticides have been investigated in both wheat samples in farm and purchased from storage facilities. Since the method was out of scope, it was validated before application to the analysis of these pesticides. The spiked recovery results for five analytes were within the acceptable international standard. The LOD value and LOQ value are below the LCC and MRL of the analyte. Method validation for this study maintained a RSD <20% and percentage recoveries were in the range of 80-110%. The %RSD of all detected analytes was less than the acceptable international standard. Results show that out of the residues of eight analytes determined, four analytes (2,4-D; aldrin; Endosulfan; p,p-DDT) were detected in both field (pre harvest) samples and stored (post harvested) sample, whereas the remaining analytes were not detected at all. In general, the concentrations of these analytes in the wheat samples are in the order: 2, 4-D >aldrin>p,p-DDT >Endosulfan. The study observed that from the detected analytes, none of them are above the international MRL values and suggested that stringent monitoring of use of pesticides in agriculture and food storage is required.

N2  - So-called 'neglected tropical diseases' (NTDs) are becoming less neglected, with increasing political and financial commitments to their control. These recent developments were preceded by substantial advocacy for integrated control of different NTDs, on the premise that integration is both feasible and cost-effective. Although the approach is intuitively attractive, there are few countrywide experiences to confirm or refute this assertion. Using the example of Uganda, this article reviews the geographical and epidemiological bases for integration and assesses the potential opportunities for, and operational challenges of, integrating existing control activities for several of these diseases under an umbrella vertical programme. So-called 'neglected tropical diseases' (NTDs) are becoming less neglected, with increasing political and financial commitments to their control. These recent developments were preceded by substantial advocacy for integrated control of different NTDs, on the premise that integration is both feasible and cost-effective.

Using the example of Uganda, this article reviews the geographical and epidemiological bases for integration and assesses the potential opportunities for, and operational challenges of, integrating existing control activities for several of these diseases under an umbrella vertical programme. Potential for integrationGreater emphasis is being given to controlling neglected tropical diseases [NTDs; Neglected tropical diseases, hidden successes, emerging opportunities (http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2006/WHO_CDS_NTD_2006.2_eng.pdf)]. The term 'NTDs' is used because they exclusively affect the poor and marginalized in low-income countries and, until recently, received little or no advocacy or funding. The most important African NTDs are shown in Table 1. Although these diseases are thought to kill up to 500 000 people per year [1Hotez P. et al.The neglected tropical diseases: the ancient afflictions of stigma and poverty and the prospects for their control and elimination.in: Pollard A.J. Finn A. Hot Topics in Infection and Immunity in Children III. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, 2006: 23-33Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar], mortality figures alone do not capture the main impact of NTDs on public health, which largely arises from chronic disability and morbidity [2Engels D. Savioli L. Reconsidering the underestimated burden caused by neglected tropical diseases.Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 363-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar]. In an effort to control or eliminate this disease burden, several global vertical initiatives have been established [3Molyneux D.H. Control of human parasitic diseases: Context and overview.Adv. Parasitol. 2006; 61: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar]. Since 2004, there has been greater advocacy for the logistical and economic benefits of integrated control of NTDs, whereby different treatment strategies are bundled together [4Molyneux D. et al.'Rapid-impact interventions': how a policy of integrated control for Africa's neglected tropical diseases could benefit the poor.PLoS Med. 2005; 2: e336Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 5Hotez P.J. et al.Incorporating a rapid-impact package for neglected tropical diseases with programs for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.PLoS Med. 2006; 3: e102Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 6Brady M.A. et al.Projected benefits from integrating NTD programs in sub-Saharan Africa.Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 285-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar]. Integration can also involve another aspect: linking intervention packages with ongoing healthcare delivery [7Unger J.-P. et al.A code of best practice for disease control programmes to avoid damaging health care services in developing countries.Int.

For example, in Nigeria, integrated distribution of anthelmintic treatments combined with insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) by community-based volunteers resulted in increased uptake of ITNs without an adverse effect on the coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) [8Blackburn B.G. et al.Successful integration of insecticide-treated bed net distribution with mass drug administration in Central Nigeria.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2006; 75: 650-655PubMed Google Scholar]. To help support national programmes, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently published guidelines on integrated helminthiasis control, which have been designed to deal with drugs and their coordinated use in all epidemiological situations, including those in which there is limited geographical overlap [Preventive chemotherapy in human helminthiasis (http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2006/9241547103_eng.pdf)]. In addition, the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Disease Control was launched in October 2006, with the aim of providing advocacy and coordinating the efforts of NTD-control partners [9Anonymous US AIDS coordinator shuns collaboration on neglected diseases.Lancet. 2006; 386: 1547Google Scholar]. However, although the concept of integration is logistically and economically appealing, experience at the country level is surprisingly limited.Similar to many other developing countries, Uganda is affected by a high burden of NTDs: visceral leishmaniasis (VL; kala-azar) [10Kolaczinski J. et al.Kala-azar control in Uganda: Present state, future prospects.Emerg.

It also implements a broader integrated health package through the Child Health Days (CHDs) instigated by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and is one of five African 'fast-track' countries that receives support from the US Agency for International Development (USAID), to develop an integrated NTD control programme [RTI launches integrated program to address neglected tropical diseases (http://www.rti.org/newsroom)]. Implementation of such a package necessitates careful consideration of several issues, including the geography, epidemiology and ecology of different NTDs, in addition to the advantages and disadvantages of existing control strategies.Table 2NTDs in UgandaDiseaseDistributionaThe number of districts quoted here and elsewhere in the document refers to the number prior to recent administrative changes that have divided some of the previous districts.Nationwide burdenRefsA. lumbricoides and T. trichiuraUnevenly distributed; the highest prevalence is in southwest UgandaAverage prevalence of <10%, but >50% in southwest Uganda14Kabatereine N.B. et al.Soil-transmitted helminthiasis in Uganda: epidemiology and cost of control.Trop.

Open table in a new tab Geography of integrated controlUnderstanding which geographical areas require intervention is fundamental for cost-effective disease control. NTDs in Uganda have been mapped using a variety of survey methodologies. The distribution of onchoceriasis has been estimated using the rapid epidemiological mapping of onchoceriasis (REMO) method [20Katabarwa M. et al.Rapid epidemiological mapping of onchocerciasis in areas of Uganda where Simulium neavei s.l. is the vector.East Afr. Med. J. 1999; 76: 440-446PubMed Google Scholar], enabling communities to be classified into three categories: priority areas requiring community-directed drug treatment with ivermectin (CDTI); areas not requiring treatment; and possible endemic areas requiring further investigation [17Ndyomugyenyi R. The burden of onchocerciasis in Uganda.Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1998; 92: S133-S137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar]. Rapid mapping of LF included school surveys using immunochromatographic antigenic detection cards and the application of geostatistical methods to create a nationwide estimation of the prevalence of LF [16Onapa A.W. et al.Rapid assessment of the geographical distribution of lymphatic filariasis in Uganda, by screening of schoolchildren for circulating filarial antigens.Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 2005; 99: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar]. The distributions of schistosomiasis and STH infections were defined according to nationwide parasitological surveys [14Kabatereine N.B. et al.Soil-transmitted helminthiasis in Uganda: epidemiology and cost of control.Trop. Med. Int. Health. 2005; 10: 1187-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Kabatereine N.B. et al.Epidemiology and geography of Schistosoma mansoni in Uganda: implications for planning control.Trop. Med. Int. Health. 2004; 9: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar]. More recently, rapid mapping of schistosomiasis used lot quality-assurance sampling (LQAS) to finely target control [21Brooker S. et al.Rapid assessment of Schistosoma mansoni: the validity, application and cost-effectiveness of the Lot Quality Assurance Sampling method in Uganda.Trop. Med. Int. Health. 2005; 10: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar]. LQAS has also been used to estimate the prevalence of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis in northern Uganda, enabling communities to be ranked according to prevalence categories [22Hutin Y.J. et al.Trypanosoma brucei gambiense trypanosomiasis in Terego county, northern Uganda, 1996: a lot quality assurance sampling survey.Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2004; 70: 390-394PubMed Google Scholar]. Elsewhere, distributions of HAT have been assessed using expensive case detection by passive or population mass screening: T. b. gambiense occurs in northwestern Uganda, whereas Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense has traditionally occurred in southeastern areas [23Fèvre E.M. et al.Human African trypanosomiasis: epidemiology and control.Adv. Parasitol. 2006; 61: 167-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar]. These two foci are currently geographically separated but are becoming worryingly close [11Fèvre E.M. et al.A burgeoning epidemic of sleeping sickness in Uganda.Lancet. 2005; 366: 745-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Fèvre E.M. The origins of a new Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense sleeping sickness outbreak in eastern Uganda.Lancet. 2001; 358: 625-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar]. The endemicity of VL has, so far, been defined only on the basis of passive case-detection data, which suggest that the disease is restricted to Pokot county, a semiarid lowland area in the Nakapiripirit district [10Kolaczinski J. et al.Kala-azar control in Uganda: Present state, future prospects.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2007; 13: 507-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar]; however, there are concerns that VL might be endemic over a larger area. Trachoma is thought to be endemic in at least 26 districts, putting ∼7 million people at risk. A nationwide survey is planned, to provide detailed data on the distribution and burden of trachoma.On the basis of these geographical assessments, it is possible to qualitatively define the codistribution of different NTDs (Figure 1). Existing data indicate that onchocerciasis, schistosomiasis and LF are coendemic in ten districts of northwestern Uganda, putting >500 000 people at risk of coacquiring them. LF is coendemic with schistosomiasis in at least 19 districts and with onchocerciasis in at least 13 districts. Further surveys are required to confirm whether coendemicity applies to whole districts or is more localized.Epidemiology and ecology of integrated controlControl of different NTDs must be based on a detailed understanding of their epidemiologies and modes of parasite transmission. The target age-groups might differ between NTDs [4Molyneux D. et al.'Rapid-impact interventions': how a policy of integrated control for Africa's neglected tropical diseases could benefit the poor.PLoS Med. 2005; 2: e336Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar]. The prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis and STHs (except hookworm) are greatest among school-age children or young adults and decrease throughout adulthood [15Kabatereine N.B. et al.Epidemiology and geography of Schistosoma mansoni in Uganda: implications for planning control.Trop. Med. Int. Health. 2004; 9: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25Bundy D.A. Medley G. Immuno-epidemiology of human geohelminthiasis: ecological and immunological determinants of worm burden.Parasitology. 1992; 104: S105-S119Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar], whereas for LF and hookworm age-specific prevalence rises throughout childhood and attains a stable asymptote, or rises marginally, in adulthood [26Onapa A.W. et al.Lymphatic filariasis in Uganda: baseline investigations in Lira, Soroti and Katakwi districts.Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2001; 95: 161-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Witt C. Ottesen A. Lymphatic filariasis: an infection of childhood.Trop. Med. Int. Health. 2001; 6: 582-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 28Brooker S. et al.Human hookworm infection in the 21st century.Adv. Parasitol. 2004; 58: 197-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar]. Epidemiological patterns of onchocerciasis vary markedly between geographical zones [29Remme J. et al.Tropical diseases targeted for elimination: Chagas disease, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and leprosy.in: Jamison T. Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries. 2nd edn. Oxford University Press and the World Bank, 2006: 433-449Google Scholar]; in Uganda, the prevalence of infection increases throughout childhood and reaches a plateau at 20 years, whereas the occurrence of nodules and onchocercal dermatitis increases throughout childhood and adulthood [30Kipp W. et al.Onchocerciasis prevalence in previously known foci in western Uganda: results from a preliminary survey in Kabarole district.Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1992; 43: 80-82PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fischer P. et al.Parasitological and clinical characterization of Simulium neavei-transmitted onchocerciasis in western Uganda.Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1993; 44: 311-321PubMed Google Scholar]. Thus, school-age children are the natural targets for population-based treatment of STHs and schistosomiasis, whereas communitywide treatment is warranted for LF and onchocerciasis.LF and onchocerciasis are vector-borne diseases, transmitted by several genera of mosquitoes and blackflies of the Simulium genus, respectively. Vector control has been highly effective in the control of onchocerciasis [32Davies J.B. Sixty years of onchocerciasis vector control: A chronological summary with comments on eradication, reinvasion, and insecticide resistance.Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1994; 39: 23-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar], for which the stated goal is interruption of transmission, and might potentially have a significant role in elimination of LF [33Burkot T.R. et al.The argument for integrating vector control with multiple drug administration campaigns to ensure elimination of lymphatic filariasis.Filaria J. 2006; 5: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar]. In both cases, communities within whole districts should be targeted with interventions [34Boatin B. Richards F. Control of onchocerciasis.Adv. Parasitol. 2006; 61: 349-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 35Ottesen E. Lymphatic filariasis: treatment, control and elimination.Adv. Parasitol. 2006; 61: 395-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar]. Transmission of STHs and schistosomiasis depends on contamination of soil and snail-infested water with human faeces and urine, hindering elimination in settings with inadequate water supply and sanitation. Consequently, the goal of schistosomiasis and STH control is the reduction of morbidity, hence interventions typically target age-groups with the greatest morbidity, namely school-age children and young adults in high-prevalence communities or subdistricts [36Savioli L. et al.Schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths infections: forging control efforts.Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2002; 96: 577-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 37Fenwick A. et al.Implementation of human schistosomiasis control: challenges and prospects.Adv. Parasitol. 2006; 61: 567-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar]. These different treatment goals and intervention units require consideration in the design of integrated treatment programmes for NTDs.HAT is transmitted by tsetse flies and occurs more often in adults [38Odiit M. et al.Spatial and temporal risk factors for the early detection of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense sleeping sickness patients in Tororo and Busia districts, Uganda.Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2004; 98: 569-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar], whereas VL is transmitted by sandflies and, at least in Uganda, is most common in children and teenagers [10Kolaczinski J. et al.Kala-azar control in Uganda: Present state, future prospects.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2007; 13: 507-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. Vector control can make an important contribution to reducing the burden of both diseases [39Barrett M. et al.The trypanosomiases.Lancet. 2003; 362: 1469-1480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 40Killick-Kendrick R.

Res. 2006; 123: 467-472PubMed Google Scholar], but it is rarely implemented because of a lack of financial resources. Treatment is lengthy, expensive and relatively toxic. Development of new drugs and adequate diagnostic tools has been slow [42Cattand P. et al.Tropical diseases lacking adequate control measures: dengue, leishmaniasis, and African trypanosomiasis.in: Jamison T. Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries. 2nd edn. Oxford University Press and the World Bank, 2006: 451-466Google Scholar, 43Torreele E. et al.To fully tackle the gang of four, needs-driven R & D is essential.PLoS Med. 2006; 6: e282Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar], although a reliable rapid diagnostic test for VL is now available [44Chappuis F. et al.A meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of the direct agglutination test and rK39 dipstick for visceral leishmaniasis.BMJ. 2006; 333: 723Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar].Current control of neglected tropical diseases in UgandaThe control of most NTDs is the mandate of the Vector Control Division (VCD) of the Ugandan MoH. The VCD was established in the early 1920s and led national vector-borne disease control until the 1970s, when it virtually collapsed during military rule, only being rehabilitated in 1994 [45Dunne D.W. et al.Applied and basic research on the epidemiology, morbidity, and immunology of schistosomiasis in fishing communities on Lake Albert, Uganda.Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2006; 100: 216-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar].The longest-running control programme in the VCD is the national onchocerciasis control programme, established in 1992. Since the mid-1990s, it has been supported by the Carter Centre's Global 2000 River Blindness Programme, Sight Savers International, the Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit and the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control. Intervention consists of annual CDTI, supplemented by vector control in isolated foci of Simulium neavei[46Ndyomugyenyi R. et al.The impact of ivermectin treatment alone and when in parallel with Simulium neavei elimination on onchocerciasis in Uganda.Trop. Med. Int. Health. 2004; 9: 882-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 47Ndyomugyenyi R. et al.Progress towards the elimination of onchocerciasis as a public-health problem in Uganda: opportunities, challenges and the way forward.Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 2007; 101: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar]. To date, geographical treatment coverage has reached 100% and therapeutic coverage remains stable at 80%. Large-scale vector control is unfeasible because the breeding sites are too widespread or inaccessible and extend into politically unstable countries, such as the Democratic Republic of C

N2  - The study sought to ascertain spider mite prevalence, infestation, and identification and to assess the response of potato genotypes. In 2022, this pest was only observed on some genotypes in December. In late January, an infestation, incidence, and severity increased from 10 to 13 genotypes on potato tuber stocks stored for irrigation experiments. Those genotypes were planted in irrigated fields, and the sprouted tuber losses ranged from 12.5% to 100% and up to 15.38% in the 2022 and 2023 records, respectively. Following this, spider mites, often known as two-spotted spider mites (TSSM) or Tetranychus urticae, were identified. This is the first time a potato sprout infestation has been recorded in Ethiopia. The two-spotted spider mites damaged the tubers quantitatively by sucking the moisture of sprouts up to the 5th grade, with 97 and &gt;75% infestation levels, incidence, and severity, respectively. The pest grows very rapidly and hastens the drying of sprouted tuber leaves. Some genotypes were resistant to TSSM and recovered after the sprouts were infected and dried, which were treated with pesticides in 2023. The typical agricultural insecticides were ineffective in controlling the pest in the first year, and a Profenofos was applied in the second year. Thus, seed tubers are the main production limit unless appropriate research efforts are undertaken and management techniques are created. Int. J. Agril. Res. Innov. Tech. 13(2): 55-63, Dec 2023

N2  - Agriculture is a critical source of food and income, making it a key component of poverty reduction and ensuring food security across the globe.The sector generates 88.8 percent of the trade profit and contributes 36.7 percent of GDP.The purpose of this paper is to identify the homogeneous and heterogeneous effects of agricultural inputs on crop productivity of three-grain crop types in Ethiopia using an appropriate PMG estimator, as well as to evaluate the effect of agricultural input heterogeneity and homogeneity across individual cross-sectional units (crops).The central statistical agency (CSA) provided the data for this study, which covered the entire country from 1990 to 2012 Ethiopian Calendar (E.C).In the long run, the study found that a one percent increase in fertilizer use resulted in a 2.686 percent increase in productivity of grain crops in Ethiopia, while a corresponding increase in improved seed per hectare and land size resulted in a 48.31 percent and 10.58 percent increase in productivity of grain crops per crop type, respectively.As the value of improved seed increased by one percent with a period lag among commercial farmers, the short-term production of cereal crops increased by 30.29 percent.Grain crop productivity improved by 40.6 percent when area increased by one percent at the first difference.The results of this study show that fertilizer use, improved seed use, and cropland size made homogeneous significant contributions to improved grain crop productivity in the long run across all cross-sectional units.However, in the short run, agricultural inputs such as pesticide use and improved seed use made heterogeneous significant contributions to the first lagged value.

N2  - Catha edulis of the plant family Celastraceae commonly named as Khat in Ethiopia is a stimulant plant containing amphetamine-like substances.Fresh Khat leaves described to contain some 60 different constituents.Consumers chew leaves and masticate it for hours.Some users make a paste from dried leaf powder, mixing with sugar and water which is easily chewed and swallowed.In some areas, dried leaves are used as a tea, and also crushed and rolled into cigarettes.Less attention has been directed toward possible chemical and microbial contamination and risky pathways.The aims of this study are 1.Identify the actual Khat production-consumption process from farm to use. 2. Detect chemical and microbial contamination risk of consumable Khat leaf in process 3. Assess the microbiological qualities chewable Khat leaf.Descriptive statistics from the main dataset, for Khat consumption, showed that out of 1169, 564 household heads were Khat consumers and out of these consumers, 347 (62.52%) consume daily.Majority of the pilot study participants (retailers and consumers) confirmed that pesticide chemicals are sprayed on Khat bushes and trees, and Khat farmers disclosed the use of Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and Malathion on their farm.The mean CFU/gm was 1.69*10^5 which indicate poor hygiene /handling.Our observation showed that the processes from farming, Transporting, collection, distribution (whole-sellers, retailers) to consumption indicate a potential risk for Khat leaf to become contaminated with Chemicals/ microorganisms.

N2  - A field experiment was undertaken to determine optimum combination of weed management practices and inter-row spacing levels for effective weed control in maize at Bako agricultural research center, Western Oromia, Ethiopia during 2018 main cropping season. The treatments included pre-emergence s-metolachlor 290 g/L + atrazine 370 g/L (1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 L ha-1), hand pulling and hoeing 25 and 45 days after sowing (DAS) and weedy check in combination with inter-row spacing levels (65, 70, 75, and 80 cm). The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with a factorial arrangement in three replications. The experimental field was infested with 22 weed species belonging to 12 families, out of which 77.3 %, 18.2 % and 4.5 % were broad leaved, grass and sedges, respectively. Weed management practices (WMP), inter-row spacing (IRS) and their interaction significantly influenced the weed density, dry weight and weed control efficiency at 25 and 70 DAS. All parameters of the crop were significantly affected by WMP and IRS. However, their interaction was non-significant except for number of ear per plant and grain yield. The highest grain yield was recorded in inter-row spacing of 65 cm treated with hand pulling and hoeing 25 and 45 DAS (10492.0 kg ha-1). Whereas, the lowest grain yield (2237.0 kg ha-1) was obtained from weedy check plot at 80 cm inter-row spacing. On the other hand, maize planted at 65 cm IRS in combination with 2 L ha-1 s-metolachlor 290g/L + atrazine 370 g/L gave comparable grain yield which was statistically at par with that of hand pulling and hoeing 25 and 45 DAS and 3 L ha-1 s-metolachlor 290g/l. + atrazine 370 g/L involving the same IRS. Hence, putting the environmental concern and scarce labor force under consideration, the use of reduced rate (2 L ha-1) of herbicide in combination with narrower IRS would be the best option for effective weed management in maize. Furthermore, integration of narrower IRS with other weed management treatments enhance maize grain yield there by improving weed control efficiency.

N2  - Tomato powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica) is a common disease of tomato crops in Ethiopia. To control the disease, application of fungicide Microthiol Disperss (Sulfur 80%) was tested under natural field condition at Debre Zeit Agricultural Research Center and the standard check Thiovet Jet 80 WP (Sulfur) on Galiea tomato variety to assess the efficacy. The rate was 2–4 kg/ha diluted with 400 L of water/ha of land. Result of experiment showed that Microthiol Disperss (Sulfur 80%) effective Powdery Mildew tomato to get good fruit quantity and qualities with no significant difference Thiovet Jet 80 WP under natural field condition. Microthiol Disperss (Sulfur 80%) has gave 16.65 t/ha of yield at a rate of 2–4 kg/ha provided comparable yield as Thiovet Jet 80 WP (Sulfur) of 12.41 t/ha with no significance difference. Therefore, Microthiol Disperss at a rate of 2–4 kg/ha is diluted with 400 L/ha of water is recommended to be used as alternative fungicide for prevention and control of Powdery Mildew integrated with other environmentally safe powdery mildew management practices on tomato cultivated depending on disease pressure, agroecology, and susceptible variety. Moreover, it also used to as preventive fungicide for powdery mildew on tomato in early occurrence of the disease.

N2  - Milk is a highly nutritious food, and it is a source of necessary macro and micro-nutrients for the growth, development and maintenance of human health. However the quality and safety of milk and dairy products become major health concern for consumers particularly to infants and children. This paper attempts to review the state of knowledge on nutritional quality, chemical contaminants and adulterants of milk and dairy products in Ethiopia. It also focuses on the method for analysis and identifies gaps for future work. Some work has been done in nutritional quality of milk and dairy products. The nutritional quality of Ethiopian milk products are substandard due to poor hygienic practices and water adulteration at farm level and value chain actors. Few of the research results reviewed for aflatoxin M<sub>1</sub>, organochlorine pesticide, heavy metals and antibiotic residues exceed international maximum permissible limit standards. The use of adulterants for economic gain is adding of water (dilution) in raw milk. In general there are limited reports in chemical contaminants in the country. Further research is required on quantification, implementation of monitoring and controlling system to improve the quality and safety of milk products across value chain in the regions of the country.

Wagstaff, van Doorslaer, and Watanabe propose a method for decomposing inequalities in the health sector into their causes, by coupling the concentration index with a regression framework. They also show how changes in inequality over time, and differences across countries, can be decomposed into the following: • Changes due to changing inequalities in the determinants of the variable of interest. • Changes in the means of the determinants. • Changes in the effects of the determinants on the variable of interest. The authors illustrate the method using data on child malnutrition in Vietnam. They find that inequalities in height-for-age in 1993 and 1998 are accounted for largely by inequalities in household consumption and by unobserved influences at the commune level. And they find that an increase in such inequalities is accounted for largely by changes in these two influences. In the case of household consumption, rising inequalities play a part, but more important have been the inequality-increasing effects of rising average consumption and the increased protective effect of consumption on nutritional status. In the case of unobserved commune-level influences, rising inequality and general improvements seem to have been roughly equally important in accounting for rising inequality in malnutrition. This paper--a joint product of Public Services for Human Development, Development Research Group, and the Development Data Group--is part of a larger effort in the Bank to investigate the links between health and poverty.

N2  - Chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i> L.) is the world’s second most important grain legumes after common bean (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L.) among food legumes grown for production worldwide. Ethiopia is considered as secondary center of genetic diversity for chickpea. Field experiment was conducted at two districts with the objectives to demonstrate different insecticide for the control of pod borer on chickpea and to give awareness on the use and effectiveness of the insecticide against pod borer on chick pea. The experiment was conducted using one chickpea variety; Habru (more preferred) and two insecticide Diazenon (1.2l/ha) and Karate (400ml/ha). The result revealed that both insecticides were effective against pod borer even if they have slight difference on percent larval reductions at both districts. The pod borer damage reduction by different treatments ranged from 71.87% to 90.63% and 58.33% to 66.66% compared to that in control at Ginir and Goro, respectively. Diazenon resulted maximum seed yield 2610kg/ha and 2200kg/ha at Ginir and Goro, respectively. The plot sprayed with Diazenon gave the maximum net return birr 75,348/ha and 61,120/ha at Ginir and Goro, respectively. It is recommended that these insecticides are suggested to the growers for the management of pod borer population below economic threshold level under field conditions.

N2  - Sorghum suffers from a lot of pests among which covered smut is the most important. Covered smut induced by the fungus Sporisorium sorghi and it is extremely seed-borne and seedling infection occurs at the time of germination and emergence of seedlings. The incidence of covered kernel smut varies from place to place, but in Ethiopia, it was estimated to be about 50%. This activity initiated to provide practical training on sorghum covered identification, monitoring, and technical skills to experts and farmers and to demonstrate the effect of seed dressing fungicides and traditional packages against sorghum covered smut. The field demonstration was laid out on a single plot with 4 treatments; Cow urine 1:1 (v/v) mixture, Thiram, Apron plus with 3g/kg, and Control untreated as a check. The plot size of the experiment was 10m x 10m with a plant spacing of 15cm and 75cm row spacing. Data on covered smut incidence and grain yield were recorded yield loss and partial budget analysis was made. Training of trainers on sorghum agronomic practices and diseases was given to 79 male and 37 female development agents for four woreda in central Gondar and development agents also gave training for 7925 male and 502 female farmers. There was no infestation of covered smut on fungicide dressed and cultural cow urine-soaked plots on both locations while an incidence of 2.8% at Gondar Zuria and 22.7% at Mirab Belesa. Relative yield advantage of the fungicides and cow urine is calculated over the control untreated check. Yield advantage of 20-26% on apron plus, 13-30% on Thiram, and 16-35% on cow urine were obtained over the untreated control check. Farmers have to use the nearby available cultural (cow urine) practice method and if not one of the available fungicides for control of covered kernel smut on sorghum production and should also be scaled out.

N2  - The study was aimed at identifying potential opportunities and constraints of beekeeping in Horo district, Horo Guduru Wollega Zone, Oromia regional state, Ethiopia. Formal and informal survey methods were used to collect information of secondary data and response on structured questionnaires. For the study 30 household beekeepers from each kebele at total of one hundred eighty households were selected randomly from both highland and midland agro-ecology. From 180 household head interviewed 98.9% were male headed and the rest 1.1% were female headed households. 90% of respondents attended primary and junior school level education. The major opportunities to engage on honeybee beekeeping were presence of governmental organization and Non-governmental Organization that works on beekeeping towards its improvement, readiness of beekeepers to accept new technology, presence of huge numbers of honeybee colony, availability of lending institutions, beekeepers' experience, soil and water conservation practices of the area, abundant honeybee forages, sufficient water sources for honeybees and marketing situation of honeybee products. Whereas, the major constraints that affects beekeeping in the district were pesticide and herbicide application (17.8%), pests (16.1%), beekeeping equipment (14.4%), shortage of bee forage (11.7%), lack of improved beehive (10%), migration (7.8%), Absconding (7.2%), lack of extension services (5.6%), swarming (3.9%) and dearth of bee colony (2.2%). Generally, the high potential is manifested with abundance of honeybees, availability of honeybee flora, demand of honeybee product in market and experience of honey beekeeper in the areas. These potentials were under exploited due to existence of constraints demanding immediate intervention, particularly on improved technology adoption and frequent improvement of beekeepers knowledge and skill is mandatory.

N2  - Abstract Pesticides are the parent compounds, their metabolites, and associated impurities of agricultural and health chemical inputs. If they are found concentration level higher than the standard limits, they have potential negative impacts on ecosystem in general and in fish and humans in particular. This study investigates organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) residue occurrences in fish muscle and assesses their public health potential risks, in North West Ethiopia. The concentration of OCPs residue under GC-ECD detected in 37.84% fish muscle samples. The mean amount detected were Endosalfan I, 341.50 ± 32.19 μg/kg; Endosalfan II, 36.01 ± 2.3μg/kg; Endosalfan sulfate, 5.43 ± 4.06 μg/kg; 4,4, DDE, 64.01 ± 9.08μg /kg; 4, 4, DDD, 5.65 ± 3.12μg /kg; and 4,4, DDT, 1.58 ± 0.30μg/kg. The mean concentration of Endosalfan I tested fish muscle sample was higher than that of permissible limit of different international standards. However, due to low per capital consumption rate of fish origin food in Ethiopia, health risk index (HRI) ranges from 0.002-0.1275 which shows there is no public health risk. This study highlights the possibilities of chemical residues occurrence in fish food products and hence pesticide use regulations and monitoring concentration level should be implemented regularly to avoid human and environmental health risks.

N2  - Promoting the agricultural sector with up-to-date technologies and inputs is convenient to enhance productivity. Production intervention is needed by introducing and adopting proper agronomic practices. Improved agricultural technologies increase production, quality, sustain food security, economic development and natural resource conservation. Koka, Meki and Ziway are known for their vegetable production as well as intensive agrochemicals consumption. Agrochemicals are applied on farm to enhance soil fertility, reduce pathogens, and induce plant growth. Tomato is one of the main commercial cash crops in these areas. Most commercially productive tomato varieties are highly sensitive to disease, vulnerable to nutrient deficiency, and other abiotic stress that requires rigorous agrochemical inputs. Ethiopian tomato production is very low due to various contributing factors including lack of improved varieties, diseases, pests, poor farming system, soil fertility maintenance as well as poor irrigation system. Farmers in the study areas applied inaccurate agrochemicals dose, rate, and application schedule that foster repeated spray. Intense agrochemical application leads to adverse environmental and health impacts due to deposit of toxic chemicals, residue leakage to water bodies and air pollution. It is important to practice proper agricultural inputs, reduce hazardous chemical residues, protect humans, other beneficial organisms and the environment. Moreover, developing IPM technology is recommended for better healthy agricultural production and sustainability.

N2  - Despite the encroaching of endemic malaria to highland-fringe areas above 2000 meters above sea level in Ethiopia, there is limited information on ownership and use of mosquito nets for malaria prevention. Thus, this study was designed to assess long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) possession and use for malaria prevention in highland-fringe of south-central Ethiopia. A multi-stage sampling technique was employed to obtain household data from randomly selected households using household head interview in October and November 2008. Household LLIN possession and use was assessed using adjusted Odds Ratio obtained from complex samples logistic regression analysis. Only less than a quarter (23.1%) of 739 households interviewed owned LLINs with more differences between low (54.2%) high (3.5%) altitudes (Χ 2 =253, P < 0.001). Higher LLIN ownership was observed in illiterate (adj.OR 35.1 [10.6-116.2]), male-headed (adj.OR 1.7 [1.051-2.89]), owning two or more beds (adj.OR 2.7 [1.6-4.6]), not doing draining/refilling of mosquito breeding sites (adj.OR 3.4 [2.1-5.5]) and absence of rivers or streams (adj.OR 6.4 [3.5-11.8]) of household variables. The presence of ≥2 LLINs hanging (adj.OR 21.0 [5.2-85.1]), owning two or more LLINs (adj.OR 4.8 [1.3-17.5]), not doing draining/refilling of mosquito breeding sites (adj.OR 4.2 [1.3-13.6]), low wealth status (adj.OR 3.55 [1.04-12.14]), and < 1 km distance from absence of rivers or streams (adj.OR 3.9 [1.2-12.1]) of households was associated with more likely use of LLIN. The LLIN ownership was low in the highlands, and most of the highland users bought the bed nets themselves. This study found a low household LLIN ownership and use in the highland-fringe rural area. Therefore, improving the availability and teaching effective use of LLIN combined with removal of temporary mosquito breeding places should be prioritized in highland-fringe areas.

N2  - There are reports of unsafe occupational handling and use of pesticide in recently intensifying commercial farming systems in Ethiopia. Very few studies reported the effect of occupational pesticide exposure on smaller airway respiratory parameters of farm workers from low and middle-income counties. A cross-sectional spirometry survey was carried out on randomly selected 387 subjects with an objective of investigating whether occupational exposure to pesticides is associated with a reduction in values of smaller airway respiratory parameters. 206 occupationally exposed (142 male pesticide applicators and 64 female re-entry workers) selected from commercial farms and 180 occupationally un-exposed male and female individuals involved in the survey. After controlling for potential confounders, pesticide exposure in male study subjects was associated with reduced respiratory parameters of Forced Expired Flow at 25% of vital capacity (FEF25%) (l/s) [β=−0.69 (95% CI −1.11_−0.27)] and Forced Expired Flow at 75% of vital capacity (FEF75%) (l/s) [β=−0.49 (95% CI −0.78_−0.20]. Also a reduction in respiratory parameters of Forced Expired Flow at 50% of vital capacity (FEF50%) [β=−0.52 (95% CI −0.95_−0.09)] was seen among exposed female subjects. The study indicated occupational exposure to pesticides is associated with a reduction of respiratory parameters of smaller airways in both male and female farm workers. Further longitudinal studies on respiratory parameters are warranted in Ethiopian farm workers.

N2  - Bread wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) is an important cereal grown in the highlands of Ethiopia. Various biotic and abiotic stresses affected the production and productivity of wheat. From biotic stresses, yellow rust and stem rust disease of wheat that caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici and Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici are among the devastating and wheat production bottlenecks. Therefore, a field experiment was done at two highland of Guji zone (Bore and Ana Sora) under rain-fed condition during the 2019/20 main cropping season to evaluate effects of different fungicides on wheat rust diseases, yield and yield components of bread wheat. The treatments consisted of five fungicides including standard check and nil application using bread wheat variety Kubsa. A randomized complete block design with three replications was used to conduct up the experiment. The partial budget analysis was carried out to assess financial profitability of fungicide application for the management of rusts. Analysis of the results revealed that the application of fungicides significantly affected rust diseases, growth parameters and yield attributes except date to heading and date maturity. Fungicide spray treatments significantly reduced both rusts (yellow and stem) rust diseases severity to the lowest level and increment of yield over the nil application. The minimum yellow rust and stem rust diseases severity recorded from the test fungicide Take-Off 293% SC while maximum yellow rust and stem rust diseases severity were recorded at unsprayed plot. There was significant difference (p < 5%) in grain yield, biomass yield, thousand seed weight, plant height, spike length and rust (yellow and stem) between fungicide treatments and control/nil application. The highest grain yield (2738 kg/ha) was obtained from Take-Off 293% SC sprayed plots while the lowest (987 kg/ha) was from nil application. Take-Off 293% SC revealed better grain yield advantage than the standard Check fungicide and control by about 5.6 and 63.95, respectively. Moreover, all fungicide applications showed a considerable production advantage over untreated plots. Take-Off 293% SC controlled effectively both rusts (yellow and stem) diseases of wheat by increasing yield of wheat. Therefore, based on partial budget analysis, yield and rust disease control, using of Take-Off 293% SC fungicide which leads to the optimum yield of bread wheat by decreasing rusts and can be recommended for the study area and other areas with similar agro-ecologies.

N2  - Seasonal migrant workers are at increased risk of malaria and can play a substantial role in transmitting the disease to receptive areas. Assessments conducted among these workers showed a high prevalence of malaria. This qualitative study aimed to explore the contributing factors and challenges to the high malaria prevalence among seasonal migrant workers in agricultural farm areas. The study also sought to identify potential solutions. A descriptive phenomenological approach was employed to investigate the perceived causes, challenges, and solutions related to malaria prevalence among seasonal migrant workers in the development corridors of southwest Ethiopia. This approach emphasizes describing experiences as they are, without researcher interpretation. Data were gathered from 24 individuals purposefully selected for their close involvement with seasonal migrant workers and their experience with malaria issues in agricultural farm areas. Open-ended questions were used, and interviews were conducted in safe, quiet settings. Data management was performed using Open Code software version 4.03, and thematic analysis was applied to the contents. The study findings identified origin from highland areas, low health-seeking behaviour, working at night, and lack of use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) as the perceived causes of high malaria prevalence among seasonal migrant workers by the study participants. Limited collaboration among stakeholders, a lack of migrant-friendly malaria prevention strategies, and inconsistent support for medical supplies were challenges highlighted by the key informants. Therefore, seasonal migrant workers were faced with high risk of malaria due to factors such as lack of immunity, delayed treatment, exposure to mosquitoes, and limited prevention efforts. Addressing these challenges is crucial for reducing malaria prevalence among this vulnerable population. The study findings highlighted the need for targeted interventions to address the specific factors contributing to high malaria prevalence among seasonal migrant workers and to overcome the challenges in implementing effective malaria prevention strategies in this vulnerable population. Further study should be conducted to include the views and positions of seasonal migrant workers, owners of the farm areas, host communities, and political leaders.

N2  - Maize is prone to insect pests during grain storage, leading farmers to rely on synthetic insecticides. However, the use of these chemicals has been associated with insect resistance and negative impacts on non-targeted species. The adoption of hermetic principles for pesticide-free grain storage is globally recognized as a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic pesticides. To address losses in stored maize, trials were conducted at Bako, West Ethiopia to compare the effectiveness of pesticide-free hermetic grain storage and traditional polypropylene bags in terms of quantitative losses and seed quality, including germination potential, after three and six months of storage. The on-station trial followed a completely randomized design with three replicates of three treatments: Metal silo, PICS bag, and polypropylene bags without synthetic insecticide. On-farm trials with the same treatments were replicated on four smallholder farms, allowing natural insect infestation. Samples were assessed for total insect count, insect mortality, grain moisture content, grain damage, weight loss, and germination percentage. The results showed that hermetic treatments effectively controlled insect development, grain damage, and weight loss compared to non-hermetic treatments, with significant differences (P&lt;0.05) observed. Seed viability was maintained in hermetic treatments, with high germination percentages (&gt;92%) compared to non-hermetic treatments (&lt;72%). There were no significant differences in grain moisture content among the storage methods. Overall, hermetic storage technologies proved effective in suppressing insect development, reducing losses, and preserving seed viability without the use of insecticides. These findings support the adoption of hermetic storage by small-scale farmers to improve food security and income generation in the country.

N2  - Abstract Pesticides are very important risk factors in human life causing chronic human health effects. Pesticides are commonly used across the globe to enhance human endeavors. In Ethiopia, pesticides are widely used by local farmers and governmental organizations for pests control purpose. However, majority of pesticides are not specifically targeting the pest. As a result, pesticide residues in food items have been a concern to the consumers and environment they live in. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine the amount of organo-chlorine and organo-phosphate pesticide residues in cereal crops in Bench-Maji Zone, Ethiopia. Experimental study design was employed to determine the amount of pesticide residues and cereal crops were bought from the local farm sites and market of purposively selected sites. The samples were extracted using a Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe extraction and clean up method. Finally, the extracted samples were injected into Gas chromatography tandem Mass Spectrometer and the types, and concentrations of pesticide residues were analyzed using linear regression equation that obtained from calibration curves. The highest concentration of Endosulfan sulfate (0.076 mgkg − 1 ) was detected in rice, followed by Dimethoate (0.068 mgkg − 1 ) and p,p’-DDE (0.087 mgkg − 1 ) in Sorghum and common millet, respectively in the samples obtained from Gurafarda site. The highest concentration of p,p’-DDT (0.133 mgkg − 1 ) was detected in common millet, followed by Aldrin (0.082mgkg − 1 ) and Dimethoate (0.077mgkg − 1 ) in Sorghum and common millet, respectively in the samples obtained from North-Bench site. In addition, Aldrin detected in rice, sorghum and common millet obtained from the three sites was a residue of above the maximum residual limits set by Codex Alimentarius regulations and European Union. The finding shows that the detection of pesticide residues in cereal crops in samples obtained from the study area. It is an indication of the widespread use of pesticides in cereal crops production. Therefore, strict supervision of pesticide application in the fields, regulation of informal veterinary drug store and implmentation of integrated vector management strategy are recommended.

N2  - Outdoor biting, outdoor resting, and early evening biting of Anopheles arabiensis is a challenge in current malaria control and elimination efforts in Africa. Zooprophylaxis using livestock treated with macrocyclic lactones is a novel approach to control zoophilic vectors. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the pharmacokinetics and insecticidal efficacy of ivermectin (IVER), doramectin (DORA), and moxidectin (MOXI) subcutaneous (SC) formulations in treated calves. The study was conducted using indigenous (Bos indicus) calves treated with SC formulation at a dosage of 0.5, 0.2 or 0.05 mg/kg body weight (BW) IVER or DORA and 0.2 or 0.05 mg/kg BW MOXI. Direct skin feeding of mosquitoes and animal blood sampling were performed at 4, 8, 12, and 24 h and on days 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, and 35 post treatment. The survival of fully fed A. arabiensis mosquitoes was monitored for 10 days. Plasma samples were analyzed using UHPLC-MS/MS. A. arabiensis mortality percentages in the 0.5 mg/kg BW DORA and IVER groups were 65.74% (95% CI: [54.98; 76.50]) and 64.53% (95% CI: [53.77; 75.29]), respectively, over 35 days post treatment. At the recommended dose (0.2 mg/kg BW), promising overall A. arabiensis mortality rates of 61.79% (95% CI: [51.55; 72.03]) and 61.78% (95% CI: [51.02; 72.54]) were observed for IVER and DORA, respectively. In contrast, A. arabiensis mortality in the MOXI group was 50.23% (95% CI: [39.87, 60.58]). At 0.2 mg/kg BW dose, area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0−inf) values for IVER, DORA, and MOXI were 382.53 ± 133.25, 395.41 ± 132.12, and 215.85 ± 63.09 ng day/mL, respectively. An extended elimination half-life (T1/2el) was recorded for DORA (4.28 ± 0.93 d), at 0.2 mg/kg BW dose level, compared to that for IVER (3.16 ± 1.47 d). The T1/2el of MOXI was 2.17 ± 0.44 day. A maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was recorded earlier for MOXI (10 h) than for IVER (1.6 days) and longer for DORA (3.0 days). For DORA and IVER, significant differences were found in T1/2el (P<0.05), Cmax (P<0.01), and AUC0−inf (P<0.01) between the higher 0.5 mg/kg BW and the lower 0.05 mg/kg BW doses. The T1/2el and AUC0−inf of DORA and IVER in the present study were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the observed insecticidal efficacy against A. arabiensis mosquitoes at 0.2 mg/kg a dose. Therefore, treating cattle with IVER or DORA could complement the malaria vector control interventions, especially in Ethiopia, where the zoophilic malaria vector A. arabiensis majorly contribute for residual malaria transmission.

N2  - Phosphorous is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. Most of the soil is deficient in plant available phosphorous and due to economic limitations majority of Ethiopian farmers applied inadequate fertilizers. It is essential to stabilize a mechanism to access P for plants with an efficient, cheap, and eco-friendly approach for enhanced crop growth and production. The main objective of this study was to screen efficient phosphate solubilizing bacteria from tomato rhizosphere soil. Using halo zone formation on PVK agar medium, more than 400 PSB isolates were isolated from 13 rhizosphere soil samples. By evaluating SI, texture in the culture-re-culturing process, liquid medium pH change efficiency and growth rate, upmost three promising PSB isolates (K-1-29, K-10-27, and K-10-41) were selected. Incubation of the isolates in PVK broth for five days showed significant pH reduction. For instance, isolate K-10-41 showed significant pH change (4.02) which indicates the organic acid production. Isolation and evaluation of efficient phosphate solubilizing bacteria maintain soil fertility, promote plant growth, induce plant response to pathogens, reduce agrochemical consumption and promote sustainable agriculture. Therefore, these selected PSB isolates need further detailed study for taxonomic identification, plant growth promotion, host range, and phytopathogen response. Local isolation improves environmental adaptation and indigenous competition.

N2  - This study investigated physicochemical properties and pesticide residue levels of honey from West Shewa Zone, Ethiopia. The results of moisture, electrical conductivity, pH, free acidity, reducing sugar, sucrose, ash, and total solids were found to be 16.61–18.64%, 0.384–0.646 mS/cm, 3.77–4.22, 7.42–13.87 meq/kg, 61.38–72.87%, 6.84–15.94%, 0.030–0.095%, and 81.36–83.28%, respectively. Correlation analysis has shown moderate positive correlation at P < 0.01 between sucrose and ash (r = 0.555), and a strong negative correlation between moisture and total solids (r = -0.9171). Residues of 4,4-DDD, 4,4-DDT, Dieldrin, α-Endosulfan, and β-Endosulfan were detected, among 20 organochlorine pesticides analyzed. Most physicochemical parameters have been found within the acceptable range set by national and international standards except sucrose content from Ejere and Toke Kutaye. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of pesticides identified in samples were below acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), that indicate honey ingesting has a negligible influence to toxicological risk.

N2  - Potato (Solanum Tuberosum L.) was originated in the central high lands of the Andes in South America and was brought to Europe in the 16th century. It is the world's fourth most widely cultivated food crop after wheat, rice and maize. Ethiopia has considerable potential for potato cultivation, as 70 percent of its arable land is suitable mainly highland areas above 1500 meters of altitude. Also, the country is one of the major producers in Eastern Africa because of its suitable agro-ecology and its domestic consumption levels. The main objective of the review was to know potato production and marketing status by small holder farmers in Ethiopia. The data were collected from secondary sources mainly from FAOSTAT, CSA and different published materials on production and marketing chain in Ethiopia. The general idea of the review shows that Ethiopia has potential for potato production but lack of certified improved seed for potato producers, local seed multipliers have limited access to information and depend on low-quality local potato varieties selected and multiplied according to individual knowledge, the high cost of agro-chemicals either refuse to purchase fertilizer or apply inadequate amounts per hectare. In addition, the use of the same type of chemicals repeatedly allows pests and diseases to develop resistance. The major constraints of potato marketing involve poor storage and handling and low upgrading strategies to the commodity. Lack of market information providing institutions, higher input price, multiple taxes, and chemical herbicides, adulteration, absence of road service, poor product quality and high cost of input, weak market linkages among market. Therefore, the government and other concerned bodies should focus on increasing production and productivity of potato which in turn focused for establishing well potato market development for mutual benefits of all actors.

N2  - Tef is stable crop food in Ethiopia. However, many farmers were not food secured and only few model farmers used tef for their daily local food. This is due to the use of low yielder varieties. On the other hand, improved tef varieties were not disseminated for surplus production. Therefore, it is important to find the way of improved tef varieties were disseminated in potential areas of Guji zone. This activity was conducted to popularize improved Dagim tef variety, strengthen stakeholders' linkage and to improve farmers' income. Purposively, Adola Rede, Odo Shakiso and Wadera were selected based on their tef potential and suitable for monitoring. Seven (7) kebeles were selected from the selected districts. Totally, 83 farmers were selected for pre scaling up tef at the midlands of Guji zone. In addition, four FTCs were used as multiplication site as a seed source for the next season. 400kg of Dagim variety was distributed. Each farmer was obtained 4.5kg Dagim variety and sown it on 0.25ha. Training was used to enhance farmers' knowledge and skills on Dagim production and field day was used to motivate farmers to grow Dagim tef variety. The stakeholder had participated during training and field day to strengthen linkage on seed, agricultural inputs and information. Hand weeding and herbicide was used to control weed. Yield, cost of production and farmers perception were collected by interview method. Data was analyzed by descriptive statistics, net income and narration. The yield performance of Dagim variety was 9.82 qt/ha which low compared to national and demonstration stage due to lack of rainfall during 2020 and 2021/22 year. The result of net income showed that production of Dagim variety generated a return of 15735.72 ETB/ha. More net income (17551.63 ETB/ha) was obtained at Odo Shakiso district followed by Adola Rede district (16503.36 ETB/ha). There was a good yield and income at some farmers who sown Dagim variety at mid of September month. Dagim variety should be disseminated in the midland districts of Guji Zone. Since tef can be produced twice in a year provision of tef variety and fertilizer for farmers should available based the seasons.

N2  - Abstract Background : Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium infecting red blood cells. Malaria infection during pregnancy is a significant public health problem that puts pregnant women at risk. Due to the asymptomatic nature of malaria patients, diagnosis has been difficult, definitions have been inconsistent, and there has been a general lack of urgency to explore this illness outcome. Because asymptomatic malaria represents a challenge in interrupting transmission in a population and the asymptomatic host serves as a reservoir for the malaria parasite, it is now recognized as a major barrier to malaria elimination. This study aims to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria and associated factors among pregnant women in the Boset District, East Shoa Zone, Oromia, Ethiopia Methods : A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence and associated factors of asymptomatic malaria in pregnant women from February to March 2022. Using multistage sample techniques, 328 asymptomatic pregnant women were enrolled. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. A rapid test and Giemsa-stained blood smear microscopy were used to diagnose Plasmodium infections. Epi info version 7 was used to code, enter, and clean data before being uploaded to SPSS version 25.0 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression were utilized to find the associated factors. Results : Of the total 328 pregnant women who participated in this study, 9(2.74%) and 10(3.05%) were confirmed to be infected with Plasmodium species by microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests, respectively. Malaria during pregnancy was found to be significantly associated with not using an insecticide-treated bed net [AOR: 9.66; 95 % CI: (2.03-45.98), lack of consultation and health education about malaria prevention during Antenatal care attendance [AOR: 4.19; 95 % CI: (1.07, 16.44), and living close stagnant water [AOR: 7.58; 95% CI: (1.06, 18.66). Conclusions : The current study showed asymptomatic malaria is prevalent in pregnant women. Insecticide-treated bed nets, Health education during Antenatal care, and living close to stagnant water had a significant association with malaria. This indicates pregnant women have to be screened for asymptomatic malaria and educated on malaria preventive methods during Antenatal care services.

N2  - Background: Stunting is a serious impediment to child survival and developing a full learning capacity. Despite several decades of efforts, stunting remained a major public health concern in Ethiopia. Thus, periodic assessment of the factors associated with stunting is imperative. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among school-age children in Eastern Ethiopia. Anthropometric measurements were taken according to the World Health Organization standard procedures. A child was identified as stunted if height-for-age z score is <−2 standard deviations of the median of the reference population. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with stunting. Clustering of stunting within schools was controlled during analysis using cluster option in STATA syntax. Results: The prevalence of stunting among school-aged children was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.6–10.3); of which 2% had severe stunting. The risk of stunting was 1.71 times greater for children born to working mothers than those born to housewives (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] =1.71; 95% CI: 1.08–2.72). Those children whose families did not use a bed net in their home were 1.76 times more likely to be stunted as children than those whose families used insecticide-treated nets (AOR =1.76; 95% CI: 1.22–2.52). Moreover, the risk of stunting was 1.59 times greater for children who had suffered from illness within the last 2 weeks than children who were apparently healthy (AOR =1.59; 95% CI: 1.04–2.40). On the other hand, the risk of stunting was 30% lower for children born to an older mother than a younger one. Conclusion: Stunting, which is indicative of chronic malnutrition, was 8.9% among school-aged children in Kersa, Ethiopia. It was associated with maternal working status, maternal age, child morbidity status, and not using insecticide-treated nets at the household level. Nutrition programs that focus on improving childhood nutrition and promoting linear growth, conducting focused public education to increase the use of mosquito net, will benefit children.

N2  - Maize is a key determinant of food security, mainly grown as subsistence in Ethiopia. It was introduced to Ethiopia in 1600's from Mexico. Food security of Ethiopia is threatened from time to time due to crop diseases and pests. One of these is fall armyworms (Spodoptera frugiperda, J.E Smith; lepdoptera, Noctudea), which is a recently arrived American origin insect pest. As best contributor of Ethiopian economy and social development, maize is being seriously threatened by fall armyworms (FAWs). Maize production stands second in Ethiopia (20.2%) next to teff (34.2%) in terms of the land allotted. However, in terms of productivity maize stands first (45.5%) in relation to teff (29.9%), sorghum (27.2%), and wheat (26.2%). The productivity of maize is suppressed by FAW infestation very significantly (P≤ 0.05) in the previous three years after its arrival to Ethiopia in 2017. The rate of infestation ranges from 1.7 - 34.5% in the past three successive years. According to our results, maize infested by FAW in the past three successive years at regional states levels is shown to devastate produces up to 71%, with the four top infested regions being Gambella (70.4%), Afar (61.6%), Benshangul Gumuz (11.8%), and SNNPRS (10.7%). Health and environmental risks associated with the use of synthetic pesticide chemicals are very profound; hence, environmentally friendly organic based controlling methods of pests with minimum risks such as the use of botanicals, and biological controls are strongly recommended. Key words: Fall armyworm, pest, Ethiopia, maize, productivity.

N2  - Introduction: During adolescent anaemia has negative consequence on cognitive, work performance and economic productive. However, there is limited evidence on the prevalence and factors associated with anaemia among adolescent girls. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and associated factors of anaemia among rural adolescent girls in Hadero Tunto zuria district, Southern Ethiopia. Methods: A community based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among adolescent girls 10-19 years. A total of 406 subjects were randomly selected. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Blood haemoglobin level was determined from capillary blood using the Haemocue method. Data were entered into computer and analyzed using SPSS versions 20.0. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the factors associated with anaemia. Result: The mean (±SD) of haemoglobin concentration adjusted for altitude was 13.7+1.2 (SD) and ranged from 8 to 16.6g/dl. Over all prevalence of anaemia was found to be 15.2% [95%CI: 11.68%, 18.72%]. Out of the total 406 adolescent girls 13.7% [95% CI: 10.33%, 17.06%] and 1.5% [95%CI: 0.3%, 2.7%] had mild and moderate anaemia, respectively. Low dietary diversity, (AOR= 10.0, 95% CI: 1.70, 60.0), long menstrual duration (AOR=5.10, 95% CI: 1.43, 18.15), malaria attack history (AOR=3.50, 95%CI: 1.40, 8.57), and less frequent consumption of legumes (AOR=3.20, 95%CI: 1.17, 8.74) were significantly associated with anaemia. Furthermore, the prevalence of stunting and thinness was 21.3% and 16.8%, respectively. Conclusion: Anaemia is a public health problem in the study area; which require integrated governmental and NGO intervention to tackle the burden; enhance dietary diversity, promote Insecticide Treated Bednets (ITNs) utilization and adolescent nutrition education are important strategies to reduce the burden of anaemia.

N2  - Abstract Abstract Background: Anemia is the most common nutritional problem in adolescent girls and it has negative consequence on cognition, work performance and economic productivity. However, in the developing world there is limited evidence regarding the magnitude and determinants of anemia among adolescent girls. The current study highlights the burden of and factors associated with anemia in adolescent girls in Hadero district, Southern Ethiopia. Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in January, 2016 among adolescent girls 10-19 years old. A total of 407 subjects were selected using multistage cluster sampling technique. Hemoglobin level was determined from capillary blood using the HemoCue method. Factors associated with anemia (give the operational definition in bracket) were identified using bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis. The outputs of analyses are presented using adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Result: The mean (±SD) of hemoglobin concentration adjusted for altitude was 13.7 + 1.2and ranged from 8 to 16.6g/dl. The overall prevalence of anemia was 15.2% (95%CI: 11.68%, 18.72%). Out of the total 400 adolescent girls 13.7% [95% CI: 10.33%, 17.06%] and 1.5% [95%CI: 0.3%, 2.7%] had mild and moderate anemia, respectively. low dietary diversity, (AOR=3.6, 95 % CI: 1.7, 7.7), long menstrual duration (AOR=6.4, 95%CI: 1.55, 27.0), malaria attack history (AOR=3.2, 95%CI: 1.4, 7.2) and over loaded physical work load (AOR=4.0, 95%CI: 1.7, 9.5), large family size (AOR=0.37,95% CI:0.16, 0.92) and low altitude (AOR=3.2, 95%CI: 1.23, 8.3) were significantly associated with anemia. Furthermore, prevalence of stunting and thinness were 21.3% and 16.5 % respectively. Conclusion : Anemia is a mild public health problem in the study area; increasing dietary diversity, Insecticide Treated Bed nets (ITNs) utilization and adolescent nutrition education are important strategies to reduce the burden of anemia.

N2  - Malaria ranks among Ethiopia&#39;s top ten causes of illness and mortality among children under five. The disease continues to pose a severe public health risk in malaria-endemic regions like the Abobo district. Information on malaria prevalence and its determinants among under-five year&rsquo;s children in the Abobo district is missing. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Abobo Catholic Health Center in Abobo district, Southwest Ethiopia, from June 2022 to August 2022.&nbsp; A total of 265 febrile children under the age of five were consecutively enrolled in the study. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, parental/caregiver knowledge, and malaria-determining factors. Malaria was diagnosed in the health center using the Malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test and Microscopy to confirm the presence of malaria parasites. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with malaria. This study comprised 265 participants, and the response rate was 100%. 36.2% of febrile children under five had malaria. Determinants like the presence of stagnant water (AOR = 0.203, 95% CI: 0.077, 0.537), and garbage heaps close to homes (AOR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.41-4.26) were all related with an increased risk of contracting malaria. Compared to children who did not sleep under insecticide-treated nets, those who did were more likely to be protected from malaria infection (AOR = 0.238; 95% CI: 0.138-0.411). Malaria in Abobo town and the surrounding area disproportionately affected children under five. The most important determinants for malaria infections were living close to stagnant water, having garbage heaps surrounding the house, poor water drainage systems, and using insecticide-treated nets inadequately. Therefore, it is essential to strengthen community mobilization to improve the implementation of malaria prevention strategies and decrease the prevalence in the study area. Key words: Children, Ethiopia, malaria, prevalence.

N2  - Background. Malaria is one of the major public health problems in developing countries like Ethiopia. Despite efforts to reduce the mortality and morbidity, the disease is still a prominent health problem in Ethiopia. This study, therefore, was undertaken to assess the prevalence of malaria and associated factors among symptomatic patients in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods. A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2020 among 210 febrile patients attending Hamusit Health Center, Northwest Ethiopia. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and factors perceived to be associated with Plasmodium infection. Questionnaire data was collected through face to face interview. Thin and thick blood films were prepared from capillary blood buffy coat samples. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Software version 20. Results. Out of 210 malaria-suspected participants, 61 (29.0%) were confirmed to be infected by Plasmodium species. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax monoinfections were detected in 41 (19.5%) and 10 (4.8%) participants, respectively. Mixed infection was detected in 10 (4.8%) participants. Female participants ( <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M1"> <mtext>AOR</mtext> <mo>=</mo> <mn>2.261</mn> </math> ; 95% CI: 1.118-4.571; <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M2"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.023</mn> </math> ) and those having family members with history of malaria (AOR =2.261; 95% CI: 1.264-5.340; <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M3"> <mi>P</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.009</mn> </math> ) had higher odds of acquiring Plasmodium infection as compared to their counterparts. Using insecticide-treated bed net and draining stagnant water were the most commonly mentioned malaria prevention measures reported by 71.9% and 8.1% of the respondents, respectively. Conclusion. Malaria contributes significantly for febrile illnesses in the study area. Therefore, community mobilization should be strengthen in order to improve implementation of malaria control activities and, hence, reducing the prevalence.

N2  - Mango production covers 35% of the total acreage allotted for fruit production in Harari Regional State, eastern Ethiopia. However, there is a declining trend in yield and quality of fruits from the trees. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the status, practices and challenges of mango production in the study area. Interviews were made taking 70 mango growers selected purposively in the major mango growing areas of the region using semi-structured questionnaire from 2012 to 2013. The results indicated that 50% of the households have few mango trees, 10-20 trees that are from seedling in origin derived from very few trees that were introduced from abroad via missionaries and traders a century ago. As a result, wide variations were observed in phenotypic features of trees within a farm as well as throughout the study area. In total, 39 distinct eco-types were recorded. Input shortage (water, fertilizer and pesticide), lack of improved technologies, pests (especially fruit fly and anthracnose), postharvest loss and poor marketing were the major problems specified by the growers. Therefore, focus should be given in improving the production, productivity and marketing of the crop in order to utilize the available and adaptable mango eco-types which are on the verge of disappearance.

N2  - Aromatic plants are plants that possess aromatic compounds, most of which are essential oils which are volatile at room temperature. They can be used as raw materials for extraction of essential oils which, in turn, are used in the flavor and fragrance industries, as well as the sources of spices, herbs, and other natural products such as traditional medicines, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, botanical pesticides, insect repellents, herbal teas/drinks, etc. Aiming to this, Wondo genet agricultural research center (one of the centers of Ethiopian institute of agricultural research)is responsible in doing research, promoting and coordinating aromatic, medicinal and bio energy plants at national level including other research activities on soil and water, livestock, forestry, and other food crops. In Ethiopia; other than the traditional aspect, the scientific aspect of aromatic and medicinal plants is not well known and little has been done on their economic contribution to households. Therefore Wondo genet agricultural research center has been done cost-benefit analysis for a selected aromatic grass namely Cymbopogon winterianus at wondo genet experimental site. The selected plant was planted based on its recommended spacing at wondo genet experimental site and the required data was collected. For the analysis net return to land (birr/ha) was used as a parameter. The analysis shows that, the selected aromatic grass provides the net return of which is 80417.32 birr/ha at fresh bio mass price of 1 birr. The NPV and BCR for Nardos grass was found to be: 76,858.5 and 2.3 respectively.

However, access to improved onion variety is limited in the area. Thus, this study aimed to demonstrate the improved onion variety with its agronomic management in the production season. Onion growers were purposely selected and have taken training on onion production by using recommended doses of fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, and suitable agronomic practices. Each agro-pastoralist covered 0.064 hectares of land by improved onion. The recorded data from the field experiment and agro-pastoral perceptions were analyzed through simple descriptive and preference ranking tools. From the result of the demonstration trial, the mean bulb yield of the improved onion (Nafis variety) was 125 qt/ha. The average return obtained from the sale of onion bulbs per hectare was 334,925 Ethiopian birr. Moreover, the benefit-to-cost ratio of improved onion production was 8.34:1, which indicates the benefits outweigh the costs, suggesting a positive return on improved onion production in the area. The agro-pastoralist’s preference further showed that the Nafis variety was the best one or superior to the local variety in terms of its high-yielding ability, dark green leaf color, medium bulb size, and market preference. Therefore, the authors suggest the respective government and non-government bodies to further promote improved onion in the area.

N2  - Potato plays important roles in Ethiopia's economy through ensuring food security as well as source of income for potato farming community.In addition to breaking tubers' dormancy and enhancing sprouting, plant growth regulators (PGRs) are known to affect tubers' quality components of potatoes which are usually governed by genotypes and some other abiotic factors.However, whether PGRs affect tubers' quality components of Ethiopia's potato varieties has not been known and documented in the past.Hence, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of pre-treatment of seed tubers with different plant growth regulators on some tubers' quality components of two common potato varieties in Ethiopia.The study evaluated the effect of three PGRs viz.Gibberrelic Acid (GA3), Benzyladenine (BA) and Benzylamino purine (BAP) at two concentrations (0.1mM and 0.2mM) and distilled water-DW as untreated control on some tubers' quality components of variety Belete and Jalenie at Kulumsa Agricultural Research Center, Southeast Ethiopia in 2018.Forty sprouted tubers from each treatment combination (two varieties and three PGRs at two concentrations with untreated control-DW) were planted per plot (9m 2 ) in a factorial experiment using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) and replicated three times.The required agronomic practices such as cultivation (weeding), ridging, fertilization, pesticide application, etc. were applied uniformly to all experimental units as needed.The results showed that both varieties were different in their responses to the PGRs used, while BA and BAP showed a significant effect on most of the tuber quality components compared to GA3 at the lowest concentration (0.1mM) although no significant difference was obtained between BA and BAP.However, the two varieties Belete and Jalenie were found to be different in the tubers' qualities measured and between plant growth regulators.Belete was better than Jalenie in terms of tubers' specific gravity, dry matter and starch content and total soluble solids regardless of the effect of the PGRs.Hence, either BA or BAP or both could be used as pre-treatment plant growth regulators to improve the quality components of potato tubers of the two varieties.

N2  - Maize is one of the most widely grown crops in Ethiopia and is a staple crop around the globe; however, common rust maize disease (CRMD) is becoming a serious problem and severely impacts yields. Conventional CRMD detection and treatment methods are time-consuming, expensive, and ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time deep-learning model that provides disease detection and pesticide dosage recommendations. In the model development process, we collected 5000 maize leaf images experimentally, with permission from Haramaya University, and increased the size of the dataset to 8000 through augmentation. We applied image preprocessing techniques such as image equalization, noise removal, and enhancement to improve model performance. Additionally, during training, we utilized batch normalization, dropout, and early stopping to reduce overfitting, improve accuracy, and improve execution time. The optimal model recognizes CRMD and classifies it according to scientifically established severity levels. For pesticide recommendations, the model was integrated with the Gradio interface, which provides real-time recommendations based on the detected disease type and severity. We used a convolutional neural network (CNN), specifically the ResNet50 model, for this purpose. To evaluate its performance, ResNet50 was compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms, including VGG19, VGG16, and AlexNet, using similar parameters. ResNet50 outperformed the other CNN models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score, achieving over 97% accuracy in CRMD classification—surpassing the other algorithms by more than 2.5% in both experimental and existing datasets. The agricultural experts verified the accuracy of the recommendation system across different stages of the disease, and the system demonstrated 100% accuracy. Additionally, ResNet50 exhibited lower time complexity during model development. This study demonstrates the potential of ResNet50 models for improving maize disease management.

N2  - The slow progress in endemicity mapping of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in Africa and scaling up of mass drug administration (MDA) in all endemic countries has hampered efforts to meet the London Declaration's 2020 elimination and control targets. Lymphatic filariasis is targeted to be eliminated by 2020; but by the end of 2012, 11 of the 73 countries currently endemic for the disease had not completed the endemicity mapping to define the true number of people requiring interventions. Ten of the 11 partly mapped or unmapped countries were in Africa, where 35 countries are known to be endemic for this disease. Lymphatic filariasis is a high-burden, mosquito-borne NTD that affects 1·1 billion people worldwide.1WHOGlobal programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis: progress report, 2014.Wkly Epidemiol Rec. 2015; 90: 489-504Google Scholar In Africa, the number of people requiring treatment for lymphatic filariasis in the 35 endemic countries decreased from 472·1 million in 2013, to 409·7 million in 2014. The reduction is partly due to a reassessment of the at-risk population through a renewed, large-scale, and accelerated endemicity mapping or remapping exercise to accurately establish the burden of NTDs in the region. Mapping in previously only partly mapped or unmapped countries was initiated in 2013 by WHO's Regional Office in Africa, using refined survey methods.1WHOGlobal programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis: progress report, 2014.Wkly Epidemiol Rec. 2015; 90: 489-504Google Scholar We argue that with endemicity mapping still ongoing in the high-burden countries of the Democratic Republic of Congo (49·1 million people at risk of infection), Nigeria (114·3 million), and Tanzania (45·9 million),1WHOGlobal programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis: progress report, 2014.Wkly Epidemiol Rec. 2015; 90: 489-504Google Scholar the true number of people requiring interventions against lymphatic filariasis could be much lower than current estimates. Elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem by 2020 will be achieved mainly through preventive chemotherapy, based on annual MDA to entire eligible populations living in implementation units (usually a district) where lymphatic filariasis is endemic (ie, if one person is reportedly positive for the disease after surveying two communities, examining about 100 people per community—ie, rate of microfilaria or circulating filarial antigen [CFA] is ≥1% in either community).2WHOWorld Health Organization global programme to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.

Residual spraying was done in areas previously endemic for lymphatic filariasis including southern Uganda, eastern Kenya, and northern Tanzania, which are now all non-endemic.10Allsopp R Options for vector control against trypanosomiasis in Africa.Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 15-19Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar Many unmapped areas in Botswana, Nigeria, and Zimbabwe could also be free of lymphatic filariasis transmission because vast areas were exposed to residual spraying against HAT for several years in the 1970s and 1980s. In Zimbabwe and Nigeria, residual spraying activities in 10 years covered between 148 000 km2 and 210 000 km2 of land.10Allsopp R Options for vector control against trypanosomiasis in Africa.Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 15-19Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar In addition to the effect of vector control against malaria and HAT on lymphatic filariasis endemicity over several years, recent improvements in NTD mapping strategies and diagnosis of Loa loa have greatly affected the outcomes of surveys undertaken to establish the burden of NTDs in Africa. More accurate mapping efforts, revealing lower than previously thought numbers of individuals requiring interventions, should give renewed impetus to efforts to meet the 2020 target for elimination of lymphatic filariasis. We declare no competing interests.

N2  - Agriculture, with almost equal share of the twin farming systems of crop production and livestock development, characterizes the key issues of Ethiopian economy.The first green revolution could not have got its momentum in Ethiopia due to limitations associated mainly with improved varieties, assured irrigation and, inorganic fertilizers.The continued efforts in crop varieties improvement, inventorying of soil resources, watershed development, and related activities have now amplified the potential of Ethiopia to revolutionize its agricultural developments both livestock and crop productions.However, the message from the first green revolution in terms of soil health deterioration leading to malnutrition, polluted foodstuff and water and other types of contamination of agricultural products due to excessive use of inorganic fertilizers, chemicals, insecticides and pesticides has bitterly warned the scientists and even planners to move to some compromise in the use of inorganic materials as inputs.The use of organic resources alone or in integration with inorganic materials is the quick answer to such compromise.Needless to mention, the use of organic resources for soil fertility management is virtually known almost since the beginning of agriculture.In the same fashion, the present human population world-wide wants food stuff free of pollution, contamination or even adulteration caused by unwise and unscientific use of inorganic fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals, which were the main bearing to the yield increase during the first green revolution at the expense of the quality of the produces.The second green revolution relates to restoration of quality of produce and improvement of soil health and quality.Obviously, organic farming approach is the only option for its realization.The quality of organic resources and their fertilizer equivalence are the main criteria to be judged for effective utilization of the organic resources for soil fertility improvement and promotion of agricultural products both in quantity and quality.The contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen, lignin, polyphenol and C:N ratios are some of the basic parameters to be considered in quality assessment of the organic resources.Under natural environments, there are many plant species that are useful to soil fertility improvement, but our knowledge is limited.Knowledge of organic matter turnover in soils is of vital importance in order to estimate the amount of organic resource to be added to soils to maintain the organic matter status.Soils with high C:N ratio need to have very specific management practices.The enhancement of N and P status of soils with exposures to X-rays is recently established for further validation as well as application either in field or otherwise.The clue of second green revolution lies on quality improvement of agricultural produces and this could be achieved by how could the integration of organic resource with very selective amount of inorganic fertilizers be made effective for high yields without any scope of abuse due to degradation.The considerable demand and relatively higher market values of the organically produced crop as well as livestock products for being free from pollution, high quality and healthy foodstuff are obviously positive additives and better bargaining power in the compromises with the possible reduction in quantity of yield in the short term from minimizing the use of mineral fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals.

N2  - Abstract Emergence and spread of malaria vectors resistant to the available insecticides required a new and efficacious insecticide. Residual efficacy of Fludora ® Fusion was evaluated against insecticide susceptible Anopheles arabiensis in ten circular huts similar to the residential huts. Fludora® Fusion WP-SB 562.5, FICAM WP80 and Clothianidin WG70 were sprayed, by experienced technician, on interior wall surfaces: paint, dung, smooth mud, and rough mud. WHO cone bioassays were carried out a month after spraying and thereafter on monthly intervals for 12 months. Knockdown was recorded at 60 minutes and mortality at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours holding time post-exposure. Fludora Fusion induced 100% An. arabiensis mortality during the first four months post-treated on all surface types at 24 hours holding time post-exposure. Its activity remained over 80% from the fifth to the twelfth month post-treated on the surfaces with the exception of two assessment points, at seventh month and eleventh month, on paint and smooth mud surfaces. FICAM induced 100% mortality rate during the first 4 months and 92% mortality during the fifth month post-treatment on painted surfaces. Its activity was over 96% mortality 1-month post-treatment on smooth mud and rough mud surfaces and 92% mortality 2-month post-treatment on dung surfaces. Clothianidin caused 89% and 86% mortality 1-month post-treatment on smooth mud and rough mud surfaces. Fludora Fusion can be used as alternative indoor residual insecticide spraying against An. arabiensis in Ethiopia. However, the insecticide shall also be tested in residential houses prior to employing at a larger scale.

N2  - Abstract Background: Malaria, transmitted by the bite of infective female Anopheles mosquitoes, remains a global public health problem. The presence of invasive Anopheles stephensi , capable of transmitting Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum , was first reported in Ethiopia in 2016. The ecology of this mosquito species differs from that of An. arabiensis , the primary Ethiopian malaria vector [1]. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of selected insecticides, which are used in indoor residual spraying (IRS) and selected long-lasting insecticidal treated nets (LLINs) for malaria vector control, against adults An. stephensi . Methods : Anopheles stephensi were collected as larvae and pupae from Awash Subah Kilo Town and Haro Adi village, Ethiopia. Adult female An. stephensi , reared from larvae and pupae collected from the field, aged 3-5 days were exposed to impregnated papers of IRS insecticides (propoxur 0.1%, bendiocarb 0.1%, pirimiphos-methyl 0.25%), and insecticides used in LLINs (alphacyper-methrin 0.05%, deltamethrin 0.05% and permethrin 0.75%), using diagnostic doses and WHO test tubes in a bio-secure insectary at Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology, Addis Ababa University (AAU-ALIPB). For each test and control tube, batches of 25 female An. stephensi mosquitoes were used to test each insecticide used in IRS. Additionally, cone tests were conducted to expose An. stephensi to four brands of LLINs, MAGNet ™ (alpha-cypermethrin), PermaNet ® 2.0 (deltamethrin), DuraNet © (alpha-cypermethrin) and SafeNet ® (alpha-cypermethrin). A batch of ten sugar fed female mosquitoes aged 2-5 days were exposed to samples taken from five positions/sides of a net. The data from all replicates were pooled and descriptive statistics were used to describe features of the data. Results: All An. stephensi mosquitoes collected from Awash Subah Kilo Town and Haro Adi village (around Metehara) were resistant to all tested insecticides used in both IRS and LLINs. Of the tested LLINs, only MAGNet ™ (alpha-cypermethrin active ingredient) caused 100% knockdown and mortality to An. stephensi at 60 minutes and 24 hours post exposure, while all other net brands resulted below the WHO cut- off points. All these nets, except SafeNet ® , were collected during LLIN distribution for community members through the National Malaria Program, in December 2020. Conclusions: Anopheles stephensi is resistant to all tested insecticides used in IRS and in the tested LLIN brands, except MAGNet, did not cause in mortality as expected. This suggests that control of this invasive vector using existing adult malaria vector control methods may not be appropriate and that alternative strategies may be necessary.

N2  - Coffee is one of Tanzania’s primary agricultural export commodities but is seriously constrained by Colletotrichum kahawae which causes significant yield losses in Arabica coffee during high infection seasons. Using resistant varieties rather than chemical fungicides, which are costly and cause environmental pollution, is a more sustainable approach to controlling the disease. Several F1 hybrid genotypes developed from Ethiopian accessions of Arabica coffee of known Coffee berry disease (CBD) resistance were evaluated under CBD pressure to observe acquired resistance. Eight Arabica coffee genotypes were inoculated with three types of CBD pathogen isolates. Results revealed high resistance on two F1 genotypes (F90/64/4660 x KP423 and F89/64/4660 x KP423) with no infection to all C. kahawae isolates. Two Genotypes (F45/64/2049 x KP423 and F24/64/902 x KP423) revealed resistance moderately by scoring less than 50% infected berries, while F45/64/2061 x KP423 and F24/64/886 x KP423 demonstrated moderate susceptibility. The F1 genotypes with less infection are to be included in the breeding program to develop resistant varieties. Pathogenicity of three C. kahawae isolates obtained from different coffee growing areas in Tanzania was also observed for their effects on the tested genotypes. Isolate 2006/14 from Kibosho – Kombo was more aggressive in terms of infected berries, followed by isolate 2019/16 from Ugano-Mbinga. Isolates found to be more aggressive are potential for screening resistance to develop coffee berry disease varieties in Tanzania.

N2  - Abstract Background The putative vector of trachoma, Musca sorbens , prefers to lay its eggs on human faeces on the ground. This study sought to determine whether M. sorbens females were attracted to volatile odours from human faeces in preference to odours from the faeces of other animals, and to determine whether specific volatile semiochemicals mediate selection of the faeces. Methodology/Principal findings Traps baited with the faeces of humans and local domestic animals were used to catch flies at two trachoma-endemic locations in The Gambia and one in Ethiopia. At all locations, traps baited with faeces caught more female M. sorbens than control traps baited with soil, and human faeces was the most successful bait compared with soil (mean rate ratios 44.40, 61.40, 10.50 [ P &lt;0.001]; 8.17 for child faeces [ P =0.004]). Odours from human faeces and some domestic animals were sampled by air entrainment. Extracts of the volatiles from human faeces were tested by coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography with laboratory-reared female M. sorbens . Twelve compounds were electrophysiologically active and tentatively identified by coupled mass spectrometry-gas chromatography, these included cresol, indole, 2-methylpropanoic acid, butanoic acid, pentanoic acid and hexanoic acid. Conclusions/Significance It is possible that some of these volatiles govern the strong attraction of M. sorbens flies to human faeces. If so, a synthetic blend of these chemicals, at the correct ratios, may prove to be a highly attractive lure. This could be used in odour-baited traps for monitoring or control of this species in trachoma-endemic regions. Author summary Musca sorbens , also known as the Bazaar Fly, visits people’s faces to feed on ocular and nasal discharge. While feeding, M. sorbens can transmit Chlamydia trachomatis , the bacterium that causes the infectious eye disease trachoma. Around 1.9 million people worldwide are visually impaired or blind from this disease. Although it is believed that M. sorbens transmits trachoma, very few studies have looked at ways to control this fly. A large-scale trial has shown that control of fly populations with insecticide reduces active trachoma disease prevalence. Odour-baited traps for the suppression of disease vector populations are an attractive option as there is no widespread spraying of insecticide, however, highly attractive baits are critical to their success. Here we demonstrate that the preference of these flies for breeding in human faeces is probably mediated by odour cues, and we isolate chemicals in the odour of human faeces that cause a response in the antennae of M. sorbens . These compounds may play a role in the specific attractiveness of human faeces to these flies, perhaps by being present in greater amounts or at favourable ratios. These may be developed into a chemical lure for odour-baited trapping to suppress M. sorbens populations.

N2  - Abstract Background: Ethiopia embarked on combating malaria with an aim to eliminate malaria from low transmission districts by 2030. This involves malaria vector interventions by implementing mainly indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) against endophilic and endophagic female Anopheles mosquitoes. Limited published reports are available about the status of malaria in areas under malaria elimination program in Ethiopia. This study intended to assess the prevalence of malaria in selected areas with a long history of implementing malaria prevention and elimination strategies. Methods: A cross-sectional parasitological survey was conducted in two selected malaria endemic areas in Dembiya District, Northwest Ethiopia. Thin and thick blood smears collected from 735 randomly selected individuals were microscopically examined for malaria parasites. Six years retrospective malaria data was also collected from the medical records of the health centres. Structured questionnaires were prepared to collect information about the socio-economic data of the population. The data were analysed using SPSS version 20 and p ≤0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The six-year retrospective malaria prevalence trend indicates an overall malaria prevalence of 22.4%, out of which Plasmodium falciparum was the dominant species. From a total of 735 slides examined for the presence of malaria parasites, 3.5% (n=26) were positive for malaria parasites, in which P. falciparum was more prevalent (n=17; 2.3%), P. vivax (n=5; 0.7%) , and mixed infections (n=4; 0.5%). Males were 2.6 times more likely to be infected with malaria than females (AOR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.0, 6.4), and individuals with frequent outdoor activity were 16.4 times more vulnerable than individuals with limited outdoor activities (AOR= 16.4, 95% CI: 1.8, 147.9). Furthermore, awareness about malaria transmission was significantly associated with the prevalence of malaria. Conclusions: Malaria is still a public health problem in Dembiya district irrespective of the past and existing vector control interventions. A malaria elimination plan might not be successful unless other alternative intervention tools targeting outdoor malaria transmission are included. For this, continuous monitoring of vectors’ susceptibility, density, and behaviour is very important in such areas.

N2  - Floriculture as an industry in Ethiopia is a huge industry that counts a decade. The sector began in 1997 with only two flower farms, however, today has grown more than 80 active flower farms. The industry has grown because of several favorable factors like the vicinity of the country to the global market, encouraging investment law, very cheap labor power, moreover suitable environmental resources like soil, groundwater, etc. Though it is one of the leading industry to make the country get forging currency, several environmental, animal and human health concern increases through time because of the industry uses lager amount of hazardous chemical for the pesticides purpose and growth regulator, which ends up finally with few treatment or not at all any treatments directly damp in to the environment and lead to adverse environmental impacts. This paper reviewed about gaps in the regulatory framework and the problem of not having effective regulation in such kind of industry.

N2  - Land degradation is the result of complex interaction among, physical, chemical, biological, socio-economic and political issues of local, national or global nature. Land degradation affects Ethiopian economy and also has many negative impacts on agricultural productivity by reducing the fertility of agricultural land. Land degradation is increasing in severity and extent in many parts of the world, with more than 20% of all cultivated areas, 30% of forests and 10% of grasslands undergoing degradation. Millions of hectares of land per year are being degraded in all climatic regions. It is estimated that 2.6 billion people are affected by land degradation and desertification in more than a hundred countries, influencing over 33% of the earth´s land surface. The global store of arable land and grazing land continuous to decline through urbanization, un sustainable agriculture practices and deforestation, while, significant portion of the remaining arable land and grazing land is under considerable pressure from compaction by livestock and farm implements, over use of fertilizers and pesticides, Salinization, alkalization or acidification depletion of nutrients, water and wind erosion, deterioration of drainage. The velocity of land degradation is high due to, Improper tillage operation on the land, Poor managements of land, The attitude of the community about the consequences of land degradation on agricultural productivity, Lack of knowledge of the farmers about the main biological, physical and mechanical methods of land conservation. The agricultural impacts of land degradation are, loss of soil nutrient, Soil erosion effects, reduction of crop yield, silting up of reservoir and It also contributes to persistent poverty, and results in decreasing ecosystem resilience e and provision of environmental services. In addition, environmental decline due to land degradation adversely affects the health, well-being and livelihood opportunities of the individuals.

N2  - Potato is the fourth major crop of the world after rice, wheat and maize. However, in Ethiopia, the yield per unit area of potato is very low compared to those of other countries. There are many factors that reduce the yield of the crop among which the diseases like late blight and insect like tuber moth which play an important role in reduction of the yield. Hence, the objective of this review is to review the importance of these late blight and tuber moth of potato and their management in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, late blight is occurs throughout the major potato production areas and researches have made estimates of losses ranging from 6.5 to 61.7%, depending on level of susceptibility of the varieties. Different types of management options like cultural, Fungicide Use, biological and Resistant Cultivars are the major management practices which can help in reducing late blight effect. However, because of its new strain development, there is no single effective management strategy of this disease. Therefore adopting integrated disease management approach is the most effective, environmentally safe and low costly to the users. In addition to late blight, potato tuber moth can also cause significant yield loss to potato. Potato tuber moth is the most important constraints of potato production in Ethiopia and it causes up to 42% yield loss in storage. Using different integrated pest management approaches including appropriate cultural practices, using pheromone traps, using biological control, host plant resistant, using botanicals and appropriate rate and time of chemical applications are used for reducing the damage of potato tuber moth.

N2  - Among the most important crops grown in Ethiopia wheat is one, both as a source of food and income generating venture for farmers in the country. Wheat and wheat products represent 14% of the total caloric intake in Ethiopia. Wheat is a cereal crop, which is produced in most parts of Ethiopia. Ethiopia is the second next to Egypt in Africa in wheat production which is 4.54 million tons. This study was aimed at reviewing wheat production and marketing in Ethiopia, with specific objectives of reviewing the wheat Production, supply and its Constraints in Ethiopia, major Marketing actors and function of wheat in Ethiopia, marketing structure, conduct and performance of wheat in Ethiopia as well as constraints and opportunities of wheat marketing in Ethiopia. The data were collected from secondary sources mainly from FAOSTAT, CSA and different published materials on wheat market chain in Ethiopia. The general idea of the review shows that Ethiopia has potential for wheat production but the two sides of agricultural constraints are production and marketing from the producer side faced with Rain failure, higher fertilizer price and delayed delivery, Soil erosion, Labor shortage, Lack of credit access, Lack of Draft power and Prevalence of crop diseases. On marketing side, lack of market information providing institutions, higher input price, multiple taxes, chemical herbicides adulteration, absence of road service, poor product quality and high cost of input, weak market linkages among market. In wheat marketing, the major actors identified during the review were; producers, farmer traders, urban assemblers, wholesalers, retailers, processors (millers, flour mill), consumers and commission agent. The market actors involved in different activities (wholesaling, retailing, assembly). Therefore, the government and other concerned bodies should focus on increasing production and productivity of wheat which in turn focused for establishing well wheat market development for mutual benefits of all actors.

N2  - Organic agriculture started much more recently in thousands of years ago, Agriculture almost equal share of the farming systems of crop production and characterizes the key issues of Ethiopian economy. The quality of organic resources and their fertilizer equivalence are the main criteria to be judged for effective utilization of the organic resources for soil fertility improvement and promotion of agricultural products both in quantity and quality.Organic agriculture is production system that sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people. The evaluation of organic matter in soils depends on type and nature of organic source. Organic agriculture in the extent to which African farmers certified yields (more than 50% higher than local yield averages). The export main products produced are cotton, sesame and coffee, followed by cocoa, dried fruits, frozen fruit/pulp, fresh mainly tropical fruit and spices. Ethiopia is famous as the origin of coffee and is the largest producer in Africa. Forest coffee has the advantage that it originates from an organic and shaded production area - a quality increasingly important for coffee drinkers worldwide coffee cultivation systems, superior quality and organic in nature. Certified-organic farmers will generally require a higher price to compensate for the costs of inspection, certification and the major source of foreign exchange and thus account more than half of the value of total export. Total number of 12 forest coffee cooperatives in remote areas of southwestern Ethiopia were certified according to Fairtrade, organic (EU standard) and Utz Certified standards. The common understanding of agricultural production in all types of organic agriculture is managing the production capacity of an agro-ecosystem. Pesticides and fertilizers are damaging human health and polluting the surrounding environment and thus violating the sustainability of ecosystem.

N2  - The review was conducted to assess the available scientific information on the role of beekeeping in improving the livelihood of the beekeeper and enhancing watershed rehabilitation. Honeybees and flowering plants have a well-developed system of interdependence. However, the rich biodiversity of Ethiopia is under serious threat from deforestation and land degradation, overexploitation, overgrazing, habitat loss, invasive species, and some water pollution. The underlying causes for these problems emanate from poverty, population growth, lack of alternative livelihoods, inadequate policy support, inappropriate investment, and inadequacy of law enforcement. More than 5 million beehives in Ethiopia have managed approximately 1.4-1.7 million farm households with 45,905 tons of honey production per year. Beekeeping is important as a strong incentive and the cheapest eco-friendly approach to promote conservation of natural ecosystems as an adjunct to conventional subsistence agriculture in the face of the growing human population and demand for land. Many countries introduced improved beekeeping as reforestation incentives, paying particular attention to plant flowering trees that provide nectar and pollen while generating income for local communities from bee products. The most serious constraint of the honey bee is the application of chemicals such as fungicides, pesticides, and herbicides, which hinder the productivity and production of honey bee colonies. Therefore, the focus should be given to those chemicals that do not harm honey bees, and the application should not match with flowering seasons to minimize the poisoning effect on the honey bee.

N2  - A salting-out assisted liquid-liquid extraction (SALLE) method followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet-visible detector (HPLC-UV/Vis) has been proposed for determination of five multiclass pesticides residues including, atrazine, ametryn, terbutryn, carbaryl and chlorothalonil from various alcoholic beverages: beer, wine and Ethiopian honey wine (<i>Tej</i>). Experimental parameters influencing the extraction efficiency of the method such as the type and concentration of salt, volume of acetonitrile (the extraction solvent) and pH of the sample were assayed and the optimum conditions were established. Under the optimum experimental conditions, matrix-matched calibration curves were constructed using beer sample as the representative matrix and good linearity over wide concentration ranges were obtained with coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>) of 0.997 or better. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of the method, which were determined as 3 and 10 times a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), were in the ranges of 1.3-3.9 and 4.5–12.8 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Precisions studied in terms of repeatability and intermediate precision (with-in lab reproducibility) at two concentration levels have demonstrated acceptable %RSD values, which were less than 10% in both cases. The applicability of the method was also investigated by analyzing various alcoholic beverages and demonstrated satisfactory recoveries in the ranges of 71-104% with their corresponding %RSDs less than 10% in all cases. The results of the study revealed that the developed SALLE method is selective and efficient sample preparation procedure prior to quantitative analysis of the target analytes by HPLC-UV/Vis.

N2  - Continuous monitoring of vector species composition, abundance, dynamics, feeding pattern, and host finding strategy is the base to determine when, what, and how control should be implemented. Thus, this study was conducted to assess entomological parameters of anopheline mosquitoes in nine villages in Seka district, southwestern Ethiopia, from June to December 2012. Mosquito collection was carried out from selected households in each of the nine study villages using light trap catches from June to December 2012. Differences in mean mosquito density, parity rates before, and after indoor residual spraying (IRS) operation were compared. In total, 1,136 adult female anopheline mosquitoes were collected during the study period. All anopheline mosquitoes collected belong to three species. Anopheles gambiae senso lato Giles was the most predominant (69.7%) followed by Anopheles coustani s.l. Laveran (22.7%) and Anopheles pharoensis Theobald (7.6%). There was significant variation in mean mosquito density among An. gambiae s.l., An. coustani s.l., and An. pharoensis. Parity rate of An. gambiae s.l. before spray operation was significantly higher than after spray operation. The highest peak biting activity of An. gambiae s.l. was between 1800 and 2100 hours. The longevity of An. gambiae s.l. ranged from 3.4 to 12.5 d. The highest vector abundance and parity rate were recorded in July and August. In conclusion, the behavioral plasticity and early biting activity of An. gambiae s.l. could affect current vector control tools (IRS and long lasting insecticidal nets). Hence, it is imperative to explore intervention tools for outdoor malaria vector control in addition to the existing IRS and long-lasting insecticidal nets.

N2  - I. AN INTRODUCTION TO SUSTAINABLE COFFEE Historically, coffee in Northern Latin America (1) was planted in the shade beneath the canopy of native trees. Besides providing richer coffee and requiring little chemical fertilizers and pesticides, canopy trees also provide farmers with additional sources of food and income, and provide habitat for migratory songbirds and other species. More recently, a trend towards growing coffee under the full sun that began in the mid-1970s, driven in part by U.S. foreign assistance, has destroyed large tracts of coffee forests and their associated biodiversity. (2) This modernization of the coffee industry has allowed increasingly large volumes of coffee to be grown at faster rates. However, modernization has also resulted in reductions of vegetative cover and species diversity of plant communities and their associated faunas, and adverse environmental impacts from the application of agrochemicals (3) on lands previously unspoiled by such applications. (4) Coffee consumers seeking to protect the flora, fauna, and small coffee growers that depend upon the traditional shade coffee plantation have been switching to certified coffee. The gourmet, or specialty, coffee industry has been subject to these social and environmental themes which were unimaginable a decade ago. As a result, organic, fair trade, bird-friendly, shade-grown, and the catchall sustainable coffees are now featured at coffee bars. (5) Buying sustainable coffee has become a way for consumers to assist in conserving biodiversity and create an income for peasant farmers (6) However, coffee consumers presently face the problem of too many different certification programs. (7) The International Coffee Organization (ICO) should take a leadership role in the certified coffee market that will result in legitimate conservation of traditional shade-grown coffee farms. Such efforts by the ICO must be supported by non-governmental environmental organizations (NGOs) that must work in concert with the ICO for a common cause. Coffee companies must also support these initiatives by agreeing to purchase sufficient amounts of certified coffee to ensure that growing such coffee is economically profitable. In addition to the ICO, NGOs, coffee companies, and their consumers, the governments of the coffee growing nations of Northern Latin America must take action to conserve shade-grown coffee farms. The Biological Diversity Convention called for its member states to endeavor to provide conditions needed for compatibility between present uses and the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components. (8) Sound national policies that protect and conserve shade coffee farms will not only benefit small farmers, the biodiversity that their plantations harbor, and the programs that certify their coffee as sustainable, but also will serve as a means for nations to achieve their in situ conservation duties under the Biological Diversity Convention, (9) as well as the principles of Agenda 21. (10) II. THE ARRIVAL OF THE COFFEE BEAN IN THE NEW WORLD Legend has it that coffee was discovered by an Ethiopian goat herder named Kaldi, who noticed that his goats were dancing and bleating excitedly after eating the red berries from a tree that he had never seen before. (11) Upon sampling the berries himself, Kaldi felt as if he were full of energy and was soon frolicking with his goats. (12) Whether this legend is true or not, coffee quickly spread to other countries from its original range in Ethiopia, and by about A.D. 1000 its popularity had soon spread throughout Arabia. (13) Venetian merchants brought coffee from Constantinople to Italy in 1615, and by 1750 it could be found through most of Western Europe. (14) By the eighteenth century, coffee had also been introduced into the fertile growing areas of the New World tropics. (15) Under colonial rule, coffee cultivation increased dramatically throughout the tropics over the following centuries. …

N2  - Smallholders in Sub-Sahara African region are the most vulnerable groups in the world. Their capacity to manage risks is especially low due to multiple stressors like drought coupled with their poor asset base. Particularly in Ethiopia, rampant crop losses due to climate change induced drought as well as weather and seasonality-based variations typically characterize the economic loss of farm households. The trend of global climate change has remained devastating and future climatic scenarios are also predicted to be pessimistic as changes in climate and weather patterns are inevitable. In spite of rapid advances in using remote sensing and simulation models, there is no clear picture of how climate variables will change. Hence, in the face of changing climate, the enhanced role of agricultural risk management should be to contribute to mitigation without compromising the role of agriculture for adaptation and food security. As adaptation to climate change is a priority for smallholders and a top agenda for development, demand-driven innovations in agricultural technologies and services are deemed for interventions. Consequently, the last several years have seen the development of innovative instruments for managing weather-related agricultural risks in which global efforts to reduce the impact of climate change on the welfare of households has significantly increased. One of the recent innovations is the index-based insurance (IBI) which was piloted in different areas in developing countries for managing agricultural risks. The preference for IBI innovations were fueled due to the fact that IBI contracts avoid the twin asymmetric information problems of adverse selection (hidden information) and moral hazard (hidden behavior). Since the indices in IBI innovations were not individual specific, but rely on external parametric measures, neither the insurer nor the insured can manipulate the functioning of IBIs in order to derive unfair financial advantage. These innovations thus explicitly target and transfer covariate risks to insurers within the contract place and period. Due to these essential characteristics and their potential for adaptation, IBIs have recently attracted the attentions of various scholars and practitioners in the insurance industry. However, almost all pilot experiments undertaken in diversified agro-ecological regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America have met unexpectedly low uptake. While the inherent problem is the prevalence of basis risk in the design of IBI products, various additional caveats were observed in terms of trust in the insurer, financial literacy and farmers’ ability to understand insurance actuaries as well as the problems of liquidity among smallholders to effect upfront premium payment. Beyond examining behavioural impediments of IBI adoption like risk and ambiguity aversion which were given less emphasis in previous studies, this thesis was mainly devoted on analysis of the uptake and impact of innovative IBI products that can overcome the longstanding problems like liquidity due to time inconsistency, trust and financial literacy. In Chapter 2, we investigated the role of risk and ambiguity aversion behaviour of smallholders in Ethiopian Rift Valley zone using lab-in-the-field experiments finding that risk aversion behaviour enhances the adoption of IBIs while ambiguity aversion deters the adoption of IBIs among smallholder farmers. In Chapter 3, we designed an innovative IBI product that postpones the premium payment, and we conducted a randomized control trial in which we exogenously vary between the standard and the innovative IBI as well as between delivery through the conventional statutory cooperative channel and the Iddir-based customary channel. In essence, these innovations help to overcome liquidity constraints and trust problems among the smallholders in deciding to purchase IBI. In addition, since premium postponement potentially invites strategic default, our experiment involves some farmers to sign legal contracts. This experiment first helped us to learn that innovative insurance products that closely address the liquidity constraints of smallholders have significant incremental uptake when channeled through Iddirs which constitute customary social institutions that bear altruistic trust. Second, we learnt that market-based index insurances and predominant indigenous social insurances can function as complementary rural risk management options. IBIs can get an avenue and trustworthiness to reach the community through informal insurances. Informal insurances also benefit from IBIs that manage covariate risks that otherwise erode informal insurances. Integrating the two reinforces (crowds-in) risk-sharing among households. In Chapter 4 and 5, we systematically measured the impact of IBIs on various categories of household welfare. First, we learned that the adoption of IBIs can help to overcome credit rationing with the implication that credit and IBIs are complementary in the functioning of rural financial markets. Second, the impact evaluation study we reported in Chapter 5 reveals that the adoption of IBI have positive effect on household farm investment. Households who adopted IBI have increased investment in high-risk high-return agricultural inputs including chemical fertilizer, improved seed variety as well as pesticide and herbicide. These findings corroborate the theory that adoption of IBIs can have ex-ante (before payout) benefits. In indemnity-based insurance, ex-ante benefits can be negative as insured agents may deliberately produce sub-optimal due to moral hazard. But since IBIs are not prone to moral hazard, IBI policy holders can realize such ex-ante benefits from their prudential investment on their insured farms. The implication is that IBI-insured households optimally exert productivity enhancing efforts. Hence, categorizing ex-ante impacts into two as positive (where insured households optimally exert output enhancing efforts) and negative (where insured households may shrink efforts to lower yields and claim payouts), we understood that IBI provides higher ex-ante benefits than indemnity insurance. Thirdly, our welfare impact assessments have shown that the adoption of IBIs increases household consumption. This consumption smoothing role of IBI is the ex-post benefits that insured households enjoy to achieve improved level of welfare compared to their non-insured counter parts. In general, the results in this dissertation evidence that IBIs are market-based innovative instruments that help to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and local weather variations on the welfare of households. Though the uptake of the product faces significant challenge due to a host of factors including basis risk, trust, liquidity and understandabaility, uptake can be improved through innovations in product design and/or through innovations in delivery channel. Overcoming the uptake challenges and offering IBIs in a larger scale helps rural households to derive a range of benefits including enhanced access to financial markets, ex-ante prudential investment in productivity enhancing high-risk high-return inputs as well as ex-post consumption smoothing and shock copying.

N2  - The study was conducted in West and East Gojjam Zones of Amhara Region Ethiopia to determine commonly used agro-chemicals and timing of applications, their effects on honeybee by itself and beekeeper farmers used cultural practices to minimize agro-chemical side effects on honeybee; Questionnaire survey methods, key informants interview and focus group discussion were used for the study. In the questionnaire survey, 384 respondent beekeepers from 4 Woredas, 20 Kebeles (376 male and 8 female) were interviewed. Descriptive, frequency with SPSS version 20 were used. The majority of farmers spray herbicides before blooming in August and insecticides at diseases and pests observed in October, November and December. Surprisingly, almost all respondents interviewed (98.7%) have confirmed that they know the negative effects of agro-chemicals on the health status and life of the honeybee. Apparently pesticides have been causing considerable damage by killing honeybees and causing yield decline due to miss use of agrochemicals. 90.9% of the non-beekeepers who use agro-chemical had no willingness to use non-chemical or alternative mechanisms to control pests and weeds. The main reported reason for the non-beekeepers not informing others about their plan to apply agro-chemicals is their laziness and jealousy; only 8.1% of respondents have willingness to use non-chemical or cultural weed and pest control mechanisms to save honeybee colonies as well as to keep their farmlands as organic. Overall the level of cooperation between beekeepers and non-beekeepers with regard to responsible use of agro-chemicals is very weak and certainly not considerate of mutual benefits and environmental protection. Essential to capacitate beekeepers in terms of technical knowledge and skills to better manage and need concerted action to develop appropriate agro-chemical application modalities that minimize side effects on honeybees and economic losses would be recommended.

N2  - This study examines vegetable producers&amp;rsquo; market participation and sales volume using cross-sectional data obtained from 385 randomly and proportionately sampled households from West Shewa zone, Oromia region of Ethiopia. Heckman two-step procedure was used to analyse the determinants of participation in vegetables markets and volume of sales during the study period. Probit model shows that education level, distance to nearest market, access to irrigation, use of pesticide and participation in any civic organization significantly affect market participation decision. Further, results from ordinary least squares regression show that sex of household head, land size, distance to farmer training centre, access to irrigation, use of pesticide and participation in civic organization significantly affect the level of market participation of the farm households in vegetable markets. The findings imply that support for female households, improving adult based education, participation in civic organization, infrastructure, access to irrigation and improved inputs are a means to increase vegetable production market participation and sales volume in West Shewa, Ethiopia.

N2  - Although substantial progress has been made over the past two decades in reducing child mortality, the fact remains that far too many children continue to die before their fifth birthday. A large proportion of these deaths—more than one-third—occur as a result of pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria. Addressing these child killers in the communities where they occur is, therefore, critical for achieving our child survival goals.  In June of this year the Governments of Ethiopia, India, and the United States, in collaboration with UNICEF, brought together over 700 government, civil society, and private sector participants from more than 80 countries to renew the global commitment to end preventable child deaths. The evidence presented at the Call to Action summit demonstrated that it is feasible for the world to greatly decrease that most outrageous of inequities—the huge gap in child mortality between the poorest and richest nations—by focusing on reaching the most disadvantaged and hardest to reach children in every country.  The program strategy addressed by the papers in this supplement, integrated community case management (iCCM), is one of the novel approaches that will help us do just that. In 2010 UNICEF released “Narrowing the Gaps to Meet the Goals,” a special report on a new study, which showed that an equity-focused approach could move us more quickly and cost-effectively toward MDG 4 & 5, with the potential of averting millions of child deaths by 2015. Training and deploying community health workers to deliver basic health services in hard to reach areas is one of the main equity-focused strategies that must be used.  However, we need more evidence on the most effective ways to implement iCCM and information on how to overcome the main barriers that impede the success of this strategy. We need to understand better the best ways to support frontline health workers and the systems they need to effectively deliver iCCM to populations without easy access to facility-based services, and to address demand-side barriers to care. There is a need for well-designed applied research to optimize delivery of these interventions at the community level and to help make these interventions more cost-effective and sustainable.  These are exactly the issues and questions that the papers in this important supplement on iCCM address. We hope that the new evidence contained in this supplement will help to inform policymakers, program managers, and all partners who are supporting scale up of community treatment programs aimed at reaching poor and disadvantaged children. It is important to note that, in addition to appropriate treatment, there is recognition that a broad inter-sectoral approach focused on effective prevention—breastfeeding, clean water, good sanitation and hygiene, immunization, insecticide-treated nets, and appropriate behavior change communication—is required for maximum impact on pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria.  We at UNICEF recognize the importance of strong partnerships and will continue to work closely with key partners as part of the global CCM Task Force to put this evidence into action. This includes the World Health Organization (WHO), Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Save the Children, Boston University, Karolinska Institutet, and others, many of whom have made important contributions to this special supplement.  UNICEF is committed to working with governments to achieve universal coverage of effective interventions and support iCCM as an essential strategy, which will foster equity and contribute to sustained reduction in child mortality. The evidence presented here will help us do just that.

N2  - Abstract Different species of Culex mosquitoes are present in high numbers in many other countries in addition to sub-Saharan Africa and Asian countries. Culex mosquitoes are serious nuisance which also transmit a range of pathogens including several viruses such as West Nile virus, Saint Louis encephalitis, and Rift Valley fever, as well as parasites such as avian malaria, and filarial worms. In Ethiopia, unlike Anopheles mosquitoes, little effort was given to study habitat, species composition, blood meal sources and insecticide susceptibility status of Culex mosquitoes. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the species composition, their blood meal source and insecticide susceptibility status of Culex mosquitoes to some of selected insecticides in Jimma town southwest Ethiopia. Culicine mosquito larvae were collected using a standard dipper (by dipping) from a range of breeding sites and reared to adults. Species identification was carried out using standard keys. Bioassay tests were performed on adults to assess the susceptibility of Culex mosquitoes to insecticide-impregnated papers with Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT (4%), mlathion (5%), bendiocarb (0.1%), propoxur (0.1%), deltamethrin (0.05%) and pirimiphos-methyl (0.25) following World Health Organization Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) guideline. Moreover, 184 blood fed (BF) Culex mosquitoes were collected using aspirator from indoor and outdoor resting and assayed to assess blood meal sources using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The result of the study showed that among the collected Culex moquitoes, two species were identified as Culex quinquefasciatus and Cx antennatus whereas the remaining one could not be identified to species level. Culex mosquitoes were found to be resistant to DDT, malathion, bendiocarb, propoxur, and deltamethrin whereas susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl. The blood meal source analysis using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) showed higher blood source of human (33.2%) than bovine (15.2%). Thus, the observed resistance to the most of the insecticides coupled with higher human blood meal source calls further studies to be carried out in Culex mosquito populations of Ethiopia.

N2  - Parthenium (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) is an invasive herbaceous weed which belongs to the family Compositae. It is believed to have originated in tropical America and now occurs widely in Asia, Australia, Southern and east Africa. Parthenium has been observed to grow on road sides, gardens, waterways, in grasslands and crop fields both during the crop season and after harvest, as long as enough moisture is available. In Ethiopia it is believed to have been introduced in the 1970s and currently covering almost all parts of the country causing up to 97% yield reduction in crop fields and 100% reduction in forage crops. The weed has become a problem for range, forest and crop lands. It grows in any soil type and in a wide range of habitats and is also known to affect animal and human health. It causes loss of bio diversity and presently it was recorded as an invasive alien weed species in Ethiopia. Suggested control measures include hand pulling, mowing and the use of herbicides. Hand pulling and mowing, however, have limited value because of the enormous amount of labor required and the sensitivity of humans to allergens produced by the weed. If herbicides are used, multiple applications are necessary. As well, appropriate herbicides are not available in all areas where the weed is a problem. Small-scale farmers may not be able to invest in management options for parthenium especially for pasture, fallow, wasteland, grazing land and road sides. Biological control using insect pests and plant pathogens in an integrated parthenium management system is one solution but not well reviewed. Key words: Parthenium hysterophorus, epidemiological factors, small scale farmers, pathogens.

N2  - Tef (Eragrostis tef) is the most important cereals in Ethiopia, is threatened by abiotic and biotic constraints.Among the biotic, tef leaf rust (Uromyces eragrostis) is one of the major constraints of tef production.Information on the occurrence and reaction of cultivars to tef leaf rust in Ethiopia was not well known.Therefore, the aim of this survey was to observe the performance of commercial cultivars and understand the distribution of major tef diseases in the country.The survey was made in 2016 main cropping seasons (in October) following the main roads and accessible routes in each survey district, and stops were made at every 5-10km intervals based on vehicles odometers as per tef fields presented.Five stops were made in each tef field by moving "X" fashion at each stop interval and data were collected from each.A total of 19 districts were covered during the survey.In each surveyed areas the incidence and severity of tef diseases were recorded.A total of 41 fields were observed in all assessed regions and all the observed fields were infected by tef leaf rust disease.The prevalent of tef leaf rust disease was 100% in all regions.The highest tef leaf rust disease severity of (60S) was observed in Gurage on lately planted tef varieties Quncho and Magna.For tef leaf rust disease this attack was unusual.From the assessed fields Quncho variety was the most popular (38%) and followed by Magna which accounts about 31% area coverage.Different severity levels were also recorded on the variety Quncho, local and Magna variety based on different agro ecologies.The current assessment indicated that the highest severity of the disease in different tef varieties and their occurrence across districts was highly variable.The disease was severe in Meskan, Sankura, Worabe and Shashemene districts with severity of 50-60S.The severity of the disease was increased because of improved agronomic practices (Row planting, late planting and cultivars) that are susceptible to disease become common and no chemical control was practiced to tef leaf rust disease so far.Currently, the disease was becoming severe and using fungicide may be an option to control this disease.The other issue is screening of germplasm to this disease and selecting those tolerant line(s) and incorporating in breeding program will also another option to control this disease in the future

N2  - Striga (witchweed) is one of the most successful parasitic weeds of cereal crops in Africa. It is ‘a poor farmer’s problem’ as there is a near perfect ecological overlap between areas of Striga infestation and where hunger prevails. It is originated in Semien hills of Ethiopia and the Nubian hills of Sudan and later expanded in about 42 African countries. Striga hermonthica, Striga asiatica, Striga gesnerioides, and Striga aspera constitute the greatest economic threat to cereal crops’ yield losses. They are obligate root parasites causing growth inhibition and yield losses of 20-100% in maize, rice, sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet, sugar cane and cowpea. Cultural practices such as long-term rotational cultivation of cereal crops with legume crops unaffected by the parasite is effective in managing the weed. Besides, biological control by use of parasitic fungi ( Fusarium oxysporum and Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza) play a role in managing the weed. In addition, chemical control with imidazolinone herbicide, ethylene gas, dicamba and 2,4-D are effective in managing striga in cereal crops in extreme cases. Integrated use of striga resistant crop varieties with water conservation practices, soil fertility amendment and use of parasitic fungi ( Fusarium oxysporum and Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhiza) is effective in control, economically safe, socially acceptable and environmentally friendly than a single control measure. Therefore, the promising integrated striga management practices should be highly promoted. Moreover, host and Striga species specific integrated Striga management should be designed.

N2  - Plant protection products (PPPs) in agriculture are regularly used to protect crops. Pesticides can be classified into a number of different types and chemical groups, including fungicides, insecticides, growth regulators, etc. The residual pesticides could pollute the environment; contaminate water, soil, and foodstuffs like fruits and vegetables, in addition to their use for pest control. These chemicals can build up and lead to major health issues. Some types of pesticides cause specific illnesses, whereas others impair liver or lung function and some simply mildly irritate the skin, some are carcinogenic. In the other way, pesticides especially insecticides are neurotoxic to both insects and people. Today, pesticides detected in several samples, including those of milk, cereal crops, coffee, and staple foods. The leftovers build up in the soil, water, cereal crops, fruits, and vegetables, among other places, and they stay there for a while. The aim of this paper was to study the presence of pesticide residues in some selected food items in Jimma areas. Although it indicates the presence of pesticide residues in the area. We advise against utilizing them or only using them when absolutely essential, at the appropriate rate, and only where they are intended. It is also recommended to assess the pesticide residue concentration levels and follow up in the food items.

N2  - Objective In Northeast Brazil, large domestic containers used to store water are important breeding sites of Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue fever. The objective of this study was to estimate the survival of Betta splendens (Perciformes: Osphronemidae) fish in domestic containers in Fortaleza (Ceará State), as well as its effectiveness in the control of premature A. aegypti stages. Methods The use of B. splendens was compared to Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) in domestic containers. In a first home visit, B. splendens or Bti were applied to water containers. Two follow-up visits were conducted after 3–4 and 5–6 months to assess the presence of viable fish in the containers and infestation by larvae. Betta splendens fish were still present in 97.6% of containers 45–60 days after application. When the fish was present, the infestation rate was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the Bti group (IR ratio = 21.60; 95% CI: 6.46–72.28). In deposits where the fish remained, efficacy was 85% better than Bti. The permanence of fish was higher in concrete tanks (48.5%) located outside the house (47.5%) and at ground level (53.3%). We conclude that B. splendens may be suitable for biological control of A. aegypti larvae in large domestic water containers, but that appropriate measures should be taken to assure prolonged survival and the presence of fish in the containers. Objectif: Dans le nord du Brésil, de grands conteneurs à usage domestique utilisés pour stocker l’eau sont d’importants sites de reproduction du moustique Aedes aegypti, principal vecteur de la dengue. L’objectif de cette étude était d’estimer la survie des poissons Betta splendens (Perciformes: Osphronemidae) dans les conteneurs à usage domestique à Fortaleza (Etat du Ceará), ainsi que leur efficacité dans la lutte contre les stades pré matures d’A. aegypti. Méthodes: L’utilisation de B. splendens a été comparée à celle de Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) dans des récipients domestiques. Dans une première visite à domicile, B. splendens ou Bti a été introduit dans les réservoirs d’eau. Deux visites de suivi ont été effectuées au bout de 3-4 et 5-6 mois pour évaluer la présence de poissons viables dans les conteneurs et les infestations par les larves. Les poissons B. splendensétaient encore présents dans 97,6% des conteneurs 45-60 jours après l’introduction. Lorsque le poisson est présent, le taux d’infestation était significativement plus élevé (p <0,001) dans le groupe de Bti (IR ratio = 21,60; IC95%: 6,46 à 72,28). Dans les dépôts où le poisson a persisté, l’efficacitéétait 85% meilleure qu’avec Bti. La persistance des poissons était élevée dans les cuves béton (48,5%), situées à l’extérieur des maisons (47,5%) et au niveau du sol (53,3%). Nous concluons que B. splendens peut être adapté pour la lutte biologique contre les larves d’A. aegypti dans de grands conteneurs d’eau domestiques, mais que des mesures appropriées devraient être prises pour assurer la présence et la survie prolongée des poissons dans les conteneurs.

Objetivo: En el nordeste de Brasil, los grandes contenedores domésticos utilizados para el almacenaje agua son importantes criaderos de Aedes aegypti, el principal vector de la fiebre del dengue. El objetivo de este estudio era estimar la supervivencia de peces Betta splendens (Perciformes: Osphronemidae) en contenedores domésticos en Fortaleza (Ceará State), así como su efectividad en el control de estadios más tempranos de A. aegypti. Métodos: Se comparó el uso de B.splendens con Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) en contenedores domésticos. En una primera visita a los hogares, se depositaron B.splendens o Bti en los contenedores de agua. Se realizaron dos visitas de seguimiento después de 4 y 5-6 meses para evaluar la presencia de peces viables en los contenedores y el nivel de infestación de larvas. Los peces Betta splendens aún estaban presentes en un 97.6% de los contenedores 45-60 días después de haber sido depositados. Cuando los peces estaban presentes, la tasa de infestación era significativamente más alta (p<0.001) en el Grupo Bti (IR ratio=21.60; 95% IC:6.46–72.28). En depósitos en donde los peces permanecían, la eficacia era de un 85% más que con Bti. La permanencia de los peces era mayor en tanques concretos (48.5%) localizados fuera de las casas (47.5%) y a nivel del suelo (53.3%). Conclusiones: B. splendens puede ser un buen control biológico de larvas de A. aegypti en grandes contenedores de agua, pero son necesarias unas medidas apropiadas que aseguren la supervivencia prolongada y la presencia de los peces en los contenedores. Palabras clave: Dengue; Aedes aegypti; control biológico; peces larvívoros; Betta splendens. Larvivorous fish have been used to control various insect vectors, such as malaria vectors in natural breeding sites (Molloy 1924; Rojas et al. 2004). For example, the fish Poecilia reticulata has been successfully used in the control of the mosquitoes Culex quinquefasciatus and Anopheles gambiae in rivers and lakes in Cuba, Sri Lanka and French Polynesia (Koldenkova et al. 1989; Garcia et al. 1991; Lardeux et al. 2002; Kusumawathie et al. 2008). Less frequently, biological control of vector mosquitoes using larvivorous fish has been performed in domestic breeding sites. Gambusia affinis, Aphanius dispar and Oreochromis niloticus were used successfully in ground tanks and wells to control Anopheles funestus and C. quinquefasciatus in India, Ethiopia and Kenya (Dixit et al. 1981; Fletcher et al. 1992; Sharma et al. 1997; Howard et al. 2007). The fish Betta splendens Regan (Perciformes: Osphronemidae) (the Siamese fighting fish) has biological characteristics that favour its use in the control of Aedes aegypti larvae in domestic containers: a high larvae-eating capacity, and the capacity to survive for a prolonged time in chlorinated water. In containers with 2 l of water, they were capable of killing an average of 319 Anopheles stephensi pupae in a single day (Gosh et al. 2004). After 5 weeks of continuous exposure to A. aegypti larvae in laboratory conditions, female B. splendens were able to eat up to 500 third stage larvae per day (Pamplona et al. 2007). Specimens of B. splendens survived at 1.0 mg/l concentration of chlorine with no apparent discomfort and 75% of them survived at concentrations of 1.50 mg/l (Cavalcanti et al. 2009). In Brazil, residual concentrations of chlorine in domestic containers range from 0.50 to 2.00 mg/l (Brasil, 2004). However, the permanence of this fish species in domestic containers with chlorinated water under field conditions has not yet been described. The Brazilian dengue control programme is based on the reduction in breeding sites and the control of immature and adult vectors of A. aegypti (Brasil, 2009). Breeding sites are reduced by the community that is mobilized through education activities aimed at families and the population in endemic areas. The control of immature and adult forms insect of A. aegypti is carried out by control agents. They place larvicides in potential domestic breeding sites at regular intervals. In addition, insecticide is applied at ultralow volume to target adult mosquitoes. In the city of Fortaleza, when this study was developed, immature forms of A. aegypti were controlled through the application of the larvicide Bti in all potential breeding sites, every 2 months, throughout the year (Brasil, 2009). At that time, there were approximately 800 000 residences in the city of Fortaleza and the Programme had more than 1000 health agents developing education activities to reduce breeding sites and control the immature forms A. aegypti. These activities, with this frequency and coverage, have been developed in the city of Fortaleza since 2001 (Municipal Health Coordinator, personal communication). Despite these great control efforts, in 2003, there was a large outbreak of dengue fever with 9012 cases and 169 haemorrhagic cases (Cavalcanti et al. 2010). Preliminary results showed that one specimen of B. splendens can eat about 500 A. aegypti larvae per day (Annual Meeting of Brazilian Society of Tropical Medicine, 2001). Afterwards, a local newspaper reported that the ‘Betta’ was very efficacious as a predator of A. aegypti larvae. As a result, the population started placing specimens of Betta fish in domestic containers on their own. In the city of Fortaleza, the fish can be purchased in shops selling ornamental fishes for aquariums. In addition, they can be fished in local lakes on the outskirts of the city (Pamplona 2006). In Northeast Brazil, the A. aegypti Control Programme of the municipality of Fortaleza, the capital of Ceará State, has used B. splendens fish in domestic containers as a biological control strategy of A. aegypti since 2001.1 The municipal Dengue Control Programme adopted this procedure as a control strategy, and in 2002, there were approximately 200 000 residential containers with Betta fish in Fortaleza (Oliveira-Lima et al. 2003). In the Northeast Brazil, especially in areas where the public water supply is intermittent, the population uses containers to accumulate water. This has been a major obstacle for the control of A. aegypti, in addition to the economical impact by consuming large amount of larvicides (Brasil, 2009). People use ground tanks because in some areas the water pressure provided by the public water supply is not enough to reach elevated tanks. Moreover, it is not possible to put permanent covers on ground tanks because the water is taken trough the tank mouth. So, B. splendens fish is particularly suitable to be use in ground tanks. The objective of the this study was to estimate the duration of time B. splendens fish survive in domestic containers under field conditions and to assess the effectiveness in the control of A. aegypti larvae compared to the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti). The city of Fortaleza is the capital of Ceará State in Northeast Brazil. It has a population of about 2.5 million and is located in the tropics, with an average temperature between 26 and 27 °C and a relative humidity of 81 ± 7%. The study was performed in the neighbourhood ‘Serviluz’ in Fortaleza. This community suffers frequent water supply outages, with the consequence that the population uses a variety of receptacles and containers for water storage. At the time of the study, Brazil’s National Dengue Control Programme (PNCD) recommended the use of the larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti). Granular formulation (Abbott Laboratórios do Brasil Ltda, IL, USA) was used and applied following indications of the PNCD (0.02 g/l) in all types of domestic water containers that cannot be eliminated every 60 days, which would mean six treatment cycles per year (Brasil, 2009). In 2001, Fortaleza’s Dengue Control Programme (PMCD) introduced in addition the use of B. splendens fish for the control of immature forms of A. aegypti in water containers with a volume >200 l. We used data collected by PMCD agents during routine field activities from October 2002 to April 2003. The Control Programme had a record, for every water container in the household, about the type of treatment (Fish or Bti) used in the previous cycle of treatment. Based on this information, containers were classified as Fish group or Bti group. On the first house study visit, containers from the Fish group were treated with a new specimen of B. splendens fish: a new specimen was placed if no fish was present in the container, or a specimen present in the container was replaced by a new one. Accordingly, the containers from the Bti group were treated with Bti at the first study visit. Subsequently, there were two follow-up visits, the first during the third or the forth month and the second between the fifth and sixth month of observation. During these visits, the presence of viable fish in the containers was checked and infestation status by immature forms of A. aegypti larvae assessed. The observation of the water container stopped when: (i) immature forms of A. aegypti were observed in the container; (ii) the Betta fish was absent; (iii) the study period had finished (censoring time). During the first visit, information about the containers was recorded regarding its type (elevated tanks or ground tanks), material (brick or cement, concrete, asbestos, plastic, metal or fibreglass), location (inside or outside the house), volume (calculated using the dimensions of the container), height above the ground and the presence of cover. Infestation of the containers was determined by the presence of immature forms of A. aegypti. The containers were inspected using a torch, and all immature forms were removed using a sweep net, placed in glass test tubes containing 75% alcohol and taken to the laboratory, where the immature A. aegypti were identified and counted. To calculate the infestation rate, the observation time was the period between the first visit and the date on which the immature forms of A. aegypti were observed, or the period between the first visit and the date of the last visit (censoring time) for those containers that never were infested. To calculate the permanence rate of the fish in the containers, the observation time was the period between the first visit and the date on which the absence of fish was observed, or the period from the first visit to the date of the last visit (censoring time) for those containers in which fish were present during all the visits. The probability of the permanence of B. splendens in the containers over time was estimated by the life table method. Permanence rate was calculated by dividing the number of containers with fish present by the sum of the observation time for the containers. Similarly, the infestation rate of containers was calculated by dividing the number of infested containers by the sum of the observation time for the containers. The association between containers’ characteristics and permanence of fish or infestation, as well as the association between containers’ characteristics and treatment (Bti or Fish) was assessed by means of permanence rate ratio and infestation rate ratio and its 95% confidence intervals, calculated through Poisson regression. Characteristics associated with infestation, in a multivariate model, with a P value ≤0.250 were considered confounders and were included in a final multivariate Poisson regression model to assess the relationship between treatment and infestation (Hosmer & Lemeshow 2000). In total, 1001 houses were inspected, and 974 large volume containers identified (>200 l). Five hundred and thirty-seven (55.1%) containers belonged to the B. splendens group and 437 (44.9%) to the Bti group. Initially, the duration of the presence of B. splendens in domestic water containers was estimated (Table 1). A high proportion (97.6%) was present at 45–60 days, and then this proportion dropped rapidly. In one container, the fish remained for at least 183 days. The characteristics of containers associated with the duration of the presence of the fish specimens were assessed (Table 2). The permanence rate was significantly longer in ground tanks (P < 0.001), in brick and cement or concrete tanks (P = 0.018), in containers situated outside the house (P = 0.038) and in those located <1 m above the ground (P = 0.002). The volume of the container and the presence of a cover were not significantly associated with the permanence of the fish. In the multivariate analysis, only the type of container remained significantly associated with the permanence of fish (adjusted incidence rate ratio = 1.99; 95% CI: 1.41–2.83; P < 0.001). Factors associated with container infestation by A. aegypti larvae were investigated to identify the potential confounders of the relationship between treatment and infestation (Table 3). The incidence rate of infestation by Aedes larvae was significantly higher in ground tanks (P < 0.001), in brick and cement/concrete containers (P = 0.008), in containers with a volume <2000 l (P = 0.013), in containers <1 m above the ground (P < 0.001) and in uncovered containers (P < 0.001). Infestation was not significantly associated with the location of the container. After adjustment, only the type of container was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with infestation. The infestation rate was 2.74; 95% CI: 1.58–4.76 times longer in ground tanks than in elevated tanks. To understand how a containers’ characteristics work as confounders, the association between containers’ characteristics and treatment was assessed (data not shown in tables). Type of deposits, material and the presence of cover were significantly associated with treatment group. Among containers from the Fish group, there was a higher proportion of ground tanks (P < 0.001), brick and cement/concrete containers (P < 0.001) and uncovered containers (P < 0.001). To estimate the relationship between treatment and infestation, not adjusted and adjusted to confounders, a multivariate analysis was performed by means of Poisson regression models (Table 4). In non-adjusted analysis, when the fish was present, the infestation rate was significantly higher (P = 0.001) in the Bti group [infestation rate (IR) ratio = 6.72; 95% CI: 2.08–21.64]. However, when the fish was not present in the container, the infestation rate was significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the Bti group (IR ratio = 0.39; 95%; CI: 0.27–0.57). Different results were obtained in the multivariate analysis. When the fish was present, the infestation rate was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the Bti group (IR ratio = 21.60; 95% CI: 6.46–72.28). In deposits where the fish remained, efficacy was 85% better than Bti. But when the fish was absent, the incidence rate was similar in both groups (P = 0.471). Our study suggests that B. splendens is more effective than the larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) as a control method of immature forms of A. aegypti. When the fish was present in a container, the incidence of immature forms of A. aegypti was 19 times lower than in containers treated with Bti. This is the first investigation of the effectiveness of B. splendens as a control strategy of immature forms of A. aegypti in domestic water containers (Pamplona 2006). This study only considered containers with a volume equal or larger than 200 l, such as ground tanks and elevated tanks and drums. In Fortaleza, these big water containers are essential to store water because the public water supply usually only reaches households for a few hours each day (Caprara et al. 2009). The use of Betta fish to control the immature forms of A. aegypti in large volume containers may have a great impact on transmission, as these containers are responsible for a big proportion of pupae (Pamplona et al. 2004; Romero-Vivas et al. 2006; Koenraadt et al. 2007). On the other hand, these large volume containers consume the biggest amounts of larvicides. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Health, in the State of Ceará alone, in 2009, US$ 4.5 million was spent on larvicides for A. aegypti control (Brasil, 2009). This cost would be reduced if the larvicide was substituted by fish (Bheema et al. 1982; Neng et al. 1987; Conejo et al. 2000; Martinez-Ibara et al. 2002; Mohamed 2003). As the selection of the type of container to receive fish or be treated with Bti was not random, this result could be confounded if factors facilitating the infestation of containers with A. aegypti were positively associated with the containers treated with Bti. However, the opposite occurred. The fish group had a significantly higher proportion of ground tanks, brick and cement/concrete containers and uncovered containers (data not shown in table). These categories of the respective variables were associated with the highest infestation rate of A. aegypti (Table 2). As expected, the adjusted odds ratio (OR = 19.69) of infestation was much higher than the unadjusted one (OR = 6.72). Up to 60 days, only 2.4% of the containers were observed without any fish. However, this proportion increased to 37.4% at the end of the third month. Thus, in the routine of the control programme, after 60 days, all containers that received fish should be examined to replace any absent fish. Sixty days are also the critical point for the residual effects of the Bti. In an experimental study with renewed water, to simulate the conditions in a domestic water container, only 38–44% of A. aegypti larvae died 60 days after the water was treated with Bti larvicide (Pontes et al. 2005, 2010). The water in domestic water containers has some characteristics which may influence the longevity of Betta fish, such as the level of nutrients and the chlorine concentration. Assuming that the water for domestic consumption has a lower concentration of organic matter than natural breeding sites, it is probable that this restriction of nutrients is a factor reducing the longevity of Betta fish in domestic water containers. Regarding chlorine, it has been demonstrated that 27.5% of the fish specimens do not resist concentrations of chlorine of 1.5 mg/l (Cavalcanti et al. 2009). In Fortaleza, the concentration of chlorine in the public water supply varies between 0.55 and 1.83 mg/l (Companhia de água e esgoto do Ceará (CAGECE), 2007). The influence of certain characteristics of containers (type, material, location, volume, height and the presence of a cover) on the longevity of Betta fish was investigated. In particular, the volume of the container may influence the survival of the Betta because this species has the habit of being in constant movement (Bronstein 1994), and consequently, in large containers they would consume more energy, leading to a greater possibility of death because of energy exhaustion. However, in our study, no significant relationship was observed between the volume of the container and the longevity of the fish. During the study’s 6 month observation, the incidence rate of Betta fish was 1.99 times higher in the ground tanks than the elevated tanks, after adjustment for other characteristics of the containers. This result has great practical importance because it is easier to monitor the presence of fish in ground tanks than in elevated tanks. In this analysis, the presence of the Betta fish in a container at any time was used as an indicator of the fish’s survival until that point. When absent, the fish was considered dead. However, a fish may be absent because it left the container through the overflow pipe or when the container overflowed. Putting a mesh over the pipe would prevent the escape of fish while preventing the overflow of water. Monitoring the fish’s presence should be continuous and might be costly and inefficient if performed by the Control Programme agents. Hence, the monitoring should be performed by the community, who would report the absence of fish to the Control Programme, which would take the necessary measures. Community participation in integrated vector control programmes has produced good results and cost reductions (Neng et al. 1987; Martinez-Ibara et al. 2002). We thank the technicians Roberto Varela, Socorro Furtado and Carlos Alberto for supervision of the fieldwork and the endemic agents of Fortaleza for their important contributions to field activities.

N2  - Abstract Abstract Helicoverpa armigera is a major threat for all cotton production areas in Ethiopia. Pests control with insecticides from a single chemistry group is common practice in most cotton farms, which may help to the development of insecticide resistance. The studies aimed to determine the susceptibility of the field population of H. armigera to pyrethroid insecticides. The experiment was carried out at Werer Agricultural Research Center under the laboratory condition using larva immersion and square dip methods. The selected insecticides were tested in seven dilutions levels. In each dilution 30 larvae of 3 rd instars, H. armigera were treated in three replications along with pure water. A low level of resistance was detected for all tested locations to alphacypermethrin and a high resistance ratio to lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin for Gewane and Werer populations. Aplhacypermethrin was the most toxic insecticide and its LC 50 was low compared to other tested synthetic pyrethroids. Whereas, deltamethrin was the least toxic insecticide with high LC 50 . The LC 50 value of the Goffa-Sawla population was significantly different among the populations for Werer, Upper-Awash, and Gewane in both bioassay methods . The study concluded that Helicoverpa armigera might have resistant to deltamethrin in Werer and Gewane populations. Further studies on the monitoring of resistance are recommended.

N2  - Agriculture is characterized by a growing use of chemicals, such as fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides that are negatively affecting human health and the environment.Despite that, the Ethiopian government promotes the use of those chemicals in an attempt to increase yield and improve farmer's livelihoods.On the other hand, environmental researchers argue that, equivalent yield can be obtained by using sustainable agricultural practices and produce safe food.Unfortunately, the "traditional" sustainable agricultural practices are being replaced by chemical intensive practices as the later is largely promoted.Therefore, it is important to trigger policy towards the promotion of "traditional" sustainable agricultural practices through research.This study, by using 299 randomly selected households from Eastern Ethiopia, unravels the factors that influence the use of crop rotation in Eastern Ethiopia.The results can serve policy makers by identifying the relevant variables and help them design successful intervention strategies.Based on the result, older age (older than 37 years), use of irrigation, distance to FTC, land size and farmers perception towards soil fertility are found to positively affect the decision to practice crop rotation.On the other hand, young age (younger than 37 years) and distance from market are found to hinder the decision of farmers to practice crop rotation.Sustainable agriculture can be brought back on track by creating a platform for older farmers to share their experiences with younger farmers and diverting some of the attention given to chemical fertilizers towards the "traditional" and sustainable practices.

N2  - As agricultural production in African countries intensifies; pesticide utilization becomes more widespread and the users are extremely exposed to these pesticides due to lack of pesticide registration scheme; importing highly toxic pesticides; no national plan for pesticide residue; involvement of children and women. The purpose of this systematic review was to review adverse effect of pesticide among top ten imported African countries. In this review, top ten importers African countries were selected based of imported amount for ten years were considered from imported period of 2002 to 2017. The articles were searched from PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, and MEDLINE and EMBASE engines. The first leading three continents for pesticides exported were European (48.2%), Asian (33.7%) and North America (12.7%), while the countries were China (14.3%), Germany (11.8%) and United States (11.5%) at the end of 2017. The first three leading importer of African countries were South Africa shared (25.7%), Nigeria (15.8%) and Ghana (14.5%). The three major imported pesticides were Fungicides, herbicides and insecticides. In this review, Ethiopia (827), Kenya (801), and Morocco (542) are the main importers of pesticides until end of 2017. The review also found that farmers were faced with endocrine disruption, carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, cardiovascular, dermatitis and birth defects. The main associated factor for these problems were low awareness, improper handling of pesticide, and lack of training, and careless disposal of empty pesticides containers. The study concluded that more than one billion US$ of pesticides sales was carried out into ten African countries. The farmers within these country were faced different health problems due to different determinant factors. Proper training and education should be advised for farmers &#x0D; Keywords: Adverse effect, African countries, Import, Pesticide

N2  - Parasitic skin disease in domestic ruminants caused by ticks, lice, fleas, and ticks is one of the serious diseases causing great economic losses to smallholder farmers, the industry tanning and the country in general. Invasion of ectoparasites causes blood loss, irritation leading to skin degeneration and rejection, poor growth, reduced production, reproduction and death. Although ruminant parasites can be controlled using commercial synthetic insecticides, their accessibility and affordability to poor farmers, the development of Their resistance status and profound environmental impact make them less desirable than other alternatives such as medicinal plants. Therefore, there is an urgent need to design an activity to evaluate the mite-killing efficacy of medicinal plants traditionally used against parasitic skin diseases in ruminants and domestic chickens in Ethiopia. The study was conducted from October 2020 to January 2021 using the different search engines. For this study, various ethno botanical and ethno medical survey reports on the ectoparasitic importance of medicinal plants, in veterinary practice conducted in Ethiopia were used. Out of a total of 102 studies, 20 were used in a systematic review. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data collected. Among the parts of ectoparasitic plants, the leaves are the most frequently used. Sharpening and grinding are the main processing methods for preparation. Phytochemicals were not detected during the search. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine the dosage, concentration of the preparation, side effects and phytochemicals present in medicinal plants.

N2  - This study aimed to measure the level of technical efficiency and sources of inefficiency for barley producers in Ethiopia. Primary data was collected from 626 smallholder farmers using a multi-stage sampling technique. The stochastic frontier model was employed to assess the efficiency level, and the result revealed a mean technical efficiency of 79.24 % and an average productivity of 2.2 tons/hectare. This result implies that the productivity of barley producers is 20.76 % behind the potential, and solving all sources of inefficiencies and proper utilization of the production variables will assure the productivity of barley producers to 2.8 tons/hectare. All the production variables, labor, seed, fertilizer, agrochemicals, oxen power, and plot size showed a positive and significant relation to the barley output. Similarly, the squared values and the interaction between production variables were also the most important variables. The inefficiency model also revealed the importance of adopting improved varieties and access to vocational training. Therefore, this study recommends implementing policies and strategies in favor of technology adoption through arranging vocational training to enhance productivity and transform the agricultural sector.

N2  - This study analyzed the determinants of technical efficiency of smallholder malt barley producers and estimated their technical efficiency in Tiyo district of Arsi zone, Ethiopia. Data were obtained from 162 randomly selected malt barley farmers. Descriptive statistics and the translog functional form of the production function simultaneously with single stage estimation approach were used to estimate the production of barley output and technical inefficiency factors. The study revealed that the average technical efficiency of the farmers in the production of malt barley is 71%. This reveals that there exists a possibility to increase the level of malt barley yield by 29% utilizing the existing local technical knowledge of efficient farmers. This further implies that it is possible to produce the same output by reducing current input utilization by 29%. The discrepancy ratio (γ), which estimates the relative deviation of output from the frontier level due to inefficiency, was about 61%. This implies that about 62% of the variation in malt barley production among the sample farmers was credited to technical inefficiency while, the remaining 38% comes due to factors outside the control of farmers. The maximum likelihood parameter estimates showed that malt barley yield was significantly influenced by the amount of fertilizers (DAP and UREA), number of oxen, labour, malt barley seed, herbicide usage and land allocated for malt barley. The stochastic production frontier model shows that experience, education status, number of oxen, land size, and extension contact significantly affected technical inefficiency of malt barley production. Therefore, attention should be given to improve the less efficient farmers following the practices of relatively efficient farmers in the area. On top of this, policies and strategies of the government should give due focus for the determinants of technical inefficiencies in malt barley production.

N2  - This study aims to analyze the technical efficiency of sorghum production by smallholder farmers in Konso district, Southern Ethiopia using cross sectional data collected from a sample of 124 sorghum producing households. Individual levels of technical efficiency scores were estimated using the Cobb-Douglas functional form, which was specified to estimate the stochastic production frontier. The estimated stochastic production frontier model indicated that input variables such as land size, fertilizer (Urea and DAP), labour, oxen power and chemicals (herbicides or pesticides) found to be important factors in increasing the level of sorghum output in the study area. The result further revealed significant differences in technical efficiency among sorghum producers in the study area. The discrepancy ratio, which measures the relative deviation of output from the frontier level due to inefficiency, was about 90%. The estimated mean of technical efficiency of the sample households was about 69%, which shows existence of a possibility to increase the level of sorghum output by about 31% by efficient use of the existing resources. Among the household specific socio-economic and institutional factors hypothesized to affect the level of technical inefficiency, age, education level, family size, off/non-farm activities, extension contact, livestock holding, plots distance and soil fertility were found to be significant in determining the level of technical inefficiency of sorghum production in the study area. Negative coefficients of education level, family size, off/non-farm activities, extension contact and soil fertility indicates that improvement in these factors results in a significant decrease in the level of technical inefficiency. Akin, positive coefficients of age, livestock holding and plots distance were found to increase households' technical inefficiency. Hence, emphasis should be given to improve the efficiency level of those less efficient households by adopting the practices of relatively efficient households in the study area. Beside this, policies and strategies of the government should be directed towards the above mentioned determinants.

N2  - In Ethiopia, sesame is mainly cultivated as a cash crop, important source of foreign exchange and income for many smallholders.Thus, improvement in production efficiency of sesame is crucial for Ethiopian economy and for smallholder farmer's livelihood.Socioeconomic, demographic and institutional factors were collected from randomly selected 385 sample households using multi-stage sampling techniques and interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire.The Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production function result shows that all input variables except land was positive and significant effect on sesame production efficiency.Labour inputs have the highest elasticity, followed by sesame seed, pesticides/herbicides and fertilizer accordingly.The model result shows that across all mean technical, allocative, and economic efficiencies estimates are 72, 49 and 35 percent respectively, implies that a substantial level of inefficiency in sesame production.Improvement of production efficiency requires availability of enough labour particularly during harvesting because of its shattering problem.Therefore, the local and regional government needs to devise mechanisms for hired labour availability in the area.Moreover, the econometric model result indicates that sesame production efficiency was positively and significantly influenced by age, education level, livestock ownership, association membership, off/non-farm income, extension contact, credit access, mobile phone ownership and training participation.The key policy implication therefore is that promoting farmer's cooperatives, address farmers in formal and informal education programs, enhancing farmer's access to financial resources through providing easy and affordable credit services, strengthen the extension services in terms of promoting livestock and crop production improving technologies are crucial.

N2  - Coffee is an important crop in Mexico. Unfortunately, coffee production has been affected by coffee leaf rust (CLR). The severity of this infection occurs with variations along the year described before in different coffee-producing regions worldwide. For Veracruz, there are available reports of weekly CLR severity, but this information is only descriptive. We analyzed variations along the year of CLR severity in Veracruz with data from municipal weekly reports provided by Mexico’s federal government phytosanitary epidemiological monitoring coffee program. We selected reports dated in 2018 from nine municipalities and after calculations of mean monthly severity values, we conducted a one-way ANOVA (months as factors) of severity data. We compared this information with other coffee-producing regions. Additionally, we explored the association of temperature, rainfall, and altitude with CLR severity using Principal Component Analysis and multiple linear regressions. Temperature and rainfall data were obtained from Mexican National Meteorological Service. We found that CLR severity in January, October, November, and December (months of harvest period) was significantly higher than values from March-June. During the harvest period, coffee plants allocate resources mainly for fruiting which competes in resources for other tasks such as defense and leaf growth, so this competition of resources can explain the positive relationship found between fruit load and CLR severity. This monthly variation of severity was similar to those reported in Chiapas, Guatemala, Colombia, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Our model (R2 = 0.401) showed a significant and negative effect of altitude and medium temperature on CLR severity, while the effect of rainfall was positive. With our study, we suggest applications of fungicides in March-June when coffee plantations are in leaf phenophase. Key words: Altitude; Coffea arabica; Hemileia vastatrix; phenophase.

N2  - Abstract Pesticide registration is an activity often not supported with proper risk assessment procedures in developing countries like Ethiopia. In this study, we tried the PRIMET (Pesticide Risks in the Tropics for Man, Environment and Trade), a tool developed to assess the risks to non-target protection goals believed to assist the pesticide registration and monitoring activities in Ethiopia. For this study, seven pesticides ( imdacloprid, difenoconazole, metalaxyl, dimethoate, thiamethoxam, nicosulfuron and bupirimate) were selected randomly and their data of physico-chemical characteristics, toxicological information and pesticide use were mined from either the information given on the dossier or PPDB (Pesticides Properties Database). Results indicated that imidacloprid , dimethoate and thiamethoxam are highly risky to bees when bee hives are present inside the field of the sprayed crop, while Thiamethoxam is highly risky at when hives are present in and off field crop situation. Another outcome was that imidacloprid and dimethoate are expected to have high acute risk for birds, while difenoconazole, metalaxyl, dimethoate showed high acute and chronic risks to the aquatic ecosystem, respectively. Future studies should give emphasis on how the results of risk assessment can be practical to help the registration processes and how the results are compared with actual measurement values.

N2  - The goal of this article was to summarize beekeeping's constraints and potential in Ethiopia. Beekeeping techniques and some of the roles of this sector in Ethiopia's economy will be covered in this article. Ethiopia is one of the countries with a large honey- producing potential in Africa. Currently, there are three main classifications of the honey production system in Ethiopia; these are traditional (forest and backyard), transitional (intermediate) and modern (frame honeycomb) systems. Despite the challenges and limitations, Ethiopia has the largest bee population in Africa with more than 10 million bee colonies, of which 5-7.5 million are clustered together while the rest exist in a state of disrepair. wild Thai. The country has the potential to produce up to 500,000 tonnes of honey annually. But currently, the production is limited to 53,000 to 58,000 tons of honey. Ethiopia has an even greater potential than the current honey production due to its many bee sources such as natural forests with a complete bee system, water resources and a high number of existing bee colonies. Lack of a well-trained workforce, honey bee pests and diseases, high cost and limited availability of modern beekeeping equipment and inappropriate use of pesticides are some of the main constraints hindering the profession. Ethiopian beekeeping reaches its full production potential. Beekeeping plays an important role in increasing and diversifying the income of smallholder farmers in Ethiopia, especially those who have small plots of land and landless. To significantly improve the beekeeping sub-sector, the government and relevant development partners must collaborate to organize and promote forums on how to improve this industry and realize its full potential.

N2  - Wheat is the fourth most important staple food crop in Ethiopia and grown in a wide range of agro-ecology. It accounts more than 15% of the total cereal output. The country is the second largest wheat producer in sub-Sahara Africa, and the crop is becoming a key strategic crop for improving food security. However, the national average yield is 2.73 tones/ha, which is far less than from the potential yield of 8 to 10 tones /ha. This low productivity of wheat in Ethiopia is attributed to a number of factors, including biotic (diseases, insect pest and weeds) and abiotic (moisture, soil fertility and etc.). Among biotic factors stripe rust disease is the most series and wheat production bottle necks issue in the country. And in most wheat-producing areas, yield losses caused by stripe rust ranged from 2.7 to 96.7% depending on the degree of susceptibility of the cultivar, timing of the initial infection, rate of disease development, areas of hotspot and duration of disease. Despite its occurrence and distribution much still needs to be understood about its impact and management options of the disease. As a result, this review work was initiated to provide wakefulness and show the present threats of wheat stripe rust disease in Ethiopia. And the review was carried out from associated journals, theses, books and research papers. This review result revealed that knowledge gap, lack of attention, lack of coordination among Regions, Zones, Districts and Sectors, Shortage of resistant varieties and high fungicide price are some of the identified reasons in Ethiopia for the disease to occur regularly and epidemically as well. As the result of this, every year there is more than 10% yield loss (275,000 tones) that costs 94, 795 millions of US dollars. However, during epidemics the loss is much higher than this. Consequently, the disease is considered as one of the constraints for the country not to produce sufficient amount of wheat grain. As a result, in each year the country is imposed to continue importing millions of quintals of wheat grain from abroad that demands high foreign currency. Therefore, this review result conclude that to overcome this challenge the country has to implement more efforts in developing an effective and efficient wheat stripe rust management strategy.

N2  - Abstract Background In Ethiopia, despite improvements in coverage and access, utilization of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) remains a challenge. Different household-level factors have been identified as associated with LLIN use. However, the contribution of LLIN physical integrity to their utilization is not well investigated and documented. This study aimed to assess the association between the physical integrity of LLINs and their use. Methods This study employed a nested case-control design using secondary data from the Ethiopian LLIN durability monitoring study conducted from May 2015 to June 2018. LLINs not used the night before the survey were identified as cases, while those used the previous night were categorized as controls. The physical integrity of LLINs was classified as no holes, good, acceptable, and torn using the proportionate hole index (pHI). A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model was used to assess and quantify the association between LLIN physical integrity and use. The model specifications included binomial probabilistic distribution, logit link, exchangeable correlation matrix structure, and robust standard errors. The factors included in the model were selected first by fitting binary regression, and then by including all factors that showed statistical significance at P -value less than 0.25 and conceptually relevant variables into the multivariate regression model. Results A total of 5277 observations fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Out of these 1767 observations were cases while the remaining 3510 were controls. LLINs that were in torn physical condition had higher odds (AOR [95% CI] = 1.76 [1.41, 2.19]) of not being used compared to LLINs with no holes. Other factors that showed significant association included the age of the LLIN, sleeping place type, washing status of LLINs, perceptions towards net care and repair, LLIN to people ratio, economic status, and study site. Conclusion and recommendation LLINs that have some level of physical damage have a relatively higher likelihood of not being used. Community members need to be educated about proper care and prevention of LLIN damage to delay the development of holes as long as possible and use available LLINs regularly.

N2  - Abstract Spodoptera frugiperda is an economical pest affecting Uganda’s agriculture. These pests are voracious feeders, polyphagous in nature and mostly affect the cereal crops such as maize and wheat which is the staple food of Africa and Uganda in particular, thus pause a threat to Africa’s food security. Ugandan farmers largely depend on synthetic pesticide to control FAW, however these have negative impacts on the environment such as water pollution, death of beneficial organisms such as bees, and development of pesticide resistance, and are toxic to human beings and the aquatic life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bioactivity of Tephrosia vogelii and Azadirachta indica leaf extracts as botanicals against Spodoptera frugiperda under laboratory conditions. The selected botanicals were subjected to phytochemical screening to examine presence of pesticide phytochemical groups of namely; flavonoids, saponnins, terpenoids, alkaloids, tannins and glycosides as highlighted by different literature Fourth instar larvae were collected from established fields in south western Uganda where there was no application of pesticides before and then n transferred to the biology laboratory of Mbarara University of Science and Technology under the faculty of science where they were reared to obtain enough study populations(second instar generation). Aqueous plant extracts were applied in varying combinations as treatments, the percentage mortality rates were recorded at 12 hours interval for 48 hours after treatment. Sterile tap water and cypermethrin were used as negative and positive controls respectively. The tested treatments of the botanicals were mixed in a combination of T.vogelii &amp; A. indica powder extract weight per volume respectively, where treatment A(20g:10g), B(10g:20g), C(15g:15g), D(30g T.vogelii only) &amp; E(30g A. indica only) and a positive control of cypermethrin. Results showed that treatments A, D and the positive control had a higher percentage mortality (&gt; 50%, p &gt; 0.05) after 48hours of application compared to treatments B, C and E that had a lower percentage mortality below (&lt; 50%, p &lt; 0.05). The botanical treatments that showed higher mortality percentage against FAW larvae contained more of the T.vogelii extract, this can be used as an extract in most of the botanicals against the FAW larvae. As an alternative, smallholder farmers can include botanicals in their integrated pest management systems around Uganda and East Africa at large conditions in Ethiopia and elsewhere in Africa.

N2  - Abstract This study is intended to scrutinize the technical efficiency of large scale grain crop producers in North West Ethiopia. Moreover, the study endeavored to determine socioeconomic characteristics, and farm management practices which influence the technical inefficiency in large scale grain production. Multiple stages random sampling technique was used to select 200 producers. The empirical results revealed that capital, labor, land, and seed input affect the output positively. The responsiveness of yield shows that a one-percent increase in utilization of capital, labor and land inputs will increase the grain production by 0.18%, 0.23% and 0.56% respectively, while, the agrochemical input influences the output negatively. Evidences from the technical inefficiency model shows that gender and levels of education variables increase technical efficiency. Age, occupation, district, and subsidies variables increase technical inefficiency. Producers’ technical efficiencies range from 23 to 100% and the mean technical efficiency is 71.7%. More effort should be made for adult and continuing education. Female producers should be given an opportunity in the management place in the large scale grain farming segment. In addition, the government is compelled to give strategies about proper input appliance and set up the pilot research institution in the study area.

N2  - Jeffrey D. Sachs is the Director of The Earth Institute, Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development, and Professor of Health Policy and Management at Columbia University. He is also Special Advisor to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. From 2002 to 2006, he was Director of the UN Millennium Project and Special Advisor to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the Millennium Development Goals, the internationally agreed goals to reduce extreme poverty, disease and hunger by the year 2015. Sachs is also President and Co-Founder of Millennium Promise Alliance, a non-profit organization aimed at ending extreme global poverty. He is widely considered to be the leading international economic advisor of his generation. For more than 20 years Professor Sachs has been in the forefront of the challenges of economic development, poverty alleviation and enlightened globalization, promoting policies to help all parts of the world to benefit from expanding economic opportunities and wellbeing. He is also one of the leading voices for combining economic development with environmental sustainability, and as Director of the Earth Institute leads large-scale efforts to promote the mitigation of human-induced climate change. In 2004 and 2005, he was named among the 100 most influential leaders in the world by Time magazine. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan, a high civilian honour bestowed by the Indian Government, in 2007. Sachs lectures constantly around the world and was the 2007 BBC Reith Lecturer. He is author of hundreds of scholarly articles and many books, including New York Times bestseller The End of Poverty (Penguin, 2005). Sachs is a member of the Institute of Medicine and is a Research Associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Prior to joining Columbia, he spent over 20 years at Harvard University, most recently as Director of the Center for International Development. A native of Detroit, Michigan, Sachs received his BA, MA and PhD degrees at Harvard University. He has been conferred with honorary doctorates from universities around the world for his extraordinary contributions in global economics, including one conferred by his close colleague Chancellor Mary Robinson from the University of Dublin, Trinity College. Jeffery Sach’s presentation on his book An End to Poverty to his colleagues in Columbia University was relayed as a keynote video presentation to set the context for the Global Congress and the 14 working groups. Only some of the moving images he presented are included in his keynote address. See: http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/media/05/349_the_end_of_poverty/. Poverty will not be ended by sheer will power alone. It will not even be ended by ethical commitment alone, though ethical commitment is essential. It will be ended by bringing the best of our thinking and the best of our science, together with ethical commitment to attend to the very great problems of the world. It will require the thinking of scholars and scientists and committed practitioners from across the range of human knowledge. The Earth Institute is a unique place in the world; it brings together scientists, engineers, public health specialists and even a few economists to think, with the knowledge that they have the support and confidence of this university community. So I want to say how grateful and pleased I am to have this forum to introduce these ideas. I think we can do something marvellous in our generation. I think we can do something that no other generation in history could even contemplate. Not only do I think that we can do this marvellous thing, I think we must do it. This wonderful thing that I think we can do is to bring an end to extreme poverty on the planet and it can be accomplished by the year 2025. I would like to explain this first by introducing you to some of the people that I have been privileged to meet. I will show you some of the haunting images that I have experienced in many years of work in very poor places. This is the face of extreme poverty. We have to understand it. Before I saw these people and their circumstances, I could not have imagined it. Still, after 20 years working with these villages in all parts of the world, I continue to experience dreadful conditions I could not have imagined before. Nevertheless, horrific as the problems are, solutions are also at hand. The solutions can be found by a proper diagnosis of the causes of such poverty and suffering, and a proper understanding of the forces at play that have led to the fact that five-sixths of the world has escaped from extreme poverty. All of the world was once in extreme poverty. Not so long ago, perhaps less than 200 years ago, there were only a few dukes, duchesses, kings and queens that were beyond extreme poverty. The rest of our forebears were fighting for survival every day. We have had a scientific and industrial revolution. We have had two centuries of economic development (albeit at times violent and frighteningly unfair, and sometimes grotesquely exploitative), which were successful in raising living standards, in raising life expectancy, and in cutting sharply mortality and illness from infectious disease. But although that progress has reached a substantial number of people, it has not reached all on the planet. The success of global economic development in most of the world makes it possible for us to think of the one billion people who have not been part of that success. One-sixth of humanity continues to struggle daily for survival. Their extreme poverty is so forceful that it literally kills. It continues to kill by the millions each year because extreme poverty deprives people of access to the most basic tools for staying alive: safe drinking water, basic sanitation, a bed net to fight against malaria, a doctor in the case of a dreaded illness that is otherwise treatable, seeds, so that crops can be grown and hunger alleviated. This deprivation is extreme poverty and a billion people on the planet are still struggling with it. Meet some of them. In our travels we saw what our fellow human beings had to endure. There were regions where crops failed due to long dry seasons and erratic rainy seasons, and this was a year when the rains failed. One poignant example was a grandmother and her extended family of grandchildren but not her own children. They had had died of AIDS and left her many grandchildren without parents. In that village we saw very few mothers and fathers of working age; a community of grandmothers and orphaned grandchildren with a missing generation. They are hungry and they are fighting every day, at risk of malaria, a killer disease. Malaria will claim between 1 and 3 million lives this year, even though it is 100% treatable if you get the medicine in time. Moreover, it is largely preventable, if you sleep under a bed net treated with insecticide. These children do not sleep under such a bed net; as they cannot afford it. A bed net costs $5, it lasts 5 years, two children sleep under it. It therefore costs a mere 50 cents per child per year, and still the poorest cannot afford it. They have no money whatsoever. They grow crops but not enough even to feed themselves. This is in essence a non-cash economy for hundreds of millions of people. Carol Bellamy, the Head of UNICEF, called the situation in Malawi, ‘the Perfect Storm’: AIDS, endemic malaria, drought – a triple catastrophe. We saw this child (Fig. 1) in a subdistrict hospital in Western Kenya just 3 weeks ago. There is a tongue depressor in the mouth so that the child would not bite his tongue off. The child, most likely, had been given medication that does not work any longer due to the development of widespread drug resistance. These former first-line drugs are now often useless. You have children brought in a state of coma as this young boy was. We do not know whether he survived. We do not know whether he will live with lifetime impairment if he did survive. Child suffering from cerebral malarial, in seizure, admitted to hospital. When we turned the corner in this subdistrict hospital, we saw the paediatric unit – six people sleeping to a bed: three children and their three mothers. This is considered normal in Western Kenya. The burden of illness is so great that the hospitals are overflowing. Malaria, killer diarrhoeal disease, acute respiratory infection, paediatric AIDS are all rampant there. There is one nurse for every 70 patients. Think about that. It is about 5 min per patient for a nurse during a day shift. And these are not patients with mild problems. This is a system completely overwhelmed. Figure 2 shows an adult ward on a not so busy day. There were, after all, only two patients to a bed. How would you like to go into the hospital with malaria and be put on a bed shared with someone with tuberculosis? Not a very good idea. In a proper hospital, the TB Ward would be separated physically. You would not be sharing a room, or hallway, much less a bed! You would be in a different part of the hospital protected by ultra-violet lights. There would be another thing that you would expect: that the doctor would wash his hands between patients. You might expect running water in the hospital. In this hospital there is no running water. They cannot afford it. Only now, are they beginning to put it in. Two patients to a bed in a crowded hospital; one of them is suffering from malaria; the second is infected with active tuberculosis. The image in Fig. 3 is, of course, one of the picturesque sights you see anywhere in Africa, with this woman carrying water on her head - except when you stop to ponder the extreme poverty. Talk to the woman. You will find out that she might spend 6 h a day simply collecting water – not safe water, mind you, but water. An hour there, an hour back, three times a day. That is extreme poverty; a rite of continuing physical burden just to stay alive. Then we hear of their work ethic and such comments as, ‘they do not work hard enough’, when in fact they work to fight for their very survival and also the survival of their children day in and day out. A woman bears a water vessel for her family which may require her to walk for several hours; repeated two or three times every day of her life. Unfortunately this water is often contaminated. That is a good picture of a bad situation. That is a woman in a hut with particles in her lungs from a typical three stone cooking stove. This is what the air is like inside the hut at cooking time. This is why millions of children get acute respiratory infection and a vast number die each year, because the air inside is too noxious for the lungs; even in their own homes they are at serious risk every day from contaminants. Figure 4 belongs to the category –‘I cannot believe what I just saw!’ Even after 20 years of thinking that you have seen everything something even more appalling turns up. This was just 2 weeks ago. This is a picture of a group of men in a village in Tigray Province, Ethiopia, digging in the middle of a dry river to find the water which is about 5 feet under the surface of the river bed. This is what the village calls, their ‘perennial river’, in other words the year-round flowing river. The only problem is that it has stopped being a river. The water table is now beneath the river bed, partly because the rains have failed consistently in recent years. The short-season rains have now failed 5 years in a row. There are 11 000 people at this bend of the river where we were. They are fighting for their very survival. Their children are chronically undernourished, and it is a struggle to stay alive, to the point of digging for water in the dry river bed. This is extreme poverty – almost unimaginable until one sees it, and so horrific that one may be led to the false conclusion, as many are, that this suffering is now inevitable: a Malthusian catastrophe as human population has simply outstripped the carrying capacity of the land. Villagers dig to find water which is fundamental to the survival of their community. What can one possibly do? The fact of the matter is that everything that we have seen has practical, do-able, known proven solutions. We just do not apply those solutions, at least not anywhere close to the scale that is needed. The point of my book, The End to Poverty, is to explain that as horrific and shocking as it is that nearly 10 million people will die this year of diseases and health conditions and the chronic under-nutrition of extreme poverty, these problems have practical solutions. I believe the Earth Institute and the UN Millennium Project have played a vital role in creating awareness and showing a way forward. What do we know? Let us start with what we think we know, as it happens to be wrong. We think we know that there is a one-word explanation for this problem. If you ask virtually anyone in Washington what is going on in these horrific scenes, they will tell you it is easy, it is corruption. This is the very convenient and typical way in which rich people talk about poor people. Such comments emanate from people who have not, even once in their lives, visited an African village. They sit in all those buildings in Washington making stereotypical judgments and decisions. Something else is very important, and more to the point. The poorest of the poor live in the most marginalized physical environments on the planet. There are objective reasons that help to account for why they have not escaped from poverty while others have. There are three underlying risk factors. Why is Africa hungry and Asia not? First, Africa, unlike Asia, did not have a Green Revolution. There are many reasons. One of the reasons is that Asia has its great rivers, including the Ganges, the Indus, the Brahmaputra, the Mekong and the Yangtze, which serve to irrigate tens of millions of farms. Unfortunately Africa depends instead on rain-fed agriculture, without the vast river systems to provide irrigation. An astonishing 96% of the Africa’s cropland is rain fed. This results in extremely fragile farm systems which make it financially hazardous for the poorest farmers to purchase fertilizers and high-yield seeds. Their extreme poverty also prevents them from getting credits to buy inputs even when they would like to do so. The results are catastrophic. Without fertilizers, high-yield seeds and irrigation, the result is low and unreliable crop yields, and the depletion of soil nutrients which are not replaced by chemical fertilizers. So now, hundreds of millions of peoples in tens of millions of farm households are dependent on farming on soils that are biophysically deficient and cannot produce enough food to keep those families alive, much less to earn a market income. However, knowing these facts also helps us to find a solution. Fertilizer and small-scale irrigation techniques (many of which rely on harvesting rainwater, and then using the rainwater for supplemental irrigation) can change the face of Africa, as improved farm inputs have changed the face of Asia. A Green Revolution is now possible in Africa as it was in Asia. However, as happened in Asia, such a revolution has to be fostered; it will not just happen by itself. The study underpinning the UN Millennium Project has shown that Africa not only has a harder time growing food, it also faces a disease burden vastly greater than other parts of the world, malaria being the most notable. There are many ecological reasons for this, such as the kind of mosquitoes that thrive in such a climate, as well as the high temperatures which result in a higher intensity of disease transmission. Moreover there are also severe transportation problems. The distances of populations from ports and navigable rivers are far greater in Africa than in most other parts of the world. What, then, are the lessons to be derived from the challenges of food production, disease control and transport? The key point is that there are identifiable explanations for why the poorest of the poor are caught in a trap of extreme poverty, infectious diseases, hunger, low food yields and economic isolation. Each one of them has a ready list of practicable solutions which can overcome the challenge. Malaria can be controlled, indeed completely treated. Yet it has trapped the poorest of the poor because they are too poor, in fact, to finance the steps needed to control the disease. People far from the coasts are poor because they cannot trade; and because they are poor they cannot finance road construction to facilitate the access necessary for international trade. Farmers are impoverished because their soils are depleted of nutrients and the rains are unstable and unpredictable, yet the farmers lack the creditworthiness to invest in better seeds, fertilizers, irrigation pumps and the like. I propose there is a way out of the poverty trap. I learned the approach from my wife, an excellent clinician who was wise enough not to go into economics! She went into paediatrics and I have watched for >20 years how she skilfully performs a differential diagnosis. When a patient calls with a fever she does not say, ‘well you were corrupt.’ Nor does she say, ‘you have an earache.’ A good doctor knows there are 50 or more reasons for fever and that the key step is to figure out which of these possibilities applies to a particular patient at a particular time. My wife takes the time to listen to the patient’s symptoms, to observe the clinical symptoms, and to carry out a differential diagnosis to find the underlying causes of the patient’s fever. The first question is ‘Is your neck stiff?’, because if it is the underlying condition might be meningitis, and the patient must get to the emergency room before the second question. If the doctor can rule out meningitis, then the task is to keep ruling out other possibilities until an accurate diagnosis can be made. We have to do better in economics. We have to do better in the practice of economic development. We have to put development on a scientific basis. We economic development specialists also need to learn to be good clinicians. We do not need a 1-page textbook telling us that all is due to corruption. We need 32 chapters: one for mountain economies, one for rain-fed agriculture, one for depleted soil nutrients and one for malaria ecology. When you look at the last 10 000 International Monetary Fund documents the word ‘malaria’ was hardly, if ever, mentioned. Quite simply, the development institutions are not yet doing serious analyses. So how can we do serious clinical economics? You must start, like a doctor, by taking a ‘history’ of the village. You learn a lot by talking to very smart yet impoverished people, who are completely aware of their dire situation and who will join you in problem-solving in order to identify effective ways out of their poverty. In Ethiopia, thousands of people came to greet us last month, to talk with us about the real challenges of extreme poverty in one of the most desperately poor, but also one of the most dignified and wonderfully welcoming, places on the planet. We met the committees and the councillors who make decisions. When you do that, you can identify together lots of practical solutions. This is a picture of our wonderful star mechanical engineer, Vijay Modi, who has solved one problem after another regarding water pumps, cook stoves, household illumination and many other practical things that need to be performed. Follow Vijay, and you will discover many simple solutions, for rainwater harvesting, safe and efficient cook stoves, low-cost illumination, new energy sources and much more. Such simple and inexpensive tools as a treadle pump have made enormous contributions in Ethiopia when the water table is high enough. But they cannot afford it on their own. We have been moved by the many examples of benefits of replenishing the soils with nutrients, both chemical and organic; in some cases using nitrogen-fixing tree crops. We have been shown bumper harvests that can be achieved when the soil nutrients are replenished. Simple and uncomplicated water control and retention techniques can be very effective. Such innovations, for example using rocks to dam rain water, can save precious soil from erosion when the water rushes down from the mountains. Simple interventions can make a huge difference. The community asked us for some mesh to keep the rocks in place so that the stones do not get washed away by the mountain streams. The mesh they needed is not that expensive but they were unable to afford it because of its relative expense. School attendance can skyrocket through interventions as simple as school meals. In one community in Western Kenya, the school was ranked near the bottom in the district in the eighth-grade national examination. School meals were introduced and the school performance soared. The school is now ranked fourth in the district and the headmistress says ‘if you feed children, they can pay attention, they can learn and they come to school.’ With locally produced food, we will able to help this community expand the number of children in the school-feeding programme. This is something that should be performed in thousands of villages around the world. Mid-day school meals pay wonderful dividends in terms of healthier children, better learning, and higher school attendance and completion rates. One very simple and inexpensive malarial preventive strategy is to use nets to protect against mosquitoes, the vectors of the disease. Nets which cost $5 are pre-treated with insecticide that will last for four or five years without the need for retreatment. The number of deaths from malaria could be reduced by a million within the next 2 or 3 years by a mass distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets and by access to effective medications. The arrival of anti-retroviral medicines in many subdistrict hospitals has been very exciting. As a result, HIV/AIDS patients will not be dying abandoned in their huts, but will get medicine and be up soon and back to their families. It costs about 30 cents a day now to treat AIDS with an anti-retroviral fixed dose combination, and every infected individual ought to be getting this. We started 21 years too late. It is been a heck of a fight. It is inexcusable that we are not scaling up the fight against AIDS even more rapidly than we are. Figure 5 shows a building under construction and is a marvellous demonstration of what a community can achieve. We said to the villagers in Sauri, Kenya, that we would provide a doctor and medicines. They said they also wanted a new clinic, and in 5 weeks the community put up the new clinic! The Millennium Village Project provided the cement and the wiring and the community built the rest. Now the village has a clinic and a doctor and an ability to treat the children and the parents in this village. This is a picture of the community health workers, who, when we asked them ‘How can we help you?’, responded: ‘We want you to train us better, so that we can be proper community health workers.’ And they are now studying, working hard and upgrading their skills. They want to stay alive and they want to keep the village children alive. Construction of a new hospital exemplifying what can be achieved. What are the lessons? The main lesson is we must understand that we are dealing with other human beings; we must understand that we are dealing with people fighting for their lives; we must understand that we are dealing with people whose first objective is not to take our money but to keep their children and themselves alive. We must understand that we are dealing with people who know and understand their situation and who have creative ideas, knowledge, experience, skills and commitment. We are dealing with people who in the midst of an AIDS pandemic and chronic hunger, can put all of their recent eighth-grade class through success in the eighth-grade national examination. Yes, these people are fighting for their children and their children’s futures. They do not need much. My book shows financial estimates of what would be needed to address the basic needs of the poorest of the poor, and to do so in a way that helps them to get on the ladder of economic development. We can help create a situation where these communities can grow enough food to feed themselves and bring a crop surplus to market. Indeed, we can help these communities to shift some farmland to high-value cash crops. We can also help to introduce other kinds of activities, such as furniture making, food processing, metal working, selling milk and honey, and many other activities that would put these communities on to the first rung of the development ladder. The cost of these solutions turns out to be so shockingly small that it is almost unimaginable. For 35 years, the rich world has promised that it would give 0.7% of our incomes to help the poorest of the poor. That means we have promised that we would give 70 cents out of every $100 for development assistance. Imagine only 70 cents out of $100. Most Americans think we do 20 times more. They do not know that we only give 17 cents out of every $100! This year, the USA will spend $650 billion on the military and only $5 billion for all of Africa. The rich world is so badly failing to honour its own aid commitments and it is so dangerously directing its overseas efforts to military means rather than peaceful development, that the world is becoming more dangerous, more unstable and more divided. The USA pledged to make efforts to reach 70 cents out of $100 in official aid. The US Government denies that we ever made any commitment, but we did, in the Monterrey Consensus agreed in 2002, at a meeting in Mexico personally attended by President Bush. Specifically, Paragraph 42 of the Monterey Consensus says, ‘We urge developed countries [and that means us] that have not performed so, to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7% of the Gross National Product in official development assistance.’ If we, the Europeans, the Japanese and other rich countries would simply follow through on our commitment we could resolve the consequences of global poverty. Our generation can give the greatest gift to our children and to our new century, i.e. that we can realistically foresee the end of poverty in our time.

N2  - Ethiopia remains a net importer of soybean partly due to low average yields which may be improved by inoculation with rhizobia and/or plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). The functional characterisation of 231 rhizobacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of soybean grown in 102 soils collected from different pedo-climatic regions of Ethiopia was carried out. Isolates were initially characterised by Gram staining and then functionally for: indole-3-acetic acid production; phosphate solubilisation; growth on a nitrogen-free medium; and, resistance to the pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum. A sub-set of 72 of the best performing isolates were tested in vitro for: production of bioprotectants; polysaccharide degradation; and their relative capacity to maintain growth in response to extremes of: temperature; pH; salinity; antibiotics; pesticides; and, heavy metals. Twenty isolates with the best PGPR potential were identified via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Seventeen isolates were Gram-negative: Pseudomonas (7); Stenotrophomonas (5); Acinetobacter (3); Enterobacter (1); and Achromobacter (1). Gram-positive types were: Bacillus (2); and, Microbacterium (1). Of the six of the most promising PGPR tested on soybean plants, Achromobacter and Acinetobacter significantly enhanced soybean seed germination, seedling growth and plant vigour index compared to non-inoculated plants. Key words: Soybean, Ethiopia, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), seedling vigour. &nbsp

N2  - Across sub-Saharan Africa, the agricultural sector remains critical to local and regional economies. It is the basis for food security and an important source of employment, particularly for women. Yet, studies consistently find that female farmers have lower rates of agricultural productivity than male farmers. Based on original research in five countries (Ethiopia, Malawi, Rwanda, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania), this policy brief shows that gender gaps in agricultural productivity do not arise because women are less efficient farmers but because they experience inequitable access to agricultural inputs, including family labour, high-yield crops, pesticides and fertilizer. Equalizing women’s access to agricultural inputs, including time-saving equipment, and increasing the return to these inputs is therefore critical to close gender gaps in agricultural productivity. It also promises to yield important economic and social gains. Across the five countries, it could raise crop production by up to 19 per cent, boost agricultural and overall GDP and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty.

N2  - Objective To assess the impact of a small-scale irrigation scheme in Ziway area, a semi-arid area in the Central Ethiopian Rift Valley, on malaria transmission. Method Parasitological, entomological and socio-economic studies were conducted in a village with and a village without irrigation. Blood smear samples were taken from individuals during the dry and wet seasons of 2005/2006. Socio-economic data were collected from household heads and key agricultural and health informants through interviews and questionnaires. Larval and adult mosquitoes were sampled during the dry and short wet seasons of 2006. Female anopheline mosquitoes were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for blood meal sources and sporozoite infections. Results Malaria prevalence was higher in the irrigated village (19%, P < 0.05) than the non-irrigated village (16%). In the irrigated village, malaria prevalence was higher in the dry season than in the wet season while the reverse occurred in the non-irrigated village. Households with access to irrigation had larger farm land sizes and higher incomes, but also higher prevalence of malaria. Larval and adult abundance of the malaria vectors, Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles pharoensis, was higher in the irrigated than in the non-irrigated village throughout the study period. Furthermore, the abundance of An. pharoensis was significantly higher than that of An. arabiensis during the dry irrigated period of the year. Canal leakage pools, irrigated fields and irrigation canals were the major breeding habitats of the two vector mosquitoes. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection rates of 1.18% and 0.66% were determined for An. arabiensis and An. pharoensis in the irrigated village. Peak biting activities of the vectors occurred before 22:00 h, which is a source of concern that the effectiveness of ITNs may be compromised as the mosquitoes feed on blood before people go to bed. Conclusion Irrigation schemes along the Ethiopian Rift Valley may intensify malaria by increasing the level of prevalence during the dry season. To reduce the intensity of malaria transmission in the small-scale irrigation schemes currently in operation in Ethiopia, year-round source reduction by using proper irrigation water management, coupled with health education, needs to be incorporated into the existing malaria control strategies. Objectif: Evaluer l'impact d'un régime d'irrigation à petite échelle dans la région de Ziway, une zone semi-aride dans la vallée du Rift dans le centre de l'Ethiopie, sur la transmission de la malaria. Méthode: Des études parasitologiques, entomologiques et socio-économiques ont été conduites dans un village avec et un village sans irrigation. Des frottis d'échantillons de sang ont été obtenus des personnes pendant les saisons sèches et humides de 2005/2006. Les données socio-économiques ont été recueillies auprès des chefs de ménage et des informateurs clés agricoles et de la santé au moyen d'interviews et de questionnaires. Des larves et des moustiques adultes ont étééchantillonnés au cours de la saison sèche et de la courte saison humide de 2006. Les moustiques anophèles femelles ont été testés par ELISA pour les sources d'origine du sang et pour les infections à sporozoaires. Résultats: La prévalence de la malaria était plus élevée dans le village irrigué (19,2%; P < 0,05) que dans le village non-irrigué (16,0%). Dans le village irrigué, la prévalence de la malaria était plus élevée pendant la saison sèche que pendant la saison des pluies alors que l'inverse était observé dans le village non-irrigué. Les ménages ayant accès à l'irrigation avaient des terrains agricoles de plus grandes tailles et des revenus plus élevés, mais aussi une plus forte prévalence de malaria. Une abondance de larves et d'adultes des vecteurs de la malaria, An. arabiensis et An. pharoensisétait plus élevée dans le village irrigué que dans le non-irrigué tout au long de la période étudiée. En outre, l'abondance d'An. pharoensisétait significativement plus élevée que celle d'An. arabiensis durant la période sèche irriguée de l'année. Les canaux de fuites des bassins, les champs irrigués et les canaux d'irrigation étaient les principaux habitats de reproduction des deux moustiques vecteurs. Des taux d'infection à sporozoïtes de P. falciparum de 1,18% et 0,66% ont été déterminés pour An. arabiensis et An. pharoensis dans le village irrigué. Le pic des activités de piqûre des vecteurs a eu lieu avant 22h00, ce qui est une source de préoccupation que l'efficacité des moustiquaires à insecticide pourrait être compromise car les moustiques se nourrissent de sang avant l'heure de coucher des gens. Conclusion: Les systèmes d'irrigation dans la vallée du Rift éthiopien pourraient intensifier la malaria en augmentant le niveau de prévalence au cours de la saison sèche. Afin de réduire l'intensité de la transmission de la malaria dans les petits systèmes d'irrigation à petite échelle actuellement en opération en Éthiopie, une réduction des sources tout au long de l'année par l'utilisation d'une gestion appropriée des eaux d'irrigation, associée à l'éducation sanitaire, doit être intégrée dans les stratégies existantes de lutte contre la malaria. Objetivo: Evaluar el impacto sobre la transmisión de malaria de un esquema de irrigación a pequeña escala en el área de Ziway, un área semi-árida del Gran Valle del Rift de Etiopía Central. Método: Se realizaron estudios parasitológicos, entomológicos y socio-económicos en un poblado con y un poblado sin irrigación. Durante las estaciones seca y lluviosa del 2005/2006 se tomaron muestras de sangre para láminas de los individuos del estudio. Mediante entrevistas y cuestionarios a los cabeza de familia e informantes clave agricultores y sanitarios, se recolectaron los datos socio-económicos. Se muestrearon mosquitos adultos y larvas durante las estaciones seca y lluviosa del 2006. Los mosquitos anofelinos hembra fueron testados mediante un ensayo ELISA para fuentes de comida e infecciones por esporozoitos. Resultados: La prevalencia de malaria era más alta en el poblado con irrigación (19.2%, P < 0.05) que en el no irrigado (16.0%). En el poblado con irrigación la prevalencia de malaria era más alta en la estación seca que en la lluviosa, mientras que lo contrario ocurría en el poblado no irrigado. Los hogares con acceso a irrigación tenían terrenos cultivables más grandes y mayores ingresos, pero también una mayor prevalencia de malaria. La abundancia de larvas y adultos de los vectores de malaria, An. arabiensis y An. pharoensis fue mayor en el poblado irrigado que en el no irrigado durante todo el periodo de estudio. Más aún, la abundancia de An. pharoensis era significativamente mayor que la de An. arabiensis durante el periodo seco e irrigado del año. Las piscinas de drenaje de los canales, los campos irrigados y los canales de irrigación fueron los principales hábitats de reproducción de los dos mosquitos vectores. Las tasas de infección de esporozoitos de P. falciparum de 1.18 y 0.66% se determinaron para An. arabiensis y An. pharoensis en el poblado irrigado. Los picos de actividad de mordedura de los vectores ocurría antes de las 22:00 horas, siendo una fuente de preocupación ya que la efectividad de las mosquiteras puede estar comprometida puesto que los mosquitos se alimentan de sangre antes de que las personas se vayan a la cama. Conclusión: Los esquemas de irrigación a lo largo del Valle de Rift Etiope podrían intensificar la malaria al aumentar los niveles de prevalencia durante la estación seca. Con el fin de reducir la intensidad de la transmisión de malaria en los esquemas de irrigación a pequeña escala en operación en Etiopía, se requiere incorporar a las estrategias de control de la malaria ya existentes, una reducción de las fuentes durante todo el año manejando adecuadamente la irrigación apropiada, junto con una educación sanitaria. Development of irrigation schemes is widely recognized as a key for promoting economic growth, ensuring food security and alleviating poverty in most developing countries (Lipton et al. 2003). However, past experience shows that inadequate consideration of public health aspects can seriously undermine the sustainability of such schemes (Hunter 1993; McCartney et al. 2007). Key among the potential negative impacts is the link between irrigation and malaria – a disease that affects between 300 and 500 million people each year globally and claims the lives of 1.5–2.5 million people annually (Keiser et al. 2005; WHO 2008). Especially in areas where malaria is unstable, irrigation may alter the malaria transmission pattern from seasonal to annual (Marramaa et al. 2004;Sissoko et al. 2004). However, the relationship between irrigation and malaria is not straightforward (Lindsay et al. 1991; Boudin et al. 1992; Henry et al. 2003). In some cases, the most anthropophilic malaria vector Anopheles funestus is replaced by Anopheles arabiensis that has lower vectorial capacity and thrives better in irrigated fields (Ijumba & Lindsay 2001). Higher mosquito densities in irrigated areas may lead to increased inter-species competition and reduced longevity (Dolo et al. 2004). Finally, communities near irrigation schemes may benefit from the greater wealth created by the schemes and get better access to improved health care and protective (Klinkenberg et al. 2004). In Ethiopia, where three-quarters of the land are potentially malarious, introduction or expansion of irrigation schemes can increase the burden of malaria in the country. In the highlands of Tigray, northern Ethiopia, malaria incidence in young children was sevenfold higher in communities near small dams than in those farther away (Ghebreyesus et al. 1999). However, despite extensive development of irrigation schemes in semi-arid fertile areas of the country with unstable disease transmission (Ministry of Water Resources 2002), detailed understanding of the link between irrigation and malaria in such settings is lacking. The main objective of this study was to analyse the impact of small-scale irrigation on malaria in a semi-arid area with seasonal disease transmission. The study was undertaken between September 2005 and May 2006 in two rural farming villages, Abene-Girmamo and Woshgulla, located in the Ziway area in the Ethiopian Rift Valley, Central Ethiopia, 165 km south of Addis Ababa. The area receives between 700 and 800 mm of annual rainfall, with the main rains from June to September and short rains in April and May (National Meteorological Agency, unpublished data). The mean annual temperature is 20 °C. Malaria transmission in Ziway is generally unstable and seasonal, with peak transmission between September and November, immediately after the main rainy season and a secondary transmission period between April and May in the short rainy season. Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent malaria parasite, responsible for 60–70% of malaria cases, followed by Plasmodium vivax (Abose et al. 1998b). Anopheles arabiensis is the primary malaria vector, while Anopheles pharoensis plays a secondary role (Rishikesh 1966; Abose et al. 1998a,b; Ye-ebiyo et al. 2000). Abene-Girmamo, the 'irrigated village', is situated at an altitude of 1647 m. The village was inhabited by 934 people in 2005, mainly dependent on irrigated subsistence farming during the dry season. Most families owned livestock (mainly bovine, ovine and equine), with a human to cattle ratio of 1:0.4. Irrigating farmers often stayed outdoors late, working on their field. In the rainy season, farmers practice rain-fed agriculture. Woshgulla, the 'non-irrigated village', is an agricultural village without irrigation, situated at an altitude of 1654 m, with a population size of 741 in 2005. The village is located 8 km away from the irrigation scheme in Abene-Girmamo. The inhabitants were dependent on subsistent rain-fed agriculture during the wet seasons and on livestock (mainly bovines and some equines) rearing. The mean human to cattle ratio in the village was 1:0.6. In both study villages, livestock spent the night either indoors in the same homesteads as the owners or outdoors in open cattle enclosures. Borrow pits for making mud bricks were commonly found at the backyards of houses. Each village had a water-harvesting pool (approximately 2 by 2 m wide and 6 m deep) covered with corrugated iron. Four different types of houses were distinguished in the area based on combinations of walls made of mud bricks or of wood plastered with mud, and roofs made of corrugated iron sheets or grass tops. The water source for irrigation in Abene-Girmamo is Lake Ziway, located 5–6 km away from the scheme. Water is pumped from the lake through three long underground pipes to the unlined elevated surface canals. These main irrigation canals feed furrows that cover the agricultural fields. Onion, cabbage, tomato and maize were the main irrigated crops throughout most of the year. Previous parasitological surveys conducted in the same study area found 3.5–12.6% prevalence during the main transmission period (July–December) (Abose et al. 1998a). Combined with time series recorded malaria data (1999–2005) from the Ziway Health Center, an average sample size was determined as 500 people per village by using Win Episcope 2.0 computer software (Wageningen University, Netherlands). Accordingly, 220 households (on average 4–5 people per household) were randomly selected for the parasitological surveys: 114 (51.8%) in the irrigated village and 106 (48.2%) in the non-irrigated village. In the study villages, finger prick blood samples were taken by experienced health technicians twice from a total of 2435 individuals, during the long rainy season (September/October 2005) and the dry season (January/February 2006). The slides with thick and thin blood smears were prepared, properly labelled, air dried and examined under a 100× oil immersion objective. Ethical clearance was provided by the Federal Ministry of Health under the umbrella arrangement for Addis Ababa University, and positive individuals were treated following national guidelines (MoH 2004). For the socio-economic study, a household was recorded as positive when at least one of the family members was found positive for malaria. A socio-economic survey was performed using a structured questionnaire in the same households selected for the parasitological study, after the household heads had signed a consent form. The questions elicited information on family size, composition of households (age and sex), farm size, average annual income per household, type of agricultural system (irrigation or rainfed), livestock ownership and housing condition (based on Klinkenberg et al. 2005). Anopheline larvae were sampled from the study villages for 8 days each in February and March in the dry season and in April and May in the short rainy season of 2006. At each survey, all available potential mosquito-breeding habitats were surveyed using a quantitative method (Amerasinghe & Munasingha 1988). Because of poor construction and lack of maintenance, most of the irrigation canals were leaking, creating permanent pools at undesirable places. Sometimes, poorly laid out furrows formed waterlogged areas in the field. The surface area of each potential mosquito-breeding site was estimated in square metres (m2), and sampling was performed at a rate of 6 dips/m2 (Amerasinghe et al. 2001). Larval anopheline samples were transferred to separate vials and killed by gently heating and preserved in 70% alcohol. Adult anophelines were sampled indoors and outdoors for 10 consecutive nights each between February and March in the dry season and between April and May in the short rainy season of 2006. A total of 12 (six indoors and six outdoors) Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps (Model 512; J. W. Hock Co., Atlanta, USA) was operated in each village from 1800 to 0700 h throughout each sampling night, collecting samples hourly on some days. Each indoor light trap was hung near a person sleeping under an untreated bed net (Yohannes et al. 2005). Outdoor light traps were hung on trees at close proximity to open cattle enclosures where some individuals spent the evening. Hourly mosquito collections were also conducted by light traps indoors and outdoors. Preserved anopheline larval samples were counted, and third and fourth larval instars individually mounted on microscope slides for species identification according to Verrone (1962b). All collected adult anophelines were sorted out into species (Verrone 1962a). Female anophelines were stored in a silica gel desiccator, transported to the Biomedical Science Laboratory at Addis Ababa University and kept there at room temperature (19–22 °C) for further processing. The head–thorax portion of each dried female anopheline was tested for the presence of P. falciparum and P. vivax sporozoite antigens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Wirtz et al. 1987). The direct ELISA procedure described by Beier et al. (1988) was used to determine the sources of blood meals (human vs. bovine) of the engorged female anophelines. Chi-square test was used to compare variations in malaria prevalence between villages and seasons. To identify household factors associated with malaria prevalence, logistic regression was applied. The abundance of larval and adult anophelines was compared between villages and seasons using non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test. The relative abundance of Anopheles species in the irrigated village was compared using Kruskal–Wallis Test. The sporozoite infection rate of each Anopheles species was expressed as the proportion of mosquitoes containing malaria sporozoite antigen in the total samples of a species tested by ELISA. The human blood index (HBI) for each Anopheles species was calculated as the proportion of samples positive for human blood in the total blood meals of a particular species tested. All analyses were carried out using Microsoft Excel 2003 and statistical software, spss version 13 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA). Table 1 shows the seasonal prevalence of malaria in the irrigated and non-irrigated study villages. Malaria prevalence was higher in the irrigated village (18.9%; P < 0.05) than in the non-irrigated village (16.1%) during the study period. However, there was seasonal variation in malaria prevalence between the two study villages. In the irrigated village, prevalence of P. falciparum infection was higher in the dry season (21%; P < 0.05) than in the wet season (9%) while prevalence of P. vivax infection became higher in the wet season (7.0%; P < 0.05) than the dry season (1.7%). In the non-irrigated village, prevalence of P. falciparum and P. vivax was higher in the wet season than in the dry season (Table 1). As age increased, malaria prevalence decreased in both villages. However, malaria prevalence was higher in all age groups during the dry season in the irrigated village than in the wet season and the reverse for the non-irrigated village (Table 2). Malaria prevalence was higher in households that use irrigation (mean malaria prevalence = 74.2; 95% CI = 69.9–78.5; P < 0.001) than in those using only rain fed in the irrigated (60.6%; 95% CI = 54.5–66.5) or non-irrigated (40.2; 95% CI = 36.7–43.7) villages (Figure 1). Among 114 households surveyed in the irrigated village, 97 (85.1%) were farmers and the rest (n = 17; 14.9%) were non-farmers (e.g. traders and government employees). Among 106 household surveyed in the non-irrigated village, 92 (86.8%) were farmers and the rest (n = 14; 13.2%) were government employees (5) or without a specific job (9). Among farming households in the irrigated village, 66 (68.0%) practiced rain-fed agriculture and 31 (32.0%) were both rain-fed user and irrigation user. Household malaria prevalence in 2006 by mode of agriculture in irrigated and non-irrigated villages in Ziway, Ethiopia (vertical bars show 95% confidence interval). In the non-irrigated village, bigger farm size (more than 1.5 hectares) was associated with a decrease in household malaria prevalence. In the irrigated areas, the household malaria prevalence hardly varied over three categories of farm size (Figure 2). On average, income per person per day of rain-fed producers and irrigation users was 0.15 and 0.56 US American dollar (USD), respectively. A change in house type from grass top to corrugated iron roof was associated with a decrease in malaria prevalence (Table 3). Surprisingly, an increase in the total annual income of households was positively associated with an increase in malaria infection prevalence. A history of malaria in the household malaria was also positively associated with malaria infection prevalence. Household malaria infection prevalence in different farm size categories in irrigated and non-irrigated areas in Ziway, Ethiopia. (vertical bars show 95% confidence intervals) (1 kert is 0.25 hectar). Four-times more positive Anopheles larval sites were encountered in the irrigated village (n = 51) compared to the non-irrigated village (n = 12) during the study period (Table 4). Consequently, a higher Anopheles larval density was found in the irrigated village (36.0 larvae per 100 dips; z = −3.196, P < 0.001) than in the non-irrigated village (14.9 per 100 dips) throughout the study period. In the irrigated village, Anopheles breeding occurred both in the dry and in the wet seasons while larval occurrence was limited to the wet season in the non-irrigated village (Table 4). Five species anopheline larvae were collected, among which An. arabiensis, An. pharoensis and Anopheles coustani were the major ones (Table 5). In the irrigated village, canal leakage pools and irrigated field puddles were the most important sources of An. arabiensis, whereas canal leakage pools and irrigation canals were the major larval habitats for An. pharoensis. Overall, around 80% of the total Anopheles larval occurrence in the irrigated village was from habitats associated with the irrigation scheme. In the non-irrigated village, borrow pits and rain pools were the only larval habitats (Table 5). A total of 1271 adult anophelines were collected from the two study villages during the study period, of which 94% (n = 1213) and 6% (n = 58) were from the irrigated and non-irrigated villages, respectively (Table 6). In the irrigated village, An. pharoensis was the major species in the dry season (56.9%; n = 340; χ2 = 52.294; df = 2; P < 0.001) while An. arabiensis dominated in the short rainy season (50.2%; n = 309; χ2 = 17.751, df = 2, P < 0.001). The majority (65.5%, n = 38) of anophelines in the non-irrigated village were An. arabiensis. No adult mosquitoes were caught in the non-irrigated village during the dry season. Peak indoor and outdoor activities of An. arabiensis were observed during the early period of the night, between 18:00–19:00 and 19:00–20:00 h, respectively (Figure 3). Thereafter, its activity steadily decreased both indoors and outdoors throughout the rest of the night. Peak indoor and outdoor activities of An. pharoensis occurred between 20:00–21:00 and 19:00–20:00 h, respectively, which declined thereafter, but with a remarkable second peak between 22:00–23:00 h outdoors. For An. coustani, peak indoor and outdoor activities were recorded between 18:00–19:00 h, which sharply dropped thereafter but with a remarkable secondary peak between 22:00–23:00 and 05:00–06:00 h, indoors and outdoors, respectively. Overall, about 75%, 66% and 69% of the bite by An. arabiensis, An. pharoensis and An. coustani, respectively, occurred during the early period of the night (before 22:00 h), before the villagers retire to bed (Figure 2). Hourly activity of Anopheles arabiensis (top), Anopheles pharoensis (middle) and Anopheles coustani (bottom) indoors and outdoors from light trap catches (as percentage of mosquitoes collected each hour; n = 24 light trap nights in all cases) in an irrigated area in Ziway, February to May 2006. Among 120 blood-fed An. arabiensis specimens, 70.8% (n = 85) and 14.2% (n = 17) were found positive for only human and bovine blood, respectively. Some (7.5%, n = 9) had mixed blood meals of human and cattle, and the remaining were unidentified (7.5%, n = 9). The HBI for An. arabiensis was found to be 0.78. Of 142 blood-engorged female An. pharoensis specimens, 61.3% (n = 87) and 20.4% (n = 29) had human and bovine blood meals, respectively. Some blood meals (7.7%, n = 11) were mixed, and the remaining blood meals were not identified. The HBI for An. pharoensis was 0.69. Of 16 blood-engorged An. coustani specimens, only one (6.2%; HBI 6%) was positive for human blood while the majority (75%, n = 12) gave positive results for bovine blood. In the irrigated village, among 424 female An. arabiensis and 509 An. pharoensis specimens tested for P. falciparum sporozoites, five (1.18%) and three (0.59%) were positive, respectively. Seasonally, higher P. falciparum sporozoite rate of An. arabiensis was recorded in the short rainy season (1.47%; 4/272) than in the dry season (0.66%; 1/152). The P. falciparum sporozoite rate of An. pharoensis was 0.92% (3/325) in dry season, while none (0/184) were positive in the short rainy season. None of the tested samples from the irrigated village were positive for P. vivax sporozoite, and none of the samples collected from the non-irrigated villages were positive for malaria sporozoites. Our study found higher larval and adult vector abundance and a higher prevalence of malaria in the irrigated village than the non-irrigated village particularly during the dry season – implying the continuation of malaria transmission in this season where transmission is normally unexpected. The major finding of the present study is that because of breeding of malaria vectors (An. arabiensis and An. pharoensis) in the small-scale irrigation scheme in Ziway, the period of malaria transmission in the irrigated village has extended into the dry season. Higher malaria prevalence in the dry season, as observed in households that use irrigation, could be because irrigation activities continue in the evening when the major malaria vectors' peak biting activities occur. Thus, irrigating farmers would be at higher risk of infective mosquito bites during the dry season. Lower prevalence in the wet season in the irrigated village could be explained by density-dependent mechanisms, such as competition, which might affect the proportion of sporozoite-infected mosquitoes, even resulting in reduced transmission at higher densities (Dolo et al. 2004). Among household factors evaluated in the socio-economic survey, quality of housing was an important health determinant. A decreasing trend in malaria prevalence was observed when the housing quality improved from grass top to corrugated iron roof. This finding is in agreement with previous studies elsewhere (Konradsen et al. 2003; Deressa et al. 2007). Household malaria prevalence was also positively associated with previous malaria infection history, which could be because of the clustering of mosquitoes to specific houses close to mosquito-breeding sites within a village (Ribeiro et al. 1996; Brooker et al. 2004). The entomological survey indicated the most important prolific Anopheles larval habitats to be poorly constructed irrigation canals (with stagnant water), canal leakage pools and puddles in waterlogged fields, especially during the dry season. The same breeding habitats have been productive breeding grounds for An. arabiensis elsewhere (Ijumba et al. 1990; Yohannes et al. 2005; Muturi et al. 2006). In the non-irrigated village, only larvae and no adult mosquitoes were found during the dry season, possibly because CDC traps are not sensitive enough for sampling low-density populations (Line et al. 1990). We found peak indoor and outdoor activities of An. arabiensis, An. pharoensis and An. coustani during the early period of the night (before 22:00 h), coinciding with the evening activities of the people in the study area. Similar early biting behaviour was previously reported elsewhere in Ethiopia (Abose et al. 1998b; Taye et al. 2006). The early biting activity of An. arabiensis could be a consequence of long-term application of residual insecticides, particularly DDT, as it has also been suggested for northern Ethiopia (Yohannes et al. 2005). Such early biting activities of the malaria vector populations are likely to compromise the efficacy of insecticide-treated bed nets as most bites occurred before the villagers go to sleep. This could partly explain why higher income households with larger farm size in the irrigated village did not show lower malaria prevalence because even if they would invest in protective measures such as bednets, these are of little advantage. The reported high HBI for An. arabiensis (0.78) and An. pharoensis (0.69) in the present study reaffirmed the importance of these species in malaria transmission in Ziway area. Comparable HBI has been reported in other parts of the country (Adugna & Petros 1996; Yohannes et al. 2005) suggesting their antropophagic behaviour. The P. falciparum sporozoite rate of An. arabiensis in the present study (1.18%) is comparable to that reported from southern Ethiopia (1.1%, Habtewold et al. 2001; Taye et al. 2006; Tirados et al. 2006), but lower than the sporozoite rate in the adjacent Wonji area (1.5%, Ameneshewa 1995). In our study, the P. falciparum sporozoite rate of An. pharoensis in the dry season confirms the vectorial role of this species in malaria transmission in the irrigated villages of Ziway area. Anopheles arabiensis was infected with P. falciparum sporozoites both in the dry and in the short rainy seasons, suggesting that this species plays a significant role in malaria transmission throughout the year. These findings could be the first report of confirmed P. falciparum infection in vector mosquitoes in the dry season and also for An. pharoensis that could play an important role in transmitting P. falciparum. In conclusion, although development of irrigation schemes is of paramount importance to increase crop yield and enhance food security in Ethiopia, our findings underscore the importance of irrigation schemes in semi-arid areas like Ziway in maintaining malaria transmission particularly during the dry season, when mosquito abundance is normally limited. The findings also suggest a need for health education so that irrigators would invest in personal protection measures (e.g. protective clothing and repellents in the evening), rather than to rely on bednets that are no longer very effective with mosquitoes biting earlier. Proper water management and canal maintenance for source reduction through environmental management could help to reduce mosquito-breeding sites and thus malaria transmission.

N2  - Objectives: The study was premised on the notion that insecticide-treated mosquito nets are positively related to malaria prevalence, and that knowledge mediates the relationship between insecticide-treated mosquito nets and malaria. Furthermore, household income was hypothesized to have a moderating effect on the direct and indirect relationships (through malaria knowledge) between insecticide-treated mosquito nets and the prevalence of malaria. Methods: The hypothesized relationships were examined using panel data collected from ten regions of Ethiopia during 2011-2015. Structural equation modeling and the random effect model were used to test the hypotheses. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata version 13.0. Results: The results were consistent with our proposed hypotheses, showing a significant relationship between the research variables. The findings suggest that malaria knowledge contributes to improving the relationship between insecticide-treated mosquito nets and malaria prevalence. A positively significant indirect effect (β = 0.47, p = 0.003) as well as direct effect (β = 0.28, p = 0.001) was revealed in the study. Furthermore, a positive impact of household income in strengthening the relationship between insecticide-treated mosquito nets and malaria through knowledge was reported, with a considerable value (β = 0.13, p = 0.000). The result also reveals differences in the outcome of malaria prevalence at different levels of household income category, where the indirect effect of insecticide-treated mosquito nets on malaria prevalence via malaria knowledge was positive and significant for households under the second-level income category (β = 0.15, p = 0.000). Conversely, the indirect effect of insecticide-treated mosquito nets on malaria prevalence via malaria knowledge was negative for the high level-income category (β = -0.14, p = 0.022). Besides, insignificant and negative relationships were reported for households under low-level income categories (β = 0.024, p = 0.539). Conclusion: The findings are potentially useful for the health sector to ensure success in infectious disease prevention and control, particularly malaria, and to explain how various factors contribute to the relationship.

N2  - Abstract Background Sub-Saharan Africa has seen substantial reductions in cases and deaths due to malaria over the past two decades. While this reduction is primarily due to an increasing expansion of interventions, urbanisation has played its part as urban areas typically experience substantially less malaria transmission than rural areas. However, this may be partially lost with the invasion and establishment of Anopheles stephensi. An. stephensi , the primary urban malaria vector in Asia, was first detected in Africa during 2012 in Djibouti and was subsequently identified in Ethiopia in 2016, and later in Sudan and Somalia. In Djibouti, malaria cases have increased 30-fold from 2012 to 2019 though the impact in the wider region remains unclear. Methods Here we have adapted an existing model of mechanistic malaria transmission to estimate the increase in vector density required to explain the trends in malaria cases seen in Djibouti. To account for the observed plasticity in An. stephensi behaviour, and the unknowns of how it will establish in a novel environment, we sample behavioural parameters in order to account for a wide range of uncertainty. This quantification is then applied to Ethiopia, considering temperature-dependent extrinsic incubation periods, pre-existing vector-control interventions and Plasmodium falciparum prevalence in order to assess the potential impact of An. stephensi establishment on P. falciparum transmission. Following this, we estimate the potential impact of scaling up ITN (insecticide treated nets)/IRS (indoor residual spraying) and implementing piperonyl butoxide (PBO) ITNs and larval source management,, as well as their economic costs. Results We estimate that annual P. falciparum malaria cases could increase by 50% (95% CI 14-90) if no additional interventions are implemented. The implementation of sufficient control measures to reduce malaria transmission to pre- stephensi levels will cost hundreds of millions of USD. Conclusions Substantial heterogeneity across the country is predicted and large increases in vector control interventions could be needed to prevent a major public health emergency.

N2  - Malaria is still a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in many developing countries including Ethiopia. Its prevalence has been declining among Ethiopian adults, especially in Dembia district. However, it is still at the top of diseases list at the district. Hence, the study aimed to determine the prevalence and the factors that contribute to its being the major public health concern despite different preventive and control measures in place.A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from October 11 to November 16, 2017. The multistage sampling technique was employed to select 832 study participants. A rapid diagnostic test were used to confirm the disease. Data were entered using Epi info version 7 and was analyzed by Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. The logistic regression model was performed to examine the association of factors with malaria parasite.Out of the 832 adults included in the study, 6.7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI: 5.2-8.7)) were confirmed to be malaria parasite carriers. The dominant plasmodium species was Plasmodium falciparum [46 (82%)]. According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis, male sex (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR = 4.5; 95%CI: 2.1-9.5), adult age 15-19 years (AOR = 4.5; 95%CI: 2.1-9.7), travel history (AOR = 5; 95%CI: 2.34-12.25), and stagnant water around home (AOR = 3.7; 95%CI: 1.57-8.87) increased the probability of malaria infectivity, while Insecticidal Treated Nets (ITN) utilization (AOR = 0.2; 95%CI: 0.09-0.31) decreased it.Malaria is still an important public health challenge among adults in the study area. Male sex, age 15-19 years, travel history, living around stagnant water, and not using ITN increased the probability of infection. Therefore, the District Health office and Health extension workers should work to increase ITN distribution and focus on reducing malaria breading sites through community participation.

N2  - In spite of the importance of agriculture in Ethiopia, it is characterized by low productivity and has been unable to produce sufficient quantities of output to feed the country’s population. In light of this various development strategies has been undertaken to improve the performance of agriculture. Intensification of agriculture through the use of new agricultural technologies has been emphasized over the last three decades. This study attempted to examine the contribution of agricultural input for crop productivity. The data for the study was collected from 91 sample farmers. This study was the study used both primary and secondary data. In this study researcher was used simple random sampling techniques. This research was use cross sectional approach and econometric method of data analysis to investigate the role of age, sex, land size, labor force, fertilizer, improved seed, extension service, and access to credit, education level and pesticides for crop production by collecting data from the household. In econometric method of data analysis researcher was used ordinary least square (OLS) Model. The econometric result show that land size, labor force, improved seed, fertilizer, credit service, extension service and education level have positive and significant effect on crop production. However, pesticide has a negative and significant impact on crop production. From the explanatory variables, education level has a higher coefficient. This indicates education level is more significant for crop production. According regression result &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;R&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/sup&amp;gt; is 0.97, which implies 97% of output function is explained by the selected ten (10) explanatory variables. The policy implication is that to reduce farmers resistant to use farm inputs and to create knowledge about the optimal input use educate and training of farmers is necessary.

N2  - For urban agriculture to make a significant contribution to development, particularly in a city like Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where chronic poverty persists, it must present feasible, sustainable business opportunities in addition to its established social benefits. Ultimately, this research intends to investigate how vegetable production has helped supplement the food and income of dwellers in the urban areas of the Addis Ababa metropolitan area. Both qualitative and quantitative data were used. Household quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results disclosed, people in Addis Ababa use vegetable production as a source of food stability to ensure self-sustainability. Further, the creation of job opportunities in vegetable cultivation in the city allows the unemployed and even employed groups to participate. There is no academic criterion required, which makes it easier for people with low or no education to engage in vegetable production. According to 99.2% of respondents, vegetable production activities provide fresh food for their households. Per production, 41.9% of respondents earned up to 10,000 birr. For farm activities, 30.7% of vegetable producers hire up to ten employees, while seeds and pesticides are more expensive inputs than other necessary items. The multivariate analysis showed that households that earn around 10,000 birr per production were significantly affected by farming in residential areas (p = 0.008). Surveys conducted reveal that households are more concerned about food consumption than using their products to profit.

N2  - The acyl urea insecticide teflubenzuron (=Nomolt -) caused loss of appetite, ecdysial failure and eventual death in 4th instar Schistocerca gregaria. The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae also caused mortality due to mycosis among nymphs of the locust. Enhanced mortality occurred following dual application of the growth regulator and the fungus, which at one combination was synergistic. In another experiment, the fungus was exposed to cuticle treated with acetone (the carrier for the insecticide). This reduced the effectiveness of the fungus. An ultrastructural study showed the effect of the joint application of another acyl urea diflubenzuron (= Dimlin-) and Metarhizium anisopliae on locust cuticle. Disruption of the lamellae pattern was observed in some areas of cuticle. This is consistent with localised disruption of chitin synthesized during treatment with Dimlin. This compound, that has a short half-life in the locust, was applied to the food at 5 day interval over a 15 day period. Clearing zones in the cuticle around penetrant hyphae suggested action of cuticle degrading fungal enzymes. These zones were more extensive around gyphae in Dimlin-affected cuticle suggesting possible enhanced hydrolysis of cuticle protein by fungal proteases in the absence of chitin.

N2  - This study endeavoured to measure the technical efficiency of large-scale agricultural investment in Northwest Ethiopia. Besides, it strives to fathom the socioeconomic attributes and farm management techniques that influence technical inefficiency. This study uses the stochastic frontier approach to estimate the technical efficiency based on the cross-section data of 200 investors selected through a multiple-stage random sampling technique. The study established that better utilization of capital, labour, land, and seed inputs was reflected positively (albeit proportionally less) in grain output; however, the influence of agrochemical inputs was negative. The study highlighted the positive role of gender and level of education in improving technical efficiency, whereas on the other hand, age, occupation, district, and subsidies contributed to technical inefficiency. The study found that the overall mean technical efficiency for the study area was 71.7%, meaning that producers produce grain at a loss of around 28.3% due to technical inefficiency. As a result, it might be said that producers use their technology and resources somewhat inefficiently. The outcome of the study calls for more education for adults, and female producers should be encouraged and given the opportunity to manage the large-scale grain farming segment. In addition, the government is compelled to provide strategies about proper input appliances and set up a pilot research institution in the study area.

The results are similar for bed nets treated with insecticide. Cropper, Haile, Lampietti, Poulos, and Whittington measure the monetary value households place on preventing malaria in Tembien, Tigray Region, Ethiopia. They estimate a household demand function for a hypothetical malaria vaccine and compute the value of preventing malaria as the household's maximum willingness to pay to provide vaccines for all family members. They contrast willingness to pay with the traditional costs of illness (medical costs and time lost because of malaria). Their results indicate that the value of preventing malaria with vaccines is about US$36 a household a year, or about 15 percent of imputed annual household income. This is, on average, about two or three times the expected household cost of illness. Despite the great benefits from preventing malaria, the fact that vaccine demand is price inelastic suggests that it will be difficult to achieve significant market penetration unless the vaccine is subsidized. The authors obtain similar results for insecticide-treated bed nets. Their estimates of household demand functions for bed nets suggest that at a price that might permit cost recovery (US$6 a bed net), only a third of the population of a 200-person village would sleep under bed nets.

N2  - For the past twenty years, many scientific papers on malaria have begun with statements such as 'there are an estimated three billion people at risk of the disease'; or '300–600 million episodes of clinical falciparum malaria occur each year, killing between one and three million individuals annually'; or 'the global burden of malaria exceeds 40 million disability-adjusted life years' [1,2]. These figures may once have been a credible approximation, but need to be looked at today with considerable scepticism, even when they appear in official statements. Indeed, figures of malaria incidence/prevalence or of disease burden, are mostly based on reports of 'presumptive diagnosis', the accuracy of which is 50% at best and less than 5% in situations of low endemicity. Figures relating to malaria mortality are even less reliable, because the exact cause of death is always difficult to determine, even in hospital settings [3]. Recent studies of severe malaria in children in Malawi and in Kenya suggest that, in at least 25% of cases, the WHO definition of severe malaria is unable to exclude concomitant bacterial or viral infections, which may actually be responsible for the fatal outcome [4]. The field reality is worse, when one considers that many malaria cases occur in remote areas, where the resources for making adequate diagnosis are not available.  However, a general pattern is emerging, based on recent publications and public statements and despite this inadequacy of the baseline figures, that malaria incidence is decreasing worldwide and, in some cases, this has actually been documented by reliable data. For example, child mortality on the Kenyan coast has been reduced [5], and, over the past few years, there has been a fall of 50–75% in malaria incidence in Zanzibar [6], Eritrea [7], Ethiopia and Rwanda [8]. Interestingly, there have been reports from travel clinics in Europe indicating a reduction in their imported malaria cases [9,10]. Policy-makers are keen to believe that this reduction of malaria cases and of malaria mortality is the result of their activity and the mass interventions that have been made possible through unprecedented funding for malaria control. An estimated US$1.5 billion was spent in 2007, 47% of which was disbursed by international donor agencies, including the Global Fund [11]. Existing control measures, including large-scale distribution of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, improved diagnosis using rapid tests, treatment using a combination of effective drugs including artemisinin, and prevention/treatment of high-risk target groups such as pregnant women, are known to work and will undoubtedly have had an impact when implemented on an operational scale in some endemic areas. However, a decrease of malaria incidence has not always followed implementation of control measures and other factors, both human and climatic, may have also played a part. Nevertheless, the decreasing pattern of incidence is encouraging and, by giving funding agencies a first impression of success, it has helped enormously in the advocacy for further increases in the global funding effort, which are considered necessary to achieve malaria control. As a result, Bill and Melinda Gates surprised the malaria community in October 2007 by expressing their firm commitment to global 'malaria eradication' [12]. This was a bold statement, since the word 'eradication' had not been used in official statements since the early 1970s, when the failure of an earlier global eradication attempt was recognized. The statement has had three noticeable effects: (i) almost immediately, other agencies, hitherto committed to control, jumped on the eradication band wagon, (ii) it put the goal of 'elimination', if not yet of 'eradication', on the global agenda with a notional target date of 2025, and (iii) the notion of elimination by 2025 captured the imagination of the scientific community working on malaria, which moved in a short space of time from a realistic awareness of the enormity of the complex and seemingly insoluble problem of malaria control to cautious optimism that elimination by 2025 is a real possibility – the Emperor's New Clothes, perhaps?  Nobody believes that elimination will be easy to achieve and it will undoubtedly require sustained, high level funding and political commitment for many years. Indeed, history shows that the single most important cause of failure of the 1960s eradication campaign was the rapid loss of political commitment once control had been shown to work. The move from control to elimination is actually a quantum leap. If it were once possible to state that all the tools for control were available and that no further research was required, it is doubtful whether elimination could be achieved with those same tools. There is now a need to define a new research agenda and to identify the differences between control and elimination.  Malaria Journal is now in its seventh year of existence and it has become a major journal in the discipline, reporting on all aspects of malaria, 'from the bench, to the bedside and to the bush'. There will no doubt be many papers published on malaria elimination in the future, but it is fitting that Malaria Journal should be the first journal to publish a series of review articles looking at the many aspects of the research agenda for malaria elimination on a global scale.

N2  - Background. Malaria is one of the deadliest mosquito-borne diseases in sub-Saharan Africa and Ethiopia. Owing to their costs and environmental issues, synthetic insecticides are poor choices to control mosquitoes. Plant-based products can be considered as safe and biodegradable alternatives. The present study aimed to test the toxicity and oviposition deterrent activities of Thymus serrulatus and Thymus schimperi essential oils (EOs) against Anopheles arabiensis. Methods. Thyme EOs were extracted by hydrodistillation using the Clevenger-type apparatus. They were named Tar, Ala, and Yil after the areas of thyme collection Tarmaber, Alamata, and Yilmana Densa, respectively. Laboratory-based tests were used to determine the larvicidal, adulticidal, oviposition deterrent, and half lethal dose (LD50) of each EO. Results. The concentrations of 100 μl/L and 50 μl/L resulted in complete mortalities of larvae and adults, respectively, for all the three Eos considered. The EOs exhibited high repellency with oviposition activity index of −1 (OAI = −1) at concentrations of 50 μl/L (Tar), 100 μl/L (Ala), and 200 μl/L (Yil). Conclusions. The EOs of T. serrulatus and T. schimperi were effective against larvae and adult mosquitoes at small doses and resulted in oviposition deterrence at doses from 50 to 200 μl/L. Thus, these EOs are promising mosquitocides and oviposition deterrents. But, further tests both in the presence of already known and effective deterrents and field trials are required.

N2  - Ethiopia has achieved impressive agricultural growth over the past two decades and is seen as one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa. Most of the impressive growth was registered in the crop sub-sector. This study employed agricultural sample national-level survey data from 2004/05 to 2019/20 period corresponding to successive five-year development plan periods. Descriptive analysis using the crop cut data used to show crop productivity growth for crop categories. Growth accounting analysis was applied by computing Total Factor Productivity (TFP) change with four scenarios -using primary and intermediate longitudinal input data. Results showed total crop output grew by 2.6-fold with an average rate of 9.0% per annum. Crop output increases were mainly driven by strong yield growth and increases in labour use, chemical fertilizer, TFP, and area under improved seed. Together these factors accounted for 74% of the growth in total real crop output and 21% for cultivated land, rural roads, and return to scale (RTS) together. The key drivers were labour (26%), chemical fertilizer and TFP each accounting for 17%, improved seed (14%) and expansion in cultivated land (9%). Estimates of average annual TFP growth for the period 2004/05-2009/10 depicted the highest annual average growth (0.54-6.64%) but declined during GTP-I (0.58 to 5.3%) and more in GTP-II (-0.1%-3.4%). The results reflect a need for a strong investment push for expanding the use of inputs such as improved seed, fertilizer, pesticide and irrigation through intensive extension to curb the recent crop productivity decline.

N2  - Abstract Trypanosomiasis is an impediment to cattle production and other agricultural development in tsetse-infested areas. It is a severe parasitic disease that causes loss in the production and performance of cattle. Hence, the aim of this paper is to review trypanosomiasis control options with emphasis on the use of trypanotolerant Sheko cattle breed for sustainable management of bovine trypanosomiasis in tsetse infested areas. Several methods have been used to control trypanosomiasis through the use of trypanocidal drugs and the management of the vector, tsetse fly. Tsetse fly controls require expensive insecticides and have adverse environmental consequences. Trypanocidal drugs are commonly used and considered a practical trypanosomiasis control method. However, the rise in trypanocidal drug resistance has rendered this option ineffective. The possibility of developing and using a vaccine against trypanosomiasis currently remains out of reach as Trypanosoma periodically undergo antigenic variation. In the absence of a vaccine, presence of trypanocidal drug resistance, and the lack of sustainable tsetse fly control measures demand the need to use trypanotole-rant cattle breeds. The Sheko breed which is found only in southwestern Ethiopia displays considerable natural resistance to tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis. This genetic resource provides sustainable solution for challenges related to trypanosomiasis. These cattle have a low level of parasitemia and are able to maintain a good packed cell volume (PCV) compared to other indigenous breeds. As several trypanosomiasis control methods are ineffective, the use of trypanotolerance cattle like Sheko breed in tsetse-fly-challenged areas was suggested.

N2  - Late blight (<i>Phytophthora infenstans</i>) disease is one of the most devastating potato diseases world-widely which causes significant loss in production. It is known to hurt the highest losses from disease attacks. Among potato diseases bacterial wilt and late blight are one of the most economically important. In Ethiopia yield loss study on potato late blight was very old and scanty. This study was designed to update yield loss data for potato late blight disease. In this study, 3 treatments were used with a completely randomized block design (RCBD) with 3 replications including the control. The results of AUDPC and tuber yield shows significant differences (P<0.05) among treatments. Compared to the unsprayed plot fungicides significantly controlled the disease at both early and late stages. The lowest (175.0) AUDPC was recorded on fungicide Gachena 525 WG sprayed treatment followed by Mancozeb 80% WP (190.0). The control treatment (water sprayed) had the highest AUDPC (1450.0). The highest (29.3 t/ha) mean tuber yield was obtained from the fungicide Gachena 525 WG followed by the standard fungicide (Mancozeb 80% WP) which gave (27.2 t/ha) whereas the control treatment gave 4.9 t/ha. The fungicide subjected to the test (Gachena 525 WG) deserves to be considered as an alternate fungicide to the widely used fungicide Mancozeb 80% WP in the country. The highest (83.28%) yield loss occurred in the unsprayed plots of the Jalene variety as compared to the best-protected plots sprayed with Gachena 525 WG fungicide. Generally, disease and yield parameters indicate that among the fungicides spray; Gachena 525 WG was the most effective followed by Mancozeb 80% WP sprayed plots as compared to the unsprayed plots.

Yet following several years of high food prices, concerted policy efforts to intensify fertilizer and hybrid seed use, and increased public and private investment in agriculture, how low is modern input use in Africa really? This paper revisits Africa's agricultural input landscape, exploiting the unique, recently collected, nationally representative, agriculturally intensive, and cross-country comparable Living Standard Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture covering six countries in the region (Ethiopia, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda). The study uses data from more than 22,000 households and 62,000 plots to investigate a range of commonly held conceptions about modern input use in Africa, distilling the most striking and important findings into 10 key takeaway descriptive results.

N2  - <title>Abstract</title> Objective The objective of the research was to identify key factors influencing smallholder farmers' why not follow the recommended pesticide safety practices in northwestern Ethiopia. The study conducted in 2020/2021 investigated factors influencing smallholder farmers' adherence to recommended pesticide safety practices in northwestern Ethiopia. The survey involving 50 farmers in Fogera and 53 in Mecha assessed pesticide use practices and perceptions, aiming to reveal common challenges in pesticide management. Survey data highlighted significant pesticide application and barriers related to adopting personal protective equipment (PPE), proper pesticide storage, integrated pest management (IPM), and safe disposal of containers. Result Statistical analyses indicated non-significant differences between districts regarding these practices, underscoring universal issues such as economic constraints, limited resource access, and inadequate awareness. Crops like maize, faba bean, and cabbage showed high pesticide usage rates in both districts without statistically significant differences, emphasizing their cumulative impact on food safety. This finding underscores the urgent need for comprehensive interventions. Measures such as subsidized PPE, infrastructure development for safe pesticide storage, enhanced educational campaigns, and strengthened regulatory frameworks are crucial to promote sustainable agricultural practices and mitigate health and environmental risks. In conclusion, the study identifies widespread barriers to effective pesticide management among smallholder farmers in Fogera and Mecha, including economic limitations and resource constraints. Addressing these challenges necessitates a multifaceted strategy that includes subsidized PPE, improved storage infrastructure, and intensified educational initiatives to foster sustainable practices and safeguard both human health and the environment.

N2  - Abstract Background- Malaria is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality particularly in sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Approximately, 68% of its population is at a risk of malaria infection and nearly three-fourth of the Ethiopia landmass is considered as malarious. Most of the malaria related researches are being conducted in the rural areas; however, urban malaria should be also targeted without which malaria elimination is impossible. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of malaria and its associated risk factors in Batu town, Oromia Regional state, Ethiopia. Methods – Finger pricked blood samples were collected from 356 febrile individuals visiting health facilities in Batu town from April to July, 2018 supplemented with questionnaire survey to assess socio-demographic and risk factors associated with malaria infection. Results – In the current study an overall prevalence of 17.13% (61/356) malaria infection was observed of which 50.8% (31/61) were positive for P. vivax , 45.95% (28/61) were positive for P. falciparum and 3.3% (2/61) were mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax . Males (32 (9%)) were more infected with malaria than females (29 (8.2%)). Sex had no statistical significance association with malaria (χ2 = 2.026, P = 0.155). Logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals who possessed ITN (OR = 0.38, 95% CI (0.194, 0.743) and P = 0.005) and whose houses were sprayed with insecticides (OR = 0.18, 95% CI (0.097, 0.34) and P &lt;0.001) were found less likely to get malaria infection. Individuals living closer to stagnant water had more chance of malaria infection than those who were found at a distant from stagnant water (OR = 0.34, 95% CI (0.19, 0.59) and P&lt;0.001). Conclusion- The current study revealed that malaria is still public health problem in Batu town, which might indicate the same in other urban areas of the country. Therefore, in order to get the national picture about the prevalence of urban malaria and its associated risk factors, we recommend large scale investigation of the situation.

N2  - This study examined the use of crop health advices that farmers received at village-based plant clinics and their determinants in Ethiopia. Data were collected from 210 randomly selected plant clinic users from three districts of Ethiopia, and analysed using descriptive statistics and a binary logistic regression model. Plant clinic users were smallholders with an average landholding of 0.8 ha, predominantly male, with a mean age of 46 years. Most recommendations for pest management were a combination of monitoring, cultural practices and pesticides, in line with Integrated Pest Management (IPM) principles. About 64% and 34% of the clinic users fully or partially, respectively, applied the recommendations. After visiting plant clinics, farmers demonstrated improved knowledge and practices in using pesticides, although no significant difference was observed between the types of pesticides they used. Stability of plant doctors, distance to plant clinics, and education significantly and positively influenced the use of plant clinic advice, whereas age was negatively associated. The findings suggest that plant clinics provide relevant and practical advice that address plant health problems of farmers. Thus, such project-based intervention should be fully integrated into regular programmes to ensure their sustainability.

N2  - In Ethiopia, malaria infections and other complications during pregnancy contribute to the high burden of maternal morbidity and mortality. Preventive measures are available, however little is known about the factors influencing the uptake of maternal health services and interventions by pregnant women in Ethiopia.We analyzed data from a community-based cross-sectional survey conducted in 2016 in three rural districts of Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, with 3784 women who had a pregnancy outcome in the year preceding the survey. We used multivariable logistic regression models accounting for clustering to identify the determinants of antenatal care (ANC) attendance and insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership and use, and the prevalence and predictors of malaria infection among pregnant women.Eighty-four percent of interviewed women reported receiving at least one ANC visit during their last pregnancy, while 47% reported attending four or more ANC visits. Common reasons for not attending ANC included women's lack of awareness of its importance (48%), distance to health facility (23%) and unavailability of transportation (14%). Important determinants of ANC attendance included higher education level and wealth status, woman's ability to make healthcare decisions, and pregnancy intendedness. An estimated 48% of women reported owning an ITN during their last pregnancy. Of these, 55% reported to have always slept under it during their last pregnancy. Analysis revealed that the odds of owning and using ITNs were respectively 2.07 (95% CI: 1.62-2.63) and 1.73 (95% CI: 1.32-2.27) times higher among women who attended at least one ANC visit. The self-reported prevalence of malaria infection during pregnancy was low (1.4%) across the three districts. We found that young, uneducated, and unemployed women presented higher odds of malaria infection during their last pregnancy.ANC and ITN uptake during pregnancy in Jimma Zone fall below the respective targets of 95 and 90% set in the Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan for 2020, suggesting that more intensive programmatic efforts still need to be directed towards improving access to these health services. Reaching ANC non-users and ITN ownership and use as part of ANC services could be emphasized to address these gaps.

N2  - Onion (Allium cepa) is popularly called as “Queen of Kitchen” as it is used as food, salad, spice, condiment and in medicine. Currently, the production is practiced all over the round for its daily uses in food and source of income and for commercial purposes starting from the introduction in the country as planting material from Sudan. However, its productivity is constrained by both biotic and abiotic factors of production. Thrips, thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) is the most limiting factor and causes significant yield loses among biotic factors. In this study, the efficacy of the new insecticide (Diesel (Lufenuron+Emamectin benzoate) was tested with standard check (CORSA (Profenofos 40% + Cypermethrin 4%EC) and unsprayed check included for comparison in three location (Sinana on station, Goba and Aloshe) using a plot size of 10m by 10m for each treatment. Accordingly, the result found that, the new insecticide was effective as of the standard check in controlling the infestation of thrips and reducing the yield losses which contributes in increasing both production and productivity of onion. Therefore, Diesel (Lufenuron+Emamectin benzoate) insecticide can be registered and used as management option for control of onion thrips in Ethiopia.

N2  - Abstract Background Despite consecutive decades of success in reducing malaria transmission, Ethiopia went off track towards its goal of malaria elimination by 2030, as outlined in the NMCP malaria strategy. Recent malaria outbreaks in Ethiopia are attributed to the emergence and spread of diagnostic and drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum , increased insecticide resistance in major vectors and the spread of invasive Anopheles stephensi . The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, environmental anomalies and internal conflicts have also potentially played a role in increasing malaria transmission. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of environmental factors and An. stephensi to the spatiotemporal trends of recent malaria cases in Ethiopia. Methods Clinical malaria case data reported weekly between January 2013 and January 2023 were obtained from the Ethiopian Public Health Institute (EPHI), Addis Ababa. A negative binomial regression model was used to explain the variability and potential overdispersion in the weekly number of malaria cases reported across Ethiopian administrative zones. This model incorporated fixed effects for selected environmental factors and random effects to capture temporal trends, zone specific seasonal patterns, spatial trends at the zone level, and the presence of An. stephensi and its impact. Results Our negative binomial regression model highlighted 56% variability in the data and slightly more than half (55%) was due to environmental factors, while the remainder was captured by random effects. A significant nationwide decline in malaria risk was observed between 2013 and 2018, followed by a sharp increase in early 2022. Malaria risk was higher in western and northwestern zones of Ethiopia compared to other zones. Zone-specific seasonal patterns, not explained by environmental factors, were grouped into four clusters of seasonal behaviours. The presence of An. stephensi was not shown to have any significant impact on malaria risk. Conclusions Understanding the spatial and temporal drivers of malaria transmission and therefore identifying more appropriate malaria control strategies are key to the success of any malaria elimination and eradication programmes in Ethiopia. Our study found that approximately 50% of malaria risk variability could be explained by environmental, temporal, and spatial factors included in the analysis, while the remaining variation was unexplained and may stem from other factors not considered in this study. This highlights the need for a better understanding of underlying factors driving local malaria transmission and outbreaks, to better tailor regional programmatic responses. Graphical Abstract

N2  - The purpose of this review article is to explore the drivers of the water quality problems and associated impacts and mitigation schemes of the fishes and fisheries in Ethiopia. Data were obtained from both published and unpublished online documents as well as from different Ethiopian universities and institutions. The country has the potential to produce more fish yield (94, 500 ton/year. The published and unpublished documents stated that the fishes and water bodies utilized are under stress such as textile industry, floriculture industry, tannery industry, high population growth, irrigation, application of agrochemicals, deforestation around the watershed, types of fishing gears, fishing methods, socio-economic factors, lack of facilities and infrastructure, ineffective administration setup, invasive weeds, land use around the fish habitats. However, the demand for fish is increasing at an alarming rate time to time. For this reason, good management setup for stakeholders particularly those communities settled around the watershed awareness is critical to sustain fish and water resources for the upcoming generation in the country. &nbsp; Key words: Ethiopia, fishery, management, watershed, water quality.

N2  - One of the most challenging duties in an agricultural field is weed control. Weed control is a major problem for peasant framers everywhere. This paper's objectives are to reviewing and reporting the weed management practices utilized in Ethiopian agriculture and to recommend the viability of mechanizing weeding operations for the further research. In agriculture, three weed management techniques are frequently used. These are chemical, mechanical, and manual control. Farmers that are convinced of its benefits quickly adopt mechanical weed control. In addition to pulling weeds out from between the rows of crops, mechanical weed management maintains the soil's top loose, improving soil aeration and water absorption. Mechanical weeding saves time and labor while lowering labor costs also. Some weeding tools that are powered by animals are effective in terms of time and money savings. Herbicides are occasionally used by farmers; however, they are not often used in farming. In conclusion, weed control is one of the most essential and expensive operation in agriculture. Weeding by mechanical device reduces the cost of labour and also saves time than any other methods of weed control. Therefore, instead of manual weeding and using chemicals, the use of a mechanical weeding machine should be given priority.

N2  - Field experiments involving sprawling and erect cultivars of sugarcane and 12 weed competition periods were conducted in randomized complete block design in four replications for two cropping seasons at three sugarcane plantations of Ethiopia. Sugarcane was either kept free of weeds or weeds were allowed to grow for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 weeks after planting (WAP). The sprawling sugarcane cultivars ('B41227' and 'N14') suppressed weed growth more and gave higher cane yield than the erect cultivar 'NCo334'. The cane yield loss in unweeded plots compared to weed free plots ranged from 69.7% for sprawling cultivar 'B41227' at Methara to 83.5% at Wonji-Shoa for the erect cultivar 'NCo334'. The beginning and end of critical periods of weed interference on 5% acceptable cane yield loss levels ranged from about 2.5 to 14 WAP for the erect cultivar and from 3 to 13.5 WAP for the sprawling cultivars implying the need to use herbicides or other weed control methods in sugarcane plantations of Ethiopia during these periods to keep cane yield loss levels below 5%.

N2  - Wheat is one of the most important food security crops which is cultivated from small to large scale farms in Ethiopia. However, its productivity has been limited due to various abiotic and biotic factors including weeds. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of seed rates and post emergence herbicides application on weed management and productivity of wheat. Factorial combinations of three levels of seed rates (100,150 and 200 kg ha -1 )and four types of herbicides (Agro 2,4-D 720 g/L 1lt ha -1 ,Pallas 45 OD 0.5lt ha -1 ,Derby 175 SC 100ml ha -1 and Lancolet 450 WG 33 gm ha -1 )along with control (a weedy check) were laid out in RCBD with three replications. A total of identified 12 weed species were recorded (86 % broad and 14 % grass weeds). Results also revealed that significant effects of seed rate by herbicide interaction for all the traits studied. The minimum weed densities (2.7 m -2 ) at 45 days after planting , dry biomass of grass weeds (33.33 kg ha -1 ) and the highest weed control efficiency (81.22%) were recorded from the interaction effects of 150 seed rate with Pallas 45 OD while the minimum dry biomass of broad leaf weeds (53.33 kg ha -1 ) was recorded at 200 kg ha -1 seed rate with Lancolet 450 Wattable Granule (WG). The highest number of productive tillers(133.33 m -2 ),seeds per spike(76.48), thousand grain weight (44.36 g),grain yield (4516.42 kg ha -1 )and biological yield(13100 kg ha -1 ) were recorded from the combination of 150 kg ha -1 seed rate with Pallas 45 OD while the lowest values were observed from the weedy check .Grain yield had strong positive correlations with each of the yield components, however it was negatively correlated with dry weed biomass. Based on partial budget analysis, the maximum net benefit was obtained from the interaction of 150 kg ha -1 seed rate with Pallas 45 OD but higher number of marginal rate of return was calculated from 150 kg ha -1 seed rate with 2,4-D . It was also observed that, the combined use of seed rate 150 kg ha -1 with Pallas 45 OD effectively managed weeds, economical and gave maximum yields, which could be recommended for the test environment. Since the experiment was conducted in one location and for a single season, it should be repeated over seasons or multi locations for best recommendation.

N2  - Wheat is one of staple and major food security crops which can be cultivated from small to large scale farms in Ethiopia.Therefore, the aim is to determine influence of weed and other abiotic stresses on wheat production under rain fed and irrigated areas.It was rich sources of different nutrients which contain higher percentage of starch followed by protein and other types of nutrients.Traditionally, the crop is used for making bread, Dabokolo, porridge, Kinche and other types of foods.The straw is good source for animal feed and also used for thatching roofs in rural areas.Wheat production was limited due to various biotic and abiotic factors.Many varieties of wheat were released by agricultural research institute in Ethiopia that were suited for different soil types and climatic conditions.The crop competes with weeds for various growth resources like nutrient, light, Carbon dioxide, space, moisture etc. during its growth.The competition can be intra and inter specific completion.Planting densities can determine plant population in the field.Planting fewer seeds below the recommendation in the plots may exert severe competition of weeds but planting of higher seed rates created problem of lodging, disease infestation and rat damage.Increased plant density per unit area achieved by higher seed rates probably caused smothering of weeds and consequently reduced their dry matter.Weed competition is most serious when the crop is young and at active growth stage.Weed losses in wheat may occur from initial stages to the last stage of maturity, harvest, threshing, winnowing and storing of wheat grains.Weeds can be controlled by different methods but chemical weed control in wheat was best in producing higher grain yield than hand weeding.A wide variety of herbicides are available for both annual grassy and broadleaf weed control in wheat.Application of grassy and broad leaf herbicides increased grain yield and yield components of wheat.Several investigations were made for the management of weeds in wheat fields.Studies on annual weeds control in wheat was done by many researchers in Ethiopia as well as outside the country but still there is yield gaps. Therefore , further study on weed management in wheat will be needed for various weed flora throughout the country.

N2  - There has been recent large scale-up of malaria control interventions in Ethiopia where transmission is unstable. While household ownership of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) has increased greatly, there are concerns about inadequate net use. This study aimed to investigate factors associated with net use at two time points, before and after mass distribution of nets.Two cross sectional surveys were carried out in 2006 and 2007 in Amhara, Oromia and SNNP regions. The latter was a sub-sample of the national Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS 3R). Each survey wave used multi-stage cluster random sampling with 25 households per cluster (224 clusters with 5,730 households in Baseline 2006 and 245 clusters with 5,910 households in MIS 3R 2007). Net ownership was assessed by visual inspection while net utilization was reported as use of the net the previous night. This net level analysis was restricted to households owning at least one net of any type. Logistic regression models of association between net use and explanatory variables including net type, age, condition, cost and other household characteristics were undertaken using generalized linear latent and mixed models (GLLAMM).A total of 3,784 nets in 2,430 households were included in the baseline 2006 analysis while the MIS 3R 2007 analysis comprised 5,413 nets in 3,328 households. The proportion of nets used the previous night decreased from 85.1% to 56.0% between baseline 2006 and MIS 3R 2007, respectively. Factors independently associated with increased proportion of nets used were: LLIN net type (at baseline 2006); indoor residual spraying (at MIS 3R 2007); and increasing wealth index at both surveys. At both baseline 2006 and MIS 3R 2007, reduced proportion of nets used was independently associated with increasing net age, increasing damage of nets, increasing household net density, and increasing altitude (>2,000 m).This study identified modifiable factors affecting use of nets that were consistent across both surveys. While net replacement remains important, the findings suggest that: more education about use and care of nets; making nets more resistant to damage; and encouraging net mending are likely to maximize the huge investment in scale up of net ownership by ensuring they are used. Without this step, the widespread benefits of LLIN cannot be realized.

N2  - Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) is caused by Dracunculus medinensis, a parasitic worm.Approximately 1 year after a person acquires infection from contaminated drinking water, the worm emerges through the skin, usually on the lower limb.Pain and secondary bacterial infection can cause temporary or permanent disability that disrupts work and schooling.The campaign to eradicate dracunculiasis worldwide began in 1980 at CDC.In 1986, the World Health Assembly called for dracunculiasis elimination (1), and the global Guinea Worm Eradication Program, led by the Carter Center and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), CDC, and other partners, began assisting ministries of health in countries where dracunculiasis was endemic.In 1986, an estimated 3.5 million cases occurred each year in 20 countries in Africa and Asia (1,2).Since then, although the goal of eradicating dracunculiasis has not been achieved, considerable progress has been made.Compared with the 1986 estimate, the annual number of reported cases in 2015 has been reduced by 99% and cases are confined to four endemic countries.This report updates published (3-5) and unpublished surveillance data reported by ministries of health and describes progress toward dracunculiasis eradication from January 2014 through June 2015.During 2014, a total of 126 cases were reported from four countries (Chad [13 cases], Ethiopia [three], Mali [40], and South Sudan [70]), compared with 148 cases reported in 2013, from the same four countries.The overall 15% reduction in cases during 2013-2014 was less than that experienced in recent years, but the rate of decline increased again to 70% in the first 6 months of 2015 compared with the same period during 2014.Continued active surveillance with aggressive detection and appropriate management of cases are essential program components; however, epidemiologic challenges and civil unrest and insecurity pose potential barriers to eradication.Because the life cycle of D. medinensis is complex, its transmission can be interrupted using several strategies (4).Dracunculiasis can be prevented with four main interventions: 1) educating residents in communities where the disease is endemic, particularly persons from whom worms are emerging, to avoid immersing affected body parts in sources of drinking water; 2) filtering potentially contaminated drinking water through a cloth filter or pipe filter; 3) treating potentially contaminated surface water with the insecticide temephos (Abate) to kill the copepods (small crustaceans that host D. medinensis larvae); and 4) providing safe drinking water from bore-hole or protected hand-dug wells (6).Containment of transmission* is

N2  - Tef head smudge disease caused by <i>Helmintosporium</i> <i>miyakei</i> is among the widely distributed tef disease in Ethiopia. Currently, an evaluation of different fungicides for the control of tef head smudge and yield loss quantification is very crucial. Therefore, this study aimed to identify effective fungicide(s) for the control of head smudge disease and quantify yield loss caused by this pathogen in the country. The experiment was conducted at the Negelle Arsi on farmers' field from the 2020 to 2021 short rainy seasons. The application of different fungicides created significantly different levels of severity of head smudge disease on tef varieties Boset and Tesfa. The two varieties are susceptible to head smudge and enabled the assessment of the effects of head smudge disease on tef grain yield, severity of the disease, and yield loss during the short rainy seasons. The analysis of variance revealed that there was no statistically significant difference among the Rex Duo and Nativo 300 SC fungicides for tef yield but the highest grain yield was obtained through the application of Rex Duo (2431.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). The fungicide efficacy of 77.1 and 60.9% were obtained through the application of Rex Duo and Nativo 300 SC fungicides, respectively. The result revealed that the maximum yield loss of 55.8 and 50% was prevented through the application of the fungicides Rex Duo and Nativo 300 SC, respectively. It is recommended that based on the availability in the market and cost of fungicide Rex Duo and Nativo 300 SC the farmers can apply either Rex Duo or Nativo 300 SC in controlling head smudge disease of tef.

N2  - Wheat yellow rust disease caused by <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> is one of the most feared and wheat production bottlenecks in the highland areas of Ethiopia. Field experiment was conducted to assess wheat yield losses caused by <i>Puccinia striiformis</i> f. sp. <i>tritici</i> based at optimal frequency of fungicide with wheat varieties for the control of stripe rust at hotspot environments of Meraro and Bekoji, experimental stations in Arsi zone in 2017 main cropping season. Results revealed that there was direct linkage between the disease level and the yield loss in the most common commercially adopted bread wheat varieties. There was varying resistance level among different wheat varieties. The extensively cultivated wheat variety, Wane was found to be most resistant with minimum yield loss of 22.9 to 39.7% followed by Lemu and Danda'a with yield loss of 48.7to 56.5% and43.3 to 57.5% at Bekoji and Meraro respectively. While Kubsa, proved to be the most susceptible wheat variety with maximum yield loss of 91.5 to 96.7% at Bekoji and Meraro respectively. Therefore, it is advisable to use resistant varieties with appropriate fungicides with optimal frequency in order to reduce yield loss and get comparable yield advantage by reducing the incurring of wheat stripe rust in wheat farms.

N2  - Optimal use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) to prevent malaria in a community depends on vector behavior, mass distribution, knowledge and willingness of people to use the nets. This study was aimed at evaluating knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) about ITNs at household level in rural sub-distracts of Kolla Tembien. For this purpose, interview questionnaire containing KAP variables were administered to the randomly selected household heads. A total of 368 households were surveyed, and 70.10 % of the respondents were females. The X number of occupants in the households surveyed was found to be 5.50. However, the X number of ITNs owned by the households was found to be 1.07. Most of the respondents (82.34%) indicated ITNs prevent malaria through protection from mosquito bites. Seventy six percent of the respondents claimed children < 5 years of age should be given priority to sleep under ITN in the household. Only few respondents, 1.63%, considered pregnant women as priority groups to sleep under ITNs. Furthermore, about 63% of the respondents showed their willingness to buy ITNs if they are affordable. The responses by male and female household heads to most of the KAP questions were not significantly different (P > 0.05). Out of the 260 nets inspected for usage and physical condition during the survey period, more than 50% were kept in a box or other container in the households. Nets that were graded as clean and very dirty accounted for 25% and 25.77%, respectively. Physical inspection of the randomly sampled nets also revealed holes ranging from those that didn't allow a thumb to pass through (X number = 3.47) to those that were wider than a closed fist (X number = 1.64). The over all knowledge, attitude and practice of ITN usage was found to be satisfactory in the study district. However, the occupant net ratio must be narrowed and attention needs to be given to malaria vulnerable groups in the household. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of net usage after distribution should be instituted to avoid misuses and associated net damages in the study areas.

N2  - Improved potato varieties can increase potato yields of smallholders, and thus contribute to food security improvement in Ethiopia. However, the uptake of these varieties by farmers is very limited so far and this is one of the causes of insufficient seed quality in the seed potato system in Ethiopia. The low uptake may be related to the high costs of recommended production methods for these varieties. The objective of this study was to formulate least-cost seed potato production methods for farmers in Ethiopia. The paper used integer linear programming to determine these least-cost seed potato production methods, using published data on the perceived contributions to seed tuber yield and quality of different cultivation and post-harvest management options, and calculated seed potato production cost data for the different options. For the potato-growing districts Jeldu and Welmera, several seed potato production methods were formulated from which farmers can choose an affordable method that will enable them to produce seed potato with reasonable yield and quality levels. Results showed that yield and quality levels could be simultaneously improved at relatively low extra costs, for example, by applying recommended fertilizer rate combined with two fungicide applications. In both districts, most methods were robust to 50% increases in the rental values of land, prices of seed, wage rates, and prices of agrochemicals. Findings can be used by potato development practitioners to advise farmers on the adoption of seed potato technologies that are compatible with their financial resources.

N2  - Endosulfan, a mixture of α-and β-isomers, is used by farmers in the wet and dry season for khat and onion production. Khat leaf samples were collected in farmer fields at intervals of 1 h; 1, 5, 9 and 14 d after application. The dissipation rate of α-and β-isomers and residue level in khat were compared with residue levels in onion. The extraction was done by using Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) method and analyzed by Gas Chromatography-Electron Capture Detector (GC-ECD). Greater residue α-and β-isomer endosulfan levels were found in khat compared to onion as khat leaves are sprayed repeatedly in two week. Residue levels of khat exceeded the tolerable EU limit of 0.05 mg.kg −1 for leafy vegetables and herbs. For both raw and processed onion sample α-and β-endosulfan residues level were below the tolerable of limit EU regulation for bulb vegetables (i.e. 0. 1 mg.kg −1). The mean half-life for the α-isomer of endosulfan was 3.4 d in the wet season and 3.6 d in the dry season whilst that for the β-isomer was 5.0 d and 5.4 d respectively. Both isomers dissipated fastest in the wet season under conditions of high humidity and precipitation. The β-isomer persisted longer and had a lower dissipation rate from plants surface compared to the α-isomer.

N2  - Background Malaria remains a key contributor to mortality and morbidity across Africa, with the highest burden in children under 5. Insecticide-based vector control tools, which target the adult Anopheles mosquitoes, are the most efficacious tool in disease prevention. Due to the widespread use of these interventions, insecticide resistance to the most used classes of insecticides is now pervasive across Africa. Understanding the underlying mechanisms contributing to this phenotype is necessary to both track the spread of resistance and to design new tools to overcome it. Methods Here, we compare the microbiota composition of insecticide-resistant populations of Anopheles gambiae, An. coluzzii and An. arabiensis from Burkina Faso, and in the latter case additionally from Ethiopia, to insecticide-susceptible populations. Results We show that the microbiota composition between insecticide-resistant and-susceptible populations does not differ in Burkina Faso. This result is supported by data from laboratory colonies originating in Burkina Faso across two countries. In contrast, An. arabiensis from Ethiopia demonstrates clear differences in microbiota composition in those dying from and those surviving insecticide exposure. To further understand resistance in this An. arabiensis population, we performed RNAseq and saw differential expression of detoxification genes associated with insecticide resistance and changes in respiration, metabolism and synapse-related ion channels. Conclusions Our results indicate that, in addition to changes in the transcriptome, microbiota can contribute to insecticide resistance in certain settings.

N2  - Introduction. Farmers use a large number of pesticides to increase the productivity of Khat cultivation. Since Khat is consumed by many Ethiopians as a habit, there may be a significant concentration of pesticide residues in Khat leaves which result in adverse effects among the exposed population. Excess use of pesticides in Khat causes cancer, genotoxicity, and endocrine disturbances. current study aimed to determine the concentration of selected pesticide residues on Khat leaves samples and to estimate the possible health risk on consumers. Methods. .irty Khat samples were collected from Khat cultivators in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. Pesticide residue extraction and cleanup of Khat samples were performed using the QuEChERS method. Data were also collected about personal variables and Khat consumption habits. .e pesticide concentrations were determined and the health risks were estimated. Results. Profenofos, dimethoate, and chlorpyrifos were detected in 6 (20%), 24 (80%), and 28 (93.3%) Khat samples, respectively. However, diazinon was detected in two samples and endosulfan I was not detected. .e average concentration of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, profenofos, and diazinon in Khat samples was 75.39 ± 20.26, 130 ± 48.94, 242.45 ± 119.79, and 81.5 ± 21.0 μg/kg, respectively. .e HQ for diazinon was greater than 1 which shows the chronic health risks associated with intake of diazinon among Khat chewers. .e acute health risks associated with intake of profenofos and diazinon were minimal. Discussion. Pesticide residue exposure is a risk factor for cardiac complications, reduction in antioxidant defense system, and developing neurological symptoms. All the pesticides were higher than the European Union Maximum Residue Levels (EU-MRL). Diazinon has the potential to cause higher chronic health risks. Chronic Khat chewers in the region may face potential health risks from pesticide residues. Awareness creation among people in the study area is necessary to avoid the adverse health effects of pesticide residues.

N2  - Food safety is an area of growing worldwide concern on account of its direct bearing on human health. Pesticides are widely used in agriculture mainly to increase crop yields to cater huge supply of food products for increasing world population as well as to protect crops from pests and control insect-borne diseases. Increased use of pesticides results in contamination of the environment and the excess accumulation of pesticide residues in food products, which has always been a matter of serious concern. Pesticide residues in food and crops are directly related to the irrational application of pesticides to the growing crops. Considering this, present review is presented with the objective to determine which pesticides are being used by the farmers and also the presence of different pesticide residues in different food crops. This review paper analysed a total of 16 research articles published in journals in quantification of different pesticide residues in different food crops grown in Ethiopia. Most of the pesticide residues which are studied repetitively in Ethiopia are Heptachlor, Aldrin, Chlordane, Endosulfan sulphate, Dimethoate, Diazinon, Malathion, Chlorpyrifos, p,p'-DDE, o,p' DDT and p,p' DDT. Accumulated pesticide residues in food products have been associated with a broad variety of human health hazards, ranging from short-term effects to long term toxic effects. The impact of pesticide residues can be minimized by taking certain measures such as the rational use of pesticides, promoting organic farming, exploit natural and bio-pesticides, and proper implementation and amendment of pesticide-related laws.

N2  - Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium spp. is an emerging destructive wheat disease in Ethiopia. This disease significantly reduces grain yield and quality leading to small, shriveled, lightweight kernels and subsequently contaminating the grain with mycotoxins, particularly deoxynivalenol (DON). Field experiments were conducted in Mareko district, southern Ethiopia during the 2020 and 2021 main cropping seasons to determine the impact of integrated wheat variety resistance and fungicide application against FHB development and associated DON. Three bread wheat varieties (Denda'a, Hidase, and Kingbird), two fungicides (propiconazole and tebuconazole), and untreated wheat were used as a treatment in a split-plot design arranged in three replications. The main plots received wheat varieties, while the subplots received fungicides. The effect of fungicides on the FHB severity index was highly significant. Propiconazole and tebuconazole spraying at the anthesis growth stage reduced FHB incidence, severity, Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK), and DON contamination in harvested grain while increasing thousand seed weight and yield in all varieties. Kingbird variety sprayed with tebuconazole had low mean FHB disease severity (19.33 and 20.20%), disease progression (0.0065 and 0.0079 units day–1), and AUDPC (316.52 and 330.17%-days) in 2020 and 2021, respectively. High mean grain yields were also obtained from a variety of Kingbird sprayed with tebuconazole. Furthermore, fungicide efficacy was found to be higher in the Kingbird variety treated with tebuconazole, with a 67% DON contamination reduction compared to the control. Unsprayed plots of each variety had the highest disease severity, DON contamination, AUDPC, and the lowest grain yield in both cropping years. The efficacy of fungicides in reducing the FHB severity index and yield increase was lower in the susceptible variety (Denda’a). Grain yield was negatively correlated to severity index, FDK, and DON, whereas the latter traits were positively correlated among themselves. The study indicated that fungicide efficacy in reducing FHB, and increasing grain yield was higher in moderately resistant varieties than in susceptible ones. The results imply that integrating fungicide application at the anthesis growth stage with moderately resistant variety is a more effective management approach for reducing FHB and DON contamination in wheat, than either approach used alone, and increasing wheat production and food security in major wheat growing areas of Ethiopia.

T1:No plot was sprayed with fungicide at 4 day irrigation interval; T2 :No plot was sprayed with fungicide at 10 day irrigation interval;T3 :plot was sprayed 9 times with fungicide at 4 days irrigation interval;T4: plot was sprayed 5 times with fungicide at 4 days irrigation interval; T5:plot was sprayed 9 times with fungicide at 6 days irrigation interval; T6 :plot was sprayed 5 times with fungicide at 6 days irrigation interval; T7: plot was sprayed 7 times with fungicide at 10 days irrigation interval;T8: plot was sprayed 9 times with fungicide at 10 days irrigation interval;T9:plot was sprayed 7 times with fungicide at 4 days irrigation interval; T10: plot was sprayed 7 times with fungicide at 8 days irrigation interval; T11: plot was sprayed 7 times with fungicide at 6 days irrigation interval; T12: No plot was sprayed with fungicide at 8 days irrigation interval; T13:plot was sprayed 9 times with fungicide at 8 days irrigation interval; T14: plot was sprayed 5 times with fungicide at 10 days irrigation interval; T15: no plot was sprayed with fungicide at 6 days irrigation interval; T16: plot was sprayed 5 was recorded in treatment thirteen T13 where 9 sprayed fungicide and applied at 8 day irrigation interval. The highest PDI (96.3%) was counted in treatment one (T1). Application of combined fungicide and irrigation interval has reduced the disease severity significantly, while irrigation alone had no significant effect on disease infection. But there was a decreasing of the disease severity with increasing irrigation frequency.

N2  - The overuse of pesticides has resulted in the accumulation of harmful residues in vegetables, which requires monitoring to assess the risks to human health. This article presents the levels of 35 pesticide residues in 15 composite vegetable samples from irrigated farmlands adjacent to Lake Ziway, Ethiopia, using the QuEChERS extraction method (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) and then analyzes them using GC-MS. The study also estimated the health risks associated with the consumption of contaminated vegetables in children and adults, including carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks. The predominant pesticide residues found in tomatoes were α-endosulfan (0.58 mg/kg), β-BHC (0.04 mg/kg), heptachlor (0.02 mg/kg), and malathion (0.03 mg/kg), all of which were above the safety limits. Similarly, the mean concentration of heptachlor epoxide (0.04 mg/kg) and propargite (0.11 mg/kg) was higher than the allowed levels of the safety limits for onions. The concentration of pesticide residues detected in 10.6% and 7.9% of tomato and onion samples was above the maximum residual limits of the European Commission (EU-MRLs), respectively. Noncarcinogenic health risk estimates show that onion heptachlor epoxide had THQ > 1, indicating the possibility of systemic health risk in both adult and child consumers. The carcinogenic health risk (CHR) showed that heptachlor epoxide in adults and children and only heptachlor in children had CHR > acceptable limit (10-4) for tomato and onion. Therefore, it is critical to raise awareness among stakeholders while simultaneously implementing sound monitoring policy actions to protect the ecosystem and the health of the population in the study area and beyond.

N2  - Background: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) remain the cornerstones of malaria vector control. However, the development of insecticide resistance and its implications for operational failure of preventative strategies are of concern. The aim of this study was to characterize insecticide resistance among Anopheles arabiensis populations in Ethiopia and describe temporal and spatial patterns of resistance between 2012 and 2016. Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, resistance status of An. arabiensis was assessed annually during the long rainy seasons in study sites from seven of the nine regions in Ethiopia. Insecticide resistance levels were measured with WHO susceptibility tests and CDC bottle bioassays using insecticides from four chemical classes (organochlorines, pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamates), with minor variations in insecticides tested and assays conducted between years. In selected sites, CDC synergist assays were performed by pre-exposing mosquitoes to piperonyl butoxide (PBO). In 2015 and 2016, mosquitoes from DDT and deltamethrin bioassays were randomly selected, identified to species-level and screened for knockdown resistance (kdr) by PCR. Results: Intense resistance to DDT and pyrethroids was pervasive across Ethiopia, consistent with historic use of DDT for IRS and concomitant increases in insecticide-treated net coverage over the last 15 years. Longitudinal resistance trends to malathion, bendiocarb, propoxur and pirimiphos-methyl corresponded to shifts in the national insecticide policy. By 2016, resistance to the latter two insecticides had emerged, with the potential to jeopardize future long-term effectiveness of vector control activities in these areas. Between 2015 and 2016, the West African (L1014F) kdr allele was detected in 74.1% (n = 686/926) of specimens, with frequencies ranging from 31 to 100% and 33 to 100% in survivors from DDT and deltamethrin bioassays, respectively. Restoration of mosquito susceptibility, following pre-exposure to PBO, along with a lack of association between kdr allele frequency and An. arabiensis mortality rate, both indicate metabolic and target-site mutation mechanisms are contributing to insecticide resistance. Conclusions: Data generated by this study will strengthen the National Malaria Control Programme's insecticide resistance management strategy to safeguard continued efficacy of IRS and other malaria control methods in Ethiopia.

N2  - Introduction. Farmers use a large number of pesticides to increase the productivity of Khat cultivation. Since Khat is consumed by many Ethiopians as a habit, there may be a significant concentration of pesticide residues in Khat leaves which result in adverse effects among the exposed population. Excess use of pesticides in Khat causes cancer, genotoxicity, and endocrine disturbances. The current study aimed to determine the concentration of selected pesticide residues on Khat leaves samples and to estimate the possible health risk on consumers. Methods. Thirty Khat samples were collected from Khat cultivators in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. Pesticide residue extraction and cleanup of Khat samples were performed using the QuEChERS method. Data were also collected about personal variables and Khat consumption habits. The pesticide concentrations were determined and the health risks were estimated. Results. Profenofos, dimethoate, and chlorpyrifos were detected in 6 (20%), 24 (80%), and 28 (93.3%) Khat samples, respectively. However, diazinon was detected in two samples and endosulfan I was not detected. The average concentration of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, profenofos, and diazinon in Khat samples was 75.39 ± 20.26, 130 ± 48.94, 242.45 ± 119.79, and 81.5 ± 21.0 μg/kg, respectively. The HQ for diazinon was greater than 1 which shows the chronic health risks associated with intake of diazinon among Khat chewers. The acute health risks associated with intake of profenofos and diazinon were minimal. Discussion. Pesticide residue exposure is a risk factor for cardiac complications, reduction in antioxidant defense system, and developing neurological symptoms. All the pesticides were higher than the European Union Maximum Residue Levels (EU-MRL). Diazinon has the potential to cause higher chronic health risks. Chronic Khat chewers in the region may face potential health risks from pesticide residues. Awareness creation among people in the study area is necessary to avoid the adverse health effects of pesticide residues.

N2  - Water resources have been contaminated by pesticides due to the different activities of human beings. Different studies documented that advanced water treatment systems can eliminate pesticides while conventional and household treatment technologies are not well studied. The main aim of the present study is to determine the effect of conventional and household water treatment technologies on the removal of pesticide residue in drinking water. Water samples were collected from the Gibe River (intake point), from each treatment process, and from the distribution system. To determine the effect of the household water treatment process (solar disinfection and boiling), pesticides were spiked into distilled water and then passed through solar disinfection (SODIS) and boiling. The extraction of samples was conducted by following a low-density-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure. The result of the study revealed that almost all studied pesticides except o´p-DDT were detected in water samples. Most pesticides that were detected in water samples from our study areas exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs), except for p,p’-DDE. The percent reduction of pesticide residue after post-chlorination by conventional water treatment ranges from 11.7% (from 70.83 μg/L to 62.54 μg/L) for p´p-DDD to 97.29% (5510.1μg/L to 149.5μg/L) for Dimethachlor, and the percent reduction of pesticide residue by SODIS and boiling ranges from 2.31% (o´p-DDT) to 54.45% (Cypermethrin) and 27.13% (γ-Chlordane) to 38.9% (p´p-DDE) respectively. This indicates that treatment technologies are important for the reduction of pesticides in water. Since studied pesticides are persistent and the resides were exceed MRL (have a health impact), monitoring of pesticides in treatment plant units is necessary and treatment technology improvement is important to allow further removal of pesticides.

N2  - Pesticide use has increased in the Lake Tana sub-basin due to increased agricultural activity, potentially endangering nontargeted organisms. To assess its potential impact on fish health and fish-consuming human populations, pesticide concentrations in the fillet and liver tissue of three fish species, namely Labeobarbus megastoma, Labeobarbus tsanensis, and Oreochromis niloticus, were investigated in Lake Tana. Fish samples were taken from the lake near the rivers of Ribb and Gumara, which flow through agricultural areas where considerable amounts of pesticides have been applied. A total of 96 fish samples were collected. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) revealed the presence of ten pesticides. Pyrimethanil was frequently detected in 96% of liver and 65% of fillet samples at a median concentration of 33.9 µg kg−1 and 19.7 µg kg−1, respectively. The highest concentration of pyrimethanil was found in L. megastoma (1850.0 µg kg−1). Labeobarbus megastoma also had the highest concentration of oxamyl (507.0 µg kg−1) and flazasulfuron (60.1 µg kg−1) detected in the liver tissue. The highest concentration of carbaryl (56.5 µg kg−1) was found in the liver tissue of O. niloticus. Fish tissue samples from the two study sites contained pyrimethanil, oxamyl, carbaryl, and flazasulfuron. Only pyrimethanil showed a statistically significant difference between the two sites and the species L. megastoma and L. tsanensis. The amounts of pesticides found in the fish species pose no direct risk to the health of fish consumer human population. However, the results show that the lake ecosystem needs immediate attention and regular monitoring of the rising pesticide usage in the lake watershed.

N2  - Pesticides are risk factors in human life causing chronic human health effects. They are commonly used across the globe to enhance human endeavors. In Ethiopia, pesticides are widely used by local farmers and governmental organizations for pest control purpose. Pesticide residues in food items have been a concern to the consumers and environment they live in. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the amount of organochlorine and organophosphate pesticide residues in cereal crops in Bench-Sheko Zone, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional laboratory-based study design was employed to determine the amount of pesticide residues. The samples were extracted using a Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) extraction and clean up method. Finally, the extracted samples were injected into gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometer and the types and concentrations of pesticide residues were analyzed. The highest concentration of endosulfan sulfate (0.076 mgkg-1) was detected in rice, followed by dimethoate (0.068 mgkg-1) and p,p′-DDE (0.087 mgkg-1) in sorghum and common millet, respectively, in the samples obtained from the Gurafarda site.The highest concentration of p,p′-DDT (0.133 mgkg-1) was detected in common millet, followed by aldrin (0.082 mgkg-1) and dimethoate (0.077 mgkg-1) in sorghum and common millet, respectively, in the samples obtained from the North Bench site. In addition, aldrin detected in rice, sorghum, and common millet obtained from the three sites was a residue of above the maximum residual limits set by Codex Alimentarius regulations and European Union. The finding shows that an indication of the widespread use of pesticides in cereal crops.

Samples were analyzed for the occurrence of cypermethrin, permethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, DTT and its metabolites, and endosulfan (α, β). In the analytical procedure, the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) extraction methodology with dispersive solid phase extraction clean up (d-SPE) technique was applied. Validation of the QuEChERS method was satisfactory. Recovery percentages of most pesticides were in the range of 70% to 120%, with good repeatability (%relative standard deviation<20). The limit of detection and limit of quantification varied between 0.001μg/g and 0.092μg/g and between 0.002μg/g and 0.307μg/g, respectively. The main pesticides detected were DDT, endosulfan, cypermethrin, and permethrin. All of the pesticides analyzed were detected in red pepper and green coffee bean. Residues of DDT in coffee pulp significantly differed (p<0.01) from other food items except for red pepper. The concentration of pesticides in the food items varied from 0.011mg/kg to 1.115mg/kg. All food items contained 1 or more pesticides. Two-thirds of the samples had residues below corresponding maximum residue limits, and the remaining one-third of samples were above the maximum residue limits. These results indicate the need for a good pesticide monitoring program to evaluate consumer risk for the Ethiopian people. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:1294-1302. © 2014 SETAC.

N2  - Objective: This study aims to assess the prevalence of pesticide use and its occupational exposure among small-scale farmers in the Kellem Wellega Zone of western Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study design using a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 249 small-scale farmers’ households through face-to-face interviews. Statistical analysis such as descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and binary logistic regression analysis was applied, and a P-value <.05 at 95% CI was considered statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of pesticide use was 87.15%. About 44.2%, 40.2%, and 43.8% of the study participants were classified as having poor knowledge, poor practice, and negative attitude toward pesticide use, respectively. Thus, small-scale farmers whose age was greater than 40 years were 7.87 times more likely to be exposed to skin irritation than those whose age was less than 20 years (AOR = 7.87; 95% CI: 1.75-35.45) and skin contact (AOR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15-0.91). Most farmers who were directly involved in agriculture were 2.22 times more likely to be exposed to the inhalation of pesticide chemicals than those involved in another activity (AOR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.14-4.33). Based on educational level, small-scale farmers who have a primary school and above were 81% less likely to inhale pesticide chemicals than those who did not have formal education (AOR = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.09-0.41). Furthermore, low-income small-scale farmers were 2.62 times more likely to be exposed to coughing (AOR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.25-5.51) than high-income participants. Furthermore, farmers with good knowledge were 1.79 times more likely to be exposed to skin irritation than those with poor knowledge (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.0-3.17). Farmers with poor practice were 1.85 times more likely to show coughing symptoms than those with good practice (AOR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08-3.2), and farmers with good practice were 48% less likely to be exposed to headache than those with poor practice (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.31-0.88). Conclusions: This study shows that small-scale farmers were exposed to pesticides through coughing, headache, skin irritation, inhalation, and skin contact. Low level of knowledge, poor practice, job, low income, older age, and educational level.

N2  - Intensive pesticide use increased concern about the potential acute and chronic health effects of pesticides in general and among applicators in particular. This study aims to explore occupational and environmental pesticide exposure and health risks among pesticide applicators and residents. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1,073 individuals. We examined the health effects potentially attributable to pesticide exposure using regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PR). A higher proportion of good knowledge of pesticides [75 vs. 14%; APR = 1.542 (1.358–1.752), p < 0.001] and a higher mean score of perceived health risk of pesticide use [4.21 vs. 3.90; APR = 1.079 (1.004–1.159), p < 0.05] were observed among applicators than residents. A significantly higher proportion of applicators experienced health effects presumably related to pesticide exposure among themselves (36%) than residents (16%), and a higher proportion of them used prescribed drugs in the past 12 months [51 vs. 32%; APR = 1.140 (1.003–1.295), p < 0.05]. Skin irritation, shortness of breath, cough, and dizziness were more likely reported by applicators than residents. Perceived toxicity of currently applied pesticide products, mix pesticides without gloves, regularly maintain and wash sprayer tank after application, occurrence of an incidental splash during mixing and application, and using home-based care after experiencing a symptom presumably due to pesticide exposure were significantly associated with health effects among applicators. Use of face mask and visiting health facility when experiencing a symptom presumably due to pesticide exposure were significantly positively correlated with attending training on the health risks and use of pesticides. A substantial proportion of applicators reported improper use of preventive measures and methods of pesticide waste disposal. These observations point out that applicators can face high health risks of occupational pesticide exposure in Ethiopia. Even trained applicators pursued poor preventive practices; hence, comprehensive practice-oriented in-depth training focusing on safety precautions and proper use of personal protective equipment, and provision of adequate pesticide waste disposal means are crucial interventions.

N2  - Seven pesticides, profenofos, metalaxyl, λ-cyhalothrin, 4,4′-DDT, 4,4′-DDE, and α- and β-endosulfan, were determined in vegetables (tomato, onion) from 20 locations and surface waters from 12 locations in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia. Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) and solid phase extraction (SPE) methods were used for the vegetables and water, respectively. In 2.5% of the tomato samples, profenofos was detected above European maximum residue limits (MRLs), in 12.5% of the samples metalaxyl, and in 2.5% α- and β-endosulfan. In 5% of the onion samples, profenofos was detected above European MRLs, in 7.5% of the onion samples metalaxyl, and in 5% λ-cyhalothrin. In surface water, profenofos was detected at the highest concentration of 2300 μg/L in the Bulbula River, 890 μg/L near the agricultural land north of Lake Ziway (ANLZ-1), 1700 μg/L in the floriculture effluent (FE-1), and 900 μg/L in tap water at the Batu Drinking Water (BDW) supply. These results show that the levels of pesticides are in several cases substantially elevated, and emphasize the need of regular pesticide monitoring programs for surface waters and vegetables in the Ethiopian CRV.

N2  - The food safety of vegetables produced in an urban environment is often questioned due to its proximity to a range of city pressures including road traffic, aircraft corridors, fuel filling stations, and industrial areas. Besides, past urban/industrial activities might have contaminated city soils, namely throughout air pollution deposition. In addition, the agricultural and in particular the horticultural land management practices themselves may lead to potential inputs from inadequate management of applied materials, such as fertilizers, composts and pesticides, as well as household items (e.g. fences, including materials such as paints or asbestos). These products can be an additional source of contamination for soil, water and edible vegetables, with harmful impacts on humans and other species. Moreover, the intrinsic concentration of soils can be high, depending on the chemical composition of the parent-rock (Kabata-Pendias, 2001). In this context, Lisbon Municipality, based on the decision to open, in partnership with the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC), a new public urban allotment garden (UAG) in LNEC campus, a potentially sensitive area due to its proximity to the airport, has decided to promote a protocol to study this situation with the local government “Junta de Freguesia de Alvalade” and, on this scope, enlarge this cooperation to other UAG in the city. This study aimed to analyse the quality of soil, groundand irrigation water, and plant species in UAG, and to correlate its nature and characteristics with their location within the city and the gardening activity. Materials and methods included the quality assessment of wet atmospheric deposition, manure, soil, vadose zone water and plant species, for six UAG in Lisbon. Results were compared with other EU studies (e.g. Hursthouse et al., 2004). As an overall conclusion, despite the fact that concentrations in soils and waters have exceeded the recommended values in some areas, the vegetables rarely presented contamination.

N2  - The purpose of the present work was Mercury determination in river Ravi, different nalas from Lahore, Head Balloki water and their sediments located in Punjab Pakistan in the summer and winter seasons. Tekran-2500 cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometer employed for determination of Hg in water samples and Zeeman mercury analyzer for sediments. The results show highest Hg concentration in Hudiara drain at all three sampling areas in the summer season. Mehmood Booti nala showed high concentration at terminal point before entering into river water with 84.6±28.11 ng/l concentration. Water at Head Balloki showed 67.3±14.51ng/L concentration in the side running water. The river water sampling before the studied point also showed 1.2±0.4 ng/l concentration. Bhek Nala and Farrukhabad Nala showed relatively less concentration of mercury compared to other nalas. The mercury level was found highest in the sediments of Hudiara drain in both seasons. The high concentration in water tends to accumulates in the different organs of the aquatic organisms. in the current study of Tilapia and Labeo rohita shows the order of the concentration from higher to lower was kidney, liver, gills and muscle where in case of tilapia the accumulation order in slightly different starting from gills, kidney, liver and muscle respectively. The level of CAT was decreased in response high concnetration. Mercury treatment stimulated the liver and gill tissue to significantly increase the level of SOD which might be due to synthesis of SOD and addition in the pre-existing SOD level. The MDA level of gills and liver tissue was increased with the increase in the concentration. *Corresponding Author: Muhammad Saleem Khan  samiikhan@yahoo.com Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES) ISSN: 2220-6663 (Print) 2222-3045 (Online) Vol. 8, No. 4, p. 63-72, 2016 http://www.innspub.net J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2016 64 | Hamid et al. Introduction Heavy metals are among the most common environmental pollutants, and their occurrence in water and biota indicate the presence of natural sources, associated with chemical weathering of minerals and soil leaching, or anthropogenic sources that are mainly concerned with industrial and domestic effluents, urban storm, water runoff, landfill, mining of coal and ore, atmospheric sources and inputs rural areas. Water pollution by trace metals is an important factor in both geochemical cycling of metals and in environmental health. The existence of heavy metals in aquatic environments has led to serious concerns about their influence on plant and animal life (Luoma et al., 2008; Förstner and Wittmann, 2012; Ghaleno et al., 2015). Rivers are one of the important fresh water reservoirs and are threatened with the pollution resulting from urban and industrial waste water which is disposed off into rivers without any treatment (Yasar et al., 2010; Khan et al., 2015; Nzeve et al., 2015). Pakistan is blessed with rivers and all of them flow through Punjab province Pakistan. River Ravi arises in Bara Bangal, a branch of the Dhauladhar range of Himalayas in Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh, a state of India and finally enters into Punjab Province of Pakistan after cutting Dhauladhar (Förstner and Wittmann, 2012). Intense pollution contributed by both India and Pakistan is threatening irrigation and ground waters and also terrestrial and aquatic life in River Ravi. About 1307.08 tons of hazardous and untreated waste is going into Ravi on daily basis. The load from district Lahore is 728.75 tons per day. Food chain contamination by heavy metals has become a burning issue in recent years because of their potential accumulation in bio stems through contaminated water, soil and air. Therefore, the study of river ecotoxicity has gained immense importance because of multiple use of river water for human consumption, agriculture and industry (Javed and Hayat, 1999; Rood River, 2012; Damodharan, 2013; Khan et al.,2016). Mercury is among the most toxic elements present in industrial and urban waste water. The major sources of mercury in the environment are increasing due to discharge from hydroelectric, mining, pulp, dental preparation, and paper and cement industries (Luoma et al., 2008; Förstner and Wittmann, 2012). Although most mercury compounds and uses are now banned or about to be banned, however, mercury is still used in thermometers and dental amalgams. Also, mercury can still be found as an additive in old paints for water proofing and marine antifouling (mercuric arsenate), in old pesticides (mercuric chloride in fungicides, insecticides), in wood preservatives (mercuric chloride), cosmetic products, in embalming fluids (mercuric chloride), in germicidal soaps and antibacterial products (mercuric chloride and mercuric cyanide), as mercury-silver-tin alloys and for "silver mirrors" (Clifton, 2007). The estimated emissions of mercury worldwide are reported to be about 2,200 metric tons per annum. Interestingly, one-third of this quantity arises from natural sources and two-third from human activities such as fossil fuels burning and medical wastes. Mercury may exist as inorganic mercury in the form of HgO, Hg+2, or as organic mercury in the form of methyl mercury (MeHg), ethylmercury, and dimethylmercury. All forms of mercury pose risk of toxicity to humans. Analytical speciation is therefore essential to determine the various forms of Hg in order to predict their effects on biological systems including human beings (Boszke et al., 2002; Baeyens et al., 2007; Houston, 2011; Karagas et al., 2012). The accurate determination of Hg and other elements in environmental, biological or medical samples is a very challenging task. Extremely low levels of this metal combined with numerous interferences in the most sensitive analytical techniques are considered to be the major difficulties. The most appropriate techniques for the determination of Hg include inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPJ. Bio. Env. Sci. 2016 65 | Hamid et al. MS), especially in combination with isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), and electro-thermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). However, all of the mentioned techniques suffer from severe limitations which restrict their application to selected samples only in particular some methods work only for a specific type of sample and are inadequate for the analysis of other sample types. For example ICP-OES and ET-AAS can be applied, but imply prior pre-concentration and/or matrix-separation steps to assess Hg and As concentrations at the required trace levels. ICP-MS suffers from matrix induced non-spectral interferences, as well as spectral interferences caused by monoatomic or polyatomic ions produced in the plasma from matrix components (Mandal & Suzuki, 2002; Mukhtar & Limbeck, 2010; Sanchez-Rodas et al., 2010; Azizullah et al., 2011; Yin et al., 2013). The AFS could be of great interest for the determination of Hg in water samples without requiring the use of expensive ultrasensitive multi elemental instrumentation, like ICP-MS (Ammann, 2011). A lot of work has done on the toxicity of heavy metals in aquatic environment nationally and internationally. The heavy metals enter into the aquatic organisms through gills and food web and accumulated in the different organs. After accumulation the metals causes toxicity to oxidative stress leading to the genotoxicity (Khan et al., 2015a; Khan et al., 2015b). In an experiment on Oreochromis mossambicus in Indus River in Mianwali (Pakistan) studies revealed pathological changes in liver and gill tissues, this shows these biomarkers can be employed to evaluate the toxicity of heavy metals in aquatic life (Jabeen and Chaudhry, 2013). In current study, the Hg concentrations has been determined in River Ravi and various sewage and industrial effluents falling into the river, metal bioaccumulation and its effects on antioxidant enzymes was studied. Materials and methods The different waste water falls into River Ravi named Mahmood Booti, Bhek Nala, Farrukh Abad drain, Bakar Mandi Nala and Hudiara drain were selected as sampling points at three locality 1, 2 and 3 for start of nala, at the start of mixing nala waste with river water and at terminal of nala before it drops its wastes in the river respectively where in river water and samples were sampled at three localities including locality-1 middle of river, locality-2 side of river running water and locality-3 standing waters before the entrance of these nalas in the River. Similar sampling was done at head Balloki region. The sampling of water and sediments was done during time period of August, and January, at above mentioned points. The two seasons (summer and winter) were representative of seasonal variation of heavy metal pollution of River Ravi. Additionally, sampling of fresh Ravi water and sediments was also done before the beginning of waste water tributaries in order to check the quality of non-contaminated water. The sampling of water and sediments was done in pre-cleaned 50 ml polypropylene tubes. For cleaning the tubes were soaked well before use in 2% (v/v) HNO3 solution for 24 hours followed by drying in an oven at 70 0C till dryness. The tubes were filled with surface water from river and above mentioned points and preserved by adding HNO3 (1% v/v). Similarly, sediments of river and waste drains were collected at the same points where from water samples were collected. All precautionary measurements were taken during sampling in order to avoid contamination of water and sediment samples from external sources. The samples were transported to lab after sampling. For measurement of as in water samples, about 2 ml Conc. HNO3 was added to 20 ml of water samples taken into Teflon digestion cups followed by heating at 90°C for 1 hour with cover in order to avoid sample losses. This led to the digestion of organ

N2  - Dietary intake of fish containing organic contaminants poses a potential threat to human health. In the present work, an assessment has been carried out to look at the human health risk associated with consumption of fish contaminated with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyles (PCBs) in certain fish species collected from Lake Hawassa, Ethiopia. The health risk assessment was made by comparing the concentrations of OCPs and PCBs in fish muscle tissues with reference doses given in the USEPA guidelines. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), endosulfans, PCBs and chloridanes were identified in fish species collected from Lake Hawassa. The most predominant pesticides were DDTs, with mean concentrations of ∑DDT ranging from 19 to 56 ngg-1 wet weights. The highest concentrations of DDTs were found in Barbus intermedius, representing the highest trophic level. PCBs, DDT and endosulfan concentrations found in B. intermedius exceeded the reference dose for children between the ages of 0-1 year (with hazard index of above 1.0). Therefore, consumption of fish from a high trophic level (e.g. B. intermedius) from Lake Hawassa may pose a special health risk to children. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - The Ethiopian Rift Valley (ERV) lakes region is an agricultural area in Ethiopia with intense year-round irrigated framing where widespread legal and illegal pesticide use was documented. The aim of the study is to assess tissue concentration of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in fillets of fives species of fish from Lake Ziway, an ERV lake. The influence of trophic position and fish size on accumulation of OCPs was investigated. Sample preparation for the analysis of OCPs was done following the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) method and OCPs were analyzed using gas chromatography and compound specification was made using mass spectrometry. Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethanes (DDTs) were dominant among investigated OCPs. 4,4’-dichloro-diphenyl-dichloro-ethylene (p,p’-DDE) was the predominant DDT metabolite constituting about 99.2% of total DDTs. Historic DDT input was suggested as the source of current DDT contamination dominated by p,p’-DDE. Geometric mean value of p,p’-DDE varied from 1.07 to 3.64 ng g–1ww. Species variation in accumulation of p,p’-DDE was found that could result from differences in trophic level, lipid content, age, specific habitat, and feeding habit. Carassius carassius occupying a higher trophic position and with relative high lipid content had the highest p,p’-DDE levels. Positive associations between log-transformed p,p’-DDE, and total length were found for C. carassius and Cyprinus carpio. p,p’-DDE was biomagnified through the local food web. Generally, the levels of DDT in the present study are lower than levels reported from lake Ziway in earlier studies. The present findings may contribute contemporary OCP contamination data in investigated fish species.

N2  - Four field experiments were conducted at the Debre Zeit and Bakelo areas of North Shewa, Ethiopia in 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 to determine the effects of five fungicides on epidemics of white rot (Sclerotium cepivorum), and to identify effective fungicides for its management. Five fungicides: tebuconazole as a clove treatment and supplemented basal spray, benomyl, mancozeb, captan and thiram as a clove treatment were applied to Tseday (G-493) and local garlic cultivars. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. There was an untreated control for each cultivar. The trials were conducted in fields naturally infested with S. cepivorum. Treatment of garlic cloves with tebuconazole at the rate of 2.1 ml kg-1and spray at 0.25 l ha-1 at stem bases resulted in a significant reduction in initial and final white rot incidence, progress rate, and severity on bulbs. Captan at the rate of 4.17 g kg-1and benomyl at 5.2 g kg-1gave a significant reduction in final disease incidence and the disease was reduced by 16% and 24%, respectively, over the control at Bakelo. At Debre Zeit these fungicides decreased final disease incidence by 40-44%. The highest increase in marketable yield was obtained from garlic treated with tebuconazole (43-73%), captan (48-77%) and benomyl (42-64%) more than the control. Thiram reduced the disease initially, but subsequently did not prove effective. Garlic yield of both cultivars were improved by fungicide application. On average marketable yield increased 27-44.1% at Debre Zeit and 33-70% at Bakelo over the untreated control plots. Differences existed between seasons and locations and these could be due to differences in environment and inoculum levels. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Tomato is one of the most popular vegetables grown throughout the world in general and in Ethiopia in particular. Production of the crop is constrained by different diseases and the disease caused by the early blight pathogen, Alternaria solani, is among the major ones. Early blight has been considered as commonly occurring and causing a significant economic impact on the yield and quality of the crops. Major tomato diseases in general and early blight, in particular, could be best managed by integrating a number of control practices and the application of fungicides. The application of fungicides is the most convenient and predominant way for disease control in the absence of resistant varieties. The present study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of some selected fungicides with the objectives to assess in vitro efficacy of fungicides on the growth and sensitivity of pathogens, in vitro tolerance of pathogens to fungicides, and their effectiveness as potential foliar sprays against A. solani. A. solani was isolated from tomatoes showing typical early blight symptoms. Five fungicides viz. URGI 75% WP, Carbancholar 50%, Orozole 25 EC, Agro Laxyl MZ 63.5 WP, and Mancodex Super 72 WP were tested against the pathogen using poisoned food technique. The highest percentage reduction in the growth of A. solani was recorded with Orozole 25 EC followed by Agro Laxyl MZ 63.5 WP resulting in 100% and 56.5% inhibition in mycelial growth respectively. On the other hand, Carbancholar 50% was found the least effective in reducing the mycelial growth of A. Solani. Fungicides that showed better in vitro efficacy could be further tested for their efficacies under field conditions and can be verified for economic validity. The study also showed the potential effectiveness of fungicides for the management of early blight on tomatoes.

N2  - The common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., is one of the most important sources of protein in Ethiopia and other developing countries. However, the Mexican bean weevil, Zabrotes subfasciatus (Boheman), is a major constraint of stored common bean that causes qualitative and quantitative losses. This study was conducted to assess farmers' knowledge and perceptions of Mexican bean weevil, to examine farmers' pest management practices, and to identify challenges of pest management practices to develop integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. A survey of 148 smallholder common bean farmers was conducted at Mareka and Loma districts in southern Ethiopia. The majority (75%) of the farmers stored common bean in polypropylene bags while less than 10% of the farmers stored beans in 'Diya' (a traditional storage structure). Most (60.8%) farmers stored their beans in seed (threshed) form, and the majority (63.5%) of them stored their beans for 3-5 months. The majority of the farmers had knowledge about the Mexican bean weevil; they could identify damaged seeds based on the 'holes' on the seed (72.3%) and circular 'windows' on the seed (20.0%). About 45% of the farmers mentioned the high amount of loss at the time of storage. In addition, most farmers (53.4%) estimated 26-50% loss in storage. Most farmers reported the use of pesticidal plants for control of Mexican bean weevil, while only a few farmers reported they had applied insecticide in their store. Education level and family size had a positive and statistically significant impact on the use of pesticidal plants for the control of Mexican bean weevil. Furthermore, education level also influences the use of chemical insecticide. Results highlighted the need to use improved storage technology and to train farmers in postharvest handling practices as a component to develop IPM approach in order to minimize losses occurring along the value chains of the common bean.

N2  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted for Ethiopian rose cultivation. The LCA covered the cradle-to-gate production of all inputs to Ethiopian rose cultivation up to, and including transport to the Ethiopian airport. Primary data were collected about materials and resources used as inputs to, and about the product outputs from 21 farms in 4 geographical regions (i.e. Holleta, Sebeta, Debre Ziet, and Ziway). The primary data were imported in, and analyzed with the SimaPro7.3 software. Data for the production of used inputs were taken from the EcoInvent®2.0 database. Emissions from input use on the farms were quantified based on estimates and emission factors from various studies and guidelines. The resulting life cycle inventory (LCI) table was next evaluated with the CML 2 baseline 2000. V2/world, 1990/characterization method to quantify the contribution of the rose cultivation chain to 10 environmental impact categories. The set of collected primary data was comprehensive and of high quality. The data point to an intensive use of fertilizers, pesticides, and greenhouse plastic. Production and use of these inputs also represent the major contributors in all environmental impact categories. The largest contribution comes from the production of the used fertilizers, specifically nitrogen-based fertilizers. The use of calcium nitrate dominates Abiotic Depletion (AD), Global Warming (GW), Human Toxicity (HT) and Marine Aquatic Ecotoxicity (MAET). It also makes a large contribution to Ozone Depletion (OD), Acidification (AD) and Fresh water Aquatic Ecotoxicity (FAET). Acidification (AC) and Eutrophication (EU) are dominated by the emission of fertilizers. The emissions from the use of pesticides, especially insecticides dominate Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TE) and make a considerable contribution to Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity (FAET) and Photochemical Oxidation (PhO). There is no visible contribution from the use of pesticides to the other toxicity categories. Production and use of greenhouse plastic are another important contributors, and just a bit less than the contribution of calcium nitrate to Abiotic Depletion (AD). The results of this study clearly indicate nutrient management and emissions from pesticide use, especially insecticides, as a focus point for environmental optimization of the rose cultivation sector in Ethiopia. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The intensive use of pesticides is a common practice for the management of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, in greenhouses and field farms of Ethiopia. However, incidence of resistance and possible resistance mechanisms in T. urticae populations from Ethiopia have not yet been studied. Here, we assessed the toxicity of various acaricides—bifenazate, abamectin, emamectin benzoate, profenofos, fenbutatin oxide, fenpyroximate, amitraz and chlorfenapyr—on T. urticae populations sampled from six flower greenhouse farms, three strawberry greenhouse farms, one field-grown vegetable farm and two wild populations. In parallel, all populations were screened for known target-site mutations. All tested populations were fully susceptible to bifenazate, abamectin, emamectin benzoate and profenofos, but resistant against fenbutatin oxide and fenpyroximate. Four populations showed considerable levels of resistance against amitraz and one population was resistant to chlorfenapyr. Several target-site mutations were identified in the tested populations, including G119S, A201S, T280A, G328A and F331W/C/Y in acetylcholinesterase and the F1538I and L1024V mutation in the voltage-gated sodium channel. The F1538I mutation was found in eight out of 12 populations, whereas the L1024V mutation was only found in two populations. The H92R mutation in the PSST subunit of complex I and the I1017F mutation in chitin synthase 1 was detected in half of the tested populations. The G326E and I321T mutations in the glutamate-gated chloride channel 3 were also detected, but more rarely, whereas mitochondrial cytochrome b mutations were not detected. The current study revealed multiple resistance patterns in Ethiopian T. urticae populations and together with the wide presence of target-site mutations, calls for the wise use of acaricides in the management of T. urticae in Ethiopia.

N2  - Surveys were carried out in 2001 in brassica-producing areas of Ethiopia to determine the geographic distribution and severity of diamondback moth (DBM) and occurrence of indigenous parasitoids. Principal component analysis was used to analyse the importance of nine parameters - DBM density, parasitism by different parasitoid species (Oomyzus sokolowskii, Diadegma spp., Apanteles sp. and overall parasitism), cropping systems, pesticide use, frequency of pesticide application and altitude. A total of 194 brassica fields in 13 different areas were visited. Principal component analysis showed that the first two of the nine principal components (largely DBM density and pesticide use) accounted for 70% of the variation in the data set. Higher DBM numbers were associated with pesticide usage and higher overall parasitism with intercropping. Eight parasitoid species were recorded of which three species were important both in distribution and level of parasitism. These include Oomyzus sokolowskii (Hym., Eulophidae), Diadegma spp. (Hym., Ichneumonidae) and Apanteles sp. (Hym., Braconidae). Overall parasitism ranged from 3.6% to 79.5% with big differences between areas. Apanteles sp. and Diadegma spp. were largely confined to the south-western part of Ethiopia where insecticide use is minimal. Oomyzus sokolowskii is mainly distributed in areas of the Rift Valley and northern Ethiopia with relatively heavy insecticide use. This study indicated a huge impact of repeated insecticide treatment and agronomic practices on DBM severity and its parasitoids. © 2006 The Authors.

N2  - Increasing use of current-use pesticides (CUPs) in Africa raises environmental and public health concerns. But there is a large uncertainty about their occurrence and the composition of pesticide mixtures on this continent. This paper investigates the presence of 27 CUPs in air across 20 sampling sites in Africa. 166 passive air samples, consisting of polyurethane foam (PUF), were collected in 12 African countries between 2010 and 2018. Samples were extracted with methanol and analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The detection frequencies of CUPs per site were compared to land use patterns and sampling years, while their similarities were assessed using hierarchical cluster analysis. Overall, 24 CUPs were detected at least once. In 93% of all samples, at least one CUP was detected, while 78% of the samples had mixtures of two or more CUPs (median 3, interquartile range 5). Atrazine and chlorpyrifos were detected in 19 out of 20 sampling sites. Carbaryl, metazachlor, simazine, tebuconazole and terbuthylazine had the highest detection frequencies at sampling sites dominated by croplands. Across all the sampling years, 16 CUPs were present. Seven CUPs were newly detected from 2016 onwards (azinfos-methyl, dimetachlor, chlorsulfuron, chlortoluron, isoproturon, prochloraz and pyrazon), while metamitron was only present before 2012. Sites within a radius of about 200 km showed similarities in detected CUP mixtures across all samples. Our results show the presence of CUP mixtures across multiple agricultural and urban locations in Africa which requires further investigation of related environmental and human health risks.

N2  - In the lowlands of arid and semiarid rangelands woody plants plays an important role in soil fertility maintenance, providing food, medicine, cosmetics, fodder, fuel wood and pesticides. A better understanding of the interaction of woody plants on their immediate environment is needed to guide optimum management of native vegetation in the production landscapes. However, the response of herbaceous vegetation to woody plant species remains poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of two dominant woody plant species (Acacia Senegal and Balanite aegyptica) on herbaceous vegetation in rangelands of eastern Ethiopia. Eighteen trees of relatively the same diameter at breast height were selected to study the effect of the tree on herbaceous vegetation. Vegetation sample data were collected from under canopy and open areas, and analysed for herbaceous vegetation parameters using two ways ANOVA. The herbaceous vegetation parameters under both woody plant species was significantly higher especially with regard to dry matter (101.3±0.97g/m2), basal cover (65.02±0.7%) and species richness (6.9±0.1211 no. species/m2) than the open grassland with dry matter (74.2±0.72g/m2), basal cover (50.53±0.67%) and species richness (5.3±0.11 no. species/m2). The species composition of herbaceous species also showed significant improvements under woody plant canopy with regard to percentage composition of perennial grasses (0.40%) than the open grassland with percentage composition of perennial grasses (0.27%). The positive effect woody plant presence can be also ascribed to some understory species such as Cenchrus ciliaris, Panicum maximum and Eragrostis papposa which have a good pastoral value, grow better under woody plants. Presence of woody plants facilitates the establishment of more palatable herbaceous vegetation under unfavorable climatic conditions that characterize these environments. Therefore, this tree has a significant effect on herbaceous vegetation improvement in resource poor rangelands and as a result, it is important to retain scattered A. Senegal and B. aegyptica plants in the rangelands of eastern Ethiopia.

N2  - Lindane and propoxur residues in some topsoil samples from five cocoa growing districts in the Central Region of Ghana have been determined. Ten soil samples were taken randomly at a depth of 0-10 cm from pre-selected farms in each district. Some physical and chemical properties of the soils were determined. The pesticide residues were extracted from 50 g of topsoil by continuous Soxhlet extraction using a (1:1 v/v) acetone-chloroform mixture for six hours. Clean up of the extract was done by liquid-liquid partitioning and column chromatography using alumina and silica gel adsorbents. The pesticide residues were finally analysed by gas- chromatography using 63Ni electron capture detector (ECD) and flame ionization detector (FID) for lindane and propoxur, respectively. Lindane and propoxur pesticide residues were found to be present in all the soils to which these pesticides had already been applied. Generally, lindane residues occurred in greater amounts than propoxur. The concentrations of lindane ranged from 2.1 to 15.4 mg kg-1 and propoxur from 1.71 to 7.95 mg kg-1. Both the extracted lindane and propoxur residues correlated negatively with pH, cation exchange capacity, moisture content, and organic carbon. Propoxur correlated positively with the amount of clay but there was no significant correlation between the amount of clay and the extracted lindane concentration. © 2006 Chemical Society of Ethiopia.

N2  - Propolis is a natural resin substance produced by honeybees by collecting from parts of plants, buds, and exudates that are used for several biological activities such as antimicrobial, and fungicide functions. This study aimed to analyze the phytochemical, physicochemical, and antimicrobial activity of propolis collected from Boji Dirmaji and Fincha'a districts of western Ethiopia. The physicochemical characteristics, phytochemical screening, and antimicrobial activity of Ethiopian propolis against Aspergillus niger, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated using the disk diffusion method from its essential oils and crude ethanol extract were evaluated based on standard procedures. The results indicated that propolis was rich in saponins, tannins, flavonoids, steroids, triterpenes, and glycosides. Physicochemically, n-hexane extractable substances ranged between 8.6 and 33.9%, resins soluble 14.8–16.8%, insoluble residues 70.8–85.5%, moisture 1.7–4.6%, and ash content 2.8–9.7%, and 4.8 pH. The antimicrobial activities of essential oils propolis were active against Escherichia coli with an average inhibition zone of 18.3 ± 0.52 mm and 18.9 ± 0.06 mm at concentrations of 10 and 20 μl in Dirmaji districts. Moreover, the crude ethanol extracted propolis had nearly the same effect of inhibition to Escherichia coli. However, both crude extract and its essential oils didn't show any activity on Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus niger. The analyzed propolis is promising antimicrobial activity from Gram-negative which is very notorious for people of the world.

N2  - Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and stable isotopes were measured in muscle from 4 bird and 5 fish species from the Ethiopian Rift Valley region where DDT is used for malaria control and vast agricultural activities are carried out. We investigated the bioaccumulation of OCPs such as DDTs, HCHs, chlordanes, and heptachlors between the species, and examined the potential risk posed by these compounds for bird species. Significant differences in contaminant profiles and levels were observed within the species. Levels of total OCPs ranged from 3.7 to 148.7 μg/g lipid in bird and 0.04 to 10.9 μg/g lipid in fish species. DDTs were the predominant contaminant, and a positive relationship between δ15N and ΣDDT concentrations was found. The main DDT metabolite, p,p′-DDE was the most abundant and significantly greater concentrations in bird species (up to 138.5 μg/g lipid), which could have deleterious effects on survival and/or reproduction of birds. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of the present study was to review the biology, social and economic importance of white lupin and generate comprehensive technical information for different scholars who wish to study the crop in detail. White lupin can be used as source of protein for production of protein concentrates, for pharmaceutical purposes, due to the high alkaloid content as a natural component of plant pesticides and ectoparasite control, nitrogen fixation and crop rotation, livestock feed and pasture improvement, ornamentation, erosion control and soil stabilization, for fixing atmospheric nitrogen to soil, as a green manure contributing to improved soil structure, traditional alcohol production and hypertension treatment, live fencing and remediating polluted soils. Having these and other multiple uses, white lupin can contribute to sustainable livelihoods through household food security as it can widen the feed and food basket. © 2012 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

N2  - Pesticides are the parent compounds, their metabolites, and associated impurities of agricultural and health chemical inputs. If they are found at concentration levels higher than the standard limits, they have potential negative impacts on the ecosystem in general and on fish and humans in particular. This study investigates organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) residue occurrences in fish muscle and assesses their public health potential risks, in North West Ethiopia. The concentration of OCPs residue under gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD) was detected in 37.84% of fish muscle samples. The mean amounts detected were Endosalfan I, 341.50 ± 32.19 μg/kg; Endosalfan II, 36.01 ± 2.3 μg/kg; Endosalfan sulfate, 5.43 ± 4.06 μg/kg; 4, 4, DDE (4,4-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), 64.01 ± 9.08 μg /kg; 4,4, DDD (4,4-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane), 5.65 ± 3.12 μg/kg; and 4, 4, DDT (4,4-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), 1.58 ± 0.30 μg/kg. The mean concentration of Endosalfan I tested in fish muscle samples was higher than that of the permissible limit of different international standards. However, due to the low per capita consumption rate of fish origin food in Ethiopia, the health risk index (HRI) ranges from 0.002 to 0.1275, which shows there is no public health risk. This study highlights the possibility of chemical residue occurrence in fish food products, and hence pesticide use regulations and monitoring concentration levels should be implemented regularly to avoid human and environmental health risks.

N2  - Upper Awash Agro Industry Enterprises (UAAIE) is one of the major state farms in Ethiopia with known large-scale pesticide use. Although organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been applied for about three decades, no studies have been carried out on levels of residue in the region. In this work a fast selective pressurised liquid extraction (SPLE) methodology has successfully been applied for screening of 13 OCPs in 12 soil samples from different fields in UAAIE, which further strengthen this methodology. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were done using a dual column gas chromatography-electron capture detection system (GC-ECD) and a GC equipped with a mass spectrometer (MS), respectively. The main contaminants identified comprised of previously used persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and currently used insecticides. Low concentrations or non-detectable levels of certain OCPs (aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and heptachlor) indicate a positive phasing out of these persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Similarly HCHs were found in few soils and at low concentrations. Endosulfans and DDTs were detected in substantial amounts in the soils with Σendosulfans up to 56 000 and ΣDDTs up to 230 ng g-1 dry weight, which is a threat to the surrounding and downstream ecosystems, especially considering that the investigated OCPs constituted 29 000 l of the 63 000 l of pesticide applied annually on the fields. Additional concerns must be raised concerning synergistic effects of all pesticides added. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Teff (Eragrostis tef) is the most important staple cereal food crop in Ethiopia. It accounts for 25% of the annual gross grain production. Teff rust [Uromyces eragrostidis] is the most important and widely distributed teff disease in the country; it causes grain yield losses of 10%–41% annually. Presently, no teff germplasm immune to this disease has been found. The objectives of this study were to determine the resistance of 2000 E. tef landrace accessions and 5000 mutant lines to teff rust and the effects of sowing dates, plant maturity, and fungicides application on teff rust severity. The majority of teff landrace accessions and mutant lines had a high incidence of teff rust infection with susceptible reaction types, i.e., large uredia without chlorosis. None of teff landrace accessions and mutant lines showed complete resistance, but 22 landrace accessions had lower teff rust severity levels. Low rust severity was associated with early sowing dates and early-maturing teff varieties, indicating the beneficial effect of early maturing in escaping the disease. The average yield loss incurred because of teff rust varied from 6% to 33% across three sowing dates. Although, no significant yield differences were observed among the fungicides tested, propiconazole (Tilt® 250 EC and Bumper® 250 EC) was found to reduce more teff rust severity. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - This paper explores the economic implications of fall armyworm (FAW) and its management strategies by exploiting exogenous variation in FAW exposure amongst households in southern Ethiopia. We find that FAW exposure affects maize yield and sales negatively, but not consumption. Furthermore, we find evidence of crowdingin and intensification of insecticide use in response to FAW exposure. We also find suggestive evidence that existing extension service arrangements lack the capacity to deal with emerging threats such as FAW. Results imply that targeted interventions aimed at improving the effectiveness of control measures and institutional capacity would be key to reduce the adverse effects of FAW.

N2  - Improved potato varieties can increase potato yields of smallholders, and thus contribute to food security improvement in Ethiopia. However, the uptake of these varieties by farmers is very limited so far and this is one of the causes of insufficient seed quality in the seed potato system in Ethiopia. The low uptake may be related to the high costs of recommended production methods for these varieties. The objective of this study was to formulate least-cost seed potato production methods for farmers in Ethiopia. The paper used integer linear programming to determine these least-cost seed potato production methods, using published data on the perceived contributions to seed tuber yield and quality of different cultivation and post-harvest management options, and calculated seed potato production cost data for the different options. For the potato-growing districts Jeldu and Welmera, several seed potato production methods were formulated from which farmers can choose an affordable method that will enable them to produce seed potato with reasonable yield and quality levels. Results showed that yield and quality levels could be simultaneously improved at relatively low extra costs, for example, by applying recommended fertilizer rate combined with two fungicide applications. In both districts, most methods were robust to 50% increases in the rental values of land, prices of seed, wage rates, and prices of agrochemicals. Findings can be used by potato development practitioners to advise farmers on the adoption of seed potato technologies that are compatible with their financial resources.

N2  - In the lowlands of arid and semiarid rangelands woody plants plays an important role in soil fertility maintenance, providing food, medicine, cosmetics, fodder, fuel wood and pesticides. A better understanding of the interaction of woody plants on their immediate environment is needed to guide optimum management of native vegetation in the production landscapes. However, the impact of woody plant species on soil properties remains poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of two dominant woody plant species (A. senegal and B. aegyptica) on soil physicochemical properties along grazing gradients in rangelands of eastern Ethiopia. Six trees of each species were selected from light, moderate and heavy grazing sites. Soil sample data at two depths (0-15 and 16-30 cm) were collected from under and open areas of A. senegal and B. aegyptica from each grazing sites, and analysed for nutrient contents. The nutrient status of soil under both woody species was significantly higher especially with regard to soil organic matter (4.37%), total nitrogen (0.313%), and available phosphorus (11.62) than the open grassland with soil organic matter (3.82%), total nitrogen (0.246%), and available phosphorus (10.94 mg/Kg soil) for A. Senegal. The soil organic matter (3.93%), total nitrogen (0.285%), available phosphorus (11.66 mg/Kg soil) were significantly higher than open grassland with soil organic matter (3.52%), total nitrogen (0.218%), available phosphorus (10.73 mg/Kg soil) for B. aegyptica. This was more pronounced in the top 15 cm of soil under A. senegal woody plant species and on the light and moderate grazing site. Therefore, this tree has a significant effect on soil fertility improvement in resource poor rangelands and as a result, it is important to retain scattered A. senegal and B. aegyptica plants in the lowlands of eastern Ethiopia.

N2  - Abstract: This study presents the assessment of bioaccumulation and reproductive health risk associated with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) exposure in carnivorous waterbird species. We investigated OCPs and PCBs exposure in muscle tissues of 4 species of carnivorous waterbird species from Lake Ziway, Ethiopia. The influences of trophic position and size on accumulation of organochlorine pollutants are investigated. The result shows that Dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethanes (DDTs), Endosulfan and PCBs are detected. DDTs constitute the dominant contaminant among OCPs investigated. Trophic position and wing chord length are positively associated with levels of ∑DDTs. Mean levels of ∑DDTs and ∑PCBs vary from 143.9 to 1051.1 ng g−1 wet weight (ww) and not detected (ND)—3.5 ng g−1 ww, respectively. Mean levels of 4,4′-dichloro-diphenyl-dichloro-ethylene (p,p′-DDE), and 4,4′-dichloro-diphenyl-dichloro-ethane (p,p′-DDD) are significantly varied among the bird species. p,p′-DDE contribute 92.3–98.6% of total DDTs. About 26.7% of birds show p,p′-DDE levels above the minimum threshold to cause reproductive failures in birds. Generally, the findings of this study shows that DDT exposure in high trophic levels bird species from Lake Ziway could result in reproductive health risk. The present study may serve as a baseline for future comprehensive exposure and risk assessment studies.

N2  - Vegetable production is an important economic activity and a major source of vitamins, minerals, and income in Ethiopia. However, the production of vegetables is much less developed than the production of food grains in the country. Vegetable production still needs improvement in combating biotic and abiotic threats with innovative technologies. Nowadays, excess use of chemical fertilizers to satisfy the increasing demand for food exerts deadly effects on soil microorganisms and contribute to the deterioration of soil fertility and an increase in atmospheric pollution. Several types of research are still going on to understand the diversity and importance of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and their role in the betterment of vegetable production. PGPR facilitate plant growth directly by either assisting in the acquisition of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and other essential nutrients) or regulation of the levels of hormones. Indirectly PGPR decrease the inhibitory effects of various pathogens on vegetable growth and development in the forms of biocontrol agents. Some of the notable PGPR capable of facilitating the growth of vegetables such as potato, tomato, pepper, onion belong to genera of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Azotobacter, Enterobacter, and Azospirillum. Hence, to optimize vegetable production with reduced input of mineral fertilizers and pesticides, the use of PGPR in vegetable cultivation is recommended. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].

N2  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production in the tropics is usually limited by damage due to Angular Leaf Spot (ALS) caused by Phaeoisariopsis grisola. Field experiments were conducted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 at Jimma, Ethiopia, to determine the amount of yield loss due to ALS and to investigate the relationship between ALS and bean yield. Different levels of disease severity were created on two common bean varieties (GLPX-92 andICA15541) using natural epidemics by spraying the fungicide benomyl at 7-14- 21 and 28-day intervals and by seed dressing. Generally, all fungicide sprays significantly reduced ALS severity and increased yield and seed weight but seed dressing did not affect significantly. The relative yield and seed weight losses to ALS ranged from 2 to 47 and 15 to 33%, respectively. Single-point regression models predicted that for each per cent increase in ALS severity, there was a seed yield loss of 18 to 124.5 kg ha -1 inGLPX and 12.9 to 103.9 kg ha 1 for ICA15541 and 100-seed weight loss per sample of 100 seeds of 10 to 13 g for GLPX-92 and 13 to 22 mg for ICA15541. The study suggests that fungicide sprays affect ALS epidemics and influence the amount of loss in yield attributable to ALS permitting the crop to reach physiological maturity without being under severe infection. Thus fungicide sprays can be used as a means to reduce ALS severity and increase common bean yield. © 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

N2  - An ethnobotanical study was conducted in East Hararghe, Ethiopia to identify and investigate the use of various plants by the traditional healers and communities engaged in domestic, pesticide and medicinal use. A total of 78 species were observed to be used by the local inhabitants in the region for the treatments of various ailments. Out of these, herbs constitute 49% followed by trees (36%) and shrubs only 15%. However, most frequently used plant parts were leaf and aerial parts (20) followed by seed (13), fruit (12), other parts (10), rhizome (7) and bark (1). Most of the plants were found to be used for medicinal, aromatic and food flavouring (spices, condiments) purposes. Out of 78 species recorded in the present study, 11 were reported to cure stomachache, seven for cold, cough and respiratory problem, six for diarrhoea and five species were found capable of curing fever. Fabaceae was the largest family contributing to medicinal plant use with seven species followed by Solanaceae, Myrtaceae, (5 spp.), and Zingiberaceae, Asteraceae, Liliaceae (4 spp. each). Some of the important plants utilized for taking care of variety of ailments are Azadirachta indica, Brassica nigra, Balanites aegyptiaca, Maytenus ovatus, Rosmarinus officinalis and Trigonella foenum graecum. Most of these medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) play a significant role in the household economy and were observed to be very popular among the people. Unpopular plants were left out of the study. This study provides useful and basic information on usage of different plants for conducting further studies aimed at conservation and documentation of traditional medicine system and economic welfare of rural peoples of the East Hararghe, Ethiopia. It also revealed that indigenous practices contributed to sustainable management of plants.

N2  - Biological control of sugarcane smut (Ustilago scitaminea Syd.) using Trichoderma isolates is one of the untapped potentials in Ethiopian sugarcane plantations. To this end, this study was carried out with the objective to identify potential native Trichoderma isolates for the management of sugarcane smut. A total of 120 soil samples were collected from Kesem, Metehara, and Wonji sugarcane plantation fields. Consequently, 21 Trichoderma isolates were recovered from the samples, and in-vitro antagonist study of Trichoderma isolates against U. scitaminea was done using dual culture technique on fresh PDA. Among the native isolates, 12 of them revealed a pathogen suppression potential of >90% at 7 days after inoculation and most of them had higher pathogen suppression than the commercial isolate. However, five of the isolates were selected as potential candidates based on distinct suppression features, growth rate, and antagonistic performance. Identification of the five effective Trichoderma isolates (WI4-27, MKI2-k17, MI3-m33, WI12-25, and MKI3) was done based on macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Thus, the isolates were identified as T. harzianum, T. asperellum, T. viride, T. viride, and T. harzianum, respectively. Accordingly, these isolates could be used as one component of integrated smut management practices once a study on compatibility with fungicides, in-vivo efficacy test against smut, and substrate selection for mass production of the isolates were commenced.

N2  - Agricultural pesticides are important chemicals that are used to mitigate crop damage or loss and improve productivity. However, pesticides may cause negative environmental and human health effects depending on their specific distribution and use. Securing environmental safety and sustainability of pesticide distribution and use is widely seen as an important challenge for pesticide governance. This paper analyses how, why and under what circumstances Ethiopian pesticide supply chain actors deal with (un)safe distribution and use of pesticides and assesses their potential contribution to securing the quality, environmental safety and sustainability of pesticides importation, distribution and use. The framework developed for this is based on sustainable supply chain governance in order to assess the roles of and the interactions between the different chain actors, supporters and influencers. On the basis of field research in Ethiopia among key chain actors (importers, retailers, farmers) we analyse their involvement in three different environmental governance mechanisms: governing material flows of pesticides, managing information on health and environmental safety and providing training and capacity-building services. The study found the organisation of the pesticides supply chain in Ethiopia as atomistic. Environment and health hardly played a role in pesticides handling by the different supply chain actors, which was dominated by immediate profit motives. As a consequence smallholder farmers are put at risk because they are refrained from training, support or information provision on pesticides. Indeed, it was a failure of state governance that led importers and retailers to aggressive marketing and distributing pesticides unsafely and hinder the proliferate of private mode of governance. At the same time, a small signs of hope have also been identified at the supporters’ and influencers’ side of the chain. Successful environmental supply chain governance for safe pesticide distribution and use requires coordination and as well as training and information sharing (interaction) among pesticide supply chain actors, supporters and influencers at all levels-local, national and global as elements of one system of governance. Finally, the evidence presented in this paper suggests that due to limits in governmental capacity and concerns on commercial viability and on social and environmental impacts among private actors, there will be a role for private actors alongside public actors to ensure safe pesticide distribution and use. Public-private partnerships might constitute an attractive strategy for this aim.

N2  - Sasakawa Global 2000 (SG 2000), an international non-governmental organization (NGO) for assisting small-scale farmers in sub-Saharan African countries to increase staple food crop production, introduced conservation tillage (CT) technology to Ghana in 1993. In collaboration with the national Crop Research Institute (CRI) and a private company, SG 2000 has developed a 'no-till with mulch' cultivation system especially well suited to small-scale farmers. Farmers obtained 3-6 t/ha of maize compared with 1 t/ha by traditional methods. The CT technology package, together with herbicides and fertilizers, offers several advantages such as increased organic matter on the soil surface, soil erosion prevention and, in the long run, restoration of soil fertility. Farmers can reduce labor costs, save time and expand the size of the cultivated area at little cost. CT is profitable even when using inputs such as herbicides, improved seed and fertilizers. Widely adopted by a large number of small farmers in Ghana, the practice has been spreading to Mozambique, Ethiopia, Malawi and other countries where SG 2000 is in operation. By using CT technology, farmers do not need to plough the fields for seed bed preparation, and by applying a herbicide before planting, farmers are relieved from weeding, which is usually done manually. Weeds killed by the herbicide then dry up and become part of the mulch cover. This study proves that CT technology is a vital tool for promoting agricultural development in a sustainable manner. Examples of CT practice in selected SG 2000 country projects are discussed and the impact of CT on various aspects is elaborated. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Background: Greenhouse workers are exposed to organic dusts, and they are thereby at risk of developing airway disorders. This study aims to measure personal endotoxin exposure, assess respiratory symptoms and measure fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) among female flower farm workers in Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study involving female workers (n = 248) from four flower farms was conducted. The workers were interviewed for respiratory symptoms using a standard questionnaire. Workers from two of these farms also participated in personal endotoxin sampling (46 workers, 75 measurements) on glass fiber filters (0.2 μm pore size) inside conductive 25 mm Millipore cassettes for sampling of the "total dust" fraction. They also participated in FeNO (n = 114) measurements with a portable electrochemistry-based sensor. Chi-square and independent t-tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables respectively. A mixed-effects model was used to analyze exposure determinants. Results: Endotoxin exposure had a geometric mean (GM) of 22.8 endotoxin units (EU)/m3 with a maximum of 180 EU/m3. Greenhouse workers had significantly higher endotoxin exposure than workers outside the greenhouses (GM = 26.7 vs. 19.3 EU/m3 respectively; p < 0.05). The mean age of the workers was 24 years, and their mean working time in the flower farm was 21 months. Greenhouse workers had higher prevalence of self-reported respiratory symptoms than those outside greenhouses. However, after adjusting for education only blocked nose remained significant. The FeNO concentration ranged 5-166 ppb (GM = 14 ppb). Two workers had FeNO concentration above 50 ppb. FeNO levels differs significantly between the farms but there was no difference between workers inside and outside greenhouses. Conclusion: Greenhouse workers at flower farms had higher prevalence of blocked nose than workers outside, which may indicate the presence of rhinitis. Endotoxin exposure was low. There were few workers with objective signs of airway inflammation; this might be because the mean working time in the greenhouses was only two years. We suggest further studies to evaluate the effect of longer employment and exposure time as well as to investigate possible exposure to pesticides and other components in the bio-aerosols.

N2  - Background Mobile populations present unique challenges to malaria control and elimination efforts. Each year, a large number of individuals travel to northwest Amhara Region, Ethiopia to seek seasonal employment on large-scale farms. Agricultural areas typically report the heaviest malaria burden within Amhara thereby placing migrants at high risk of infection. Yet little is known about these seasonal migrants and their malaria-related risk factors. Methods and Findings In July 2013, a venue-based survey of 605 migrant laborers 18 years or older was conducted in two districts of North Gondar zone, Amhara. The study population was predominantly male (97.7%) and young (mean age 22.8 years). Plasmodium prevalence by rapid diagnostic test (RDT) was 12.0%; One quarter (28.3%) of individuals were anemic (hemoglobin <13 g/dl). Nearly all participants (95.6%) originated from within Amhara Region, with half (51.6%) coming from within North Gondar zone. Around half (51.2%) slept in temporary shelters, while 20.5% regularly slept outside. Only 11.9% of participants had access to a long lasting insecticidal net (LLIN). Reported net use the previous night was 8.8% overall but 74.6% among those with LLIN access. Nearly one-third (30.1%) reported having fever within the past two weeks, of whom 31.3% sought care. Cost and distance were the main reported barriers to seeking care. LLIN access (odds ratio [OR] = 0.30, P = 0.04) and malaria knowledge (OR = 0.50, P = 0.02) were significantly associated with reduced Plasmodium infection among migrants, with a similar but non-significant trend observed for reported net use the previous night (OR = 0.16, P = 0.14). onclusions High prevalence of malaria and anemia were observed among a young population that originated from relatively proximate areas. Low access to care and low IRS and LLIN coverage likely place migrant workers at significant risk of malaria in this area and their return home may facilitate parasite transport to other areas. Strategies specifically tailored to migrant farm workers are needed to support malaria control and elimination activities in Ethiopia. © 2015 Schicker et al.

N2  - Background There has been a noticeable increase in the prevalence of allergy-related disorders (ARDs) in the modern era. Urbanization is believed to be a major environmental risk factor for the onset of ARDs but data from low- to middle-income countries is limited. Objective Our purpose was to assess the prevalence of ARDs and atopy among a population of rural Ethiopian school children and identify environmental and lifestyle factors associated with such disorders. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study on 541 school-children. An interviewer-led questionnaire administered to the mothers of each participant provided information on demographic and lifestyle variables. Questions on allergic disease symptoms were based on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) core allergy and environmental questionnaire. Skin prick test for common allergens German cockroach (Blattella germanica) and dust mite (Dermatophagoides) was performed to define atopy. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the odds ratio between ARDs and atopy with specific environmental and lifestyle habits. Results 541 children responded to the survey questions: the majority of participants were female (60.3%) and aged 10±15 years-old. The prevalence of any ARD was 27%, while the rates of ever-having eczema, rhinitis, and wheeze was found to be 16.8%, 9.6%, and 8.6% respectively. Only 3.6% (19 school-children) tested positive for any skin sensitization. Analysis of associated factors for ARDs found that a family history of allergic disorders (AOR: 2.80; pvalue< 0.01), use of insecticides (AOR: 2.05; p-value<0.01), and wearing open-toed shoes (AOR: 2.19; p-value = 0.02) were all significantly associated factors. Insecticide use, riverbathing, and infection with intestinal parasites were found to be significantly associated factors for atopy. Other potential risk factors such as frequent use of soap, bacterial infection, and household crowding had no statistical significance. Conclusion Our study suggests that the prevalence of skin sensitization and ARDs in rural populations of developing countries is still relatively low. We identified several possible risk factors for further investigation. Overall, the significance of identified risk factors appears to indicate that genetic predisposition and exposure to environmental pollution are more important to the etiology of ARDs and atopy than specific lifestyle behaviors.

N2  - Cotton crop Ethiopia is a high-value crop and the strategy for pest control is insecticide-dependent with no consideration of beneficial insects. We carried out a study in 2013 and 2014 to determine the effectiveness of a food spray product developed with local ingredients from Benin (BFP), a food spray product developed from Ethiopian ingredients (EFP), and mixtures of the individual food spray products with and without neem extracts. Applications of BFP and of EFP alone attracted and retained beneficial insects and significantly reduced the number of pests, and increased cotton yields and profitability. The net margins of 18,418 and 18,642 Ethiopian birr (ETB)/ha were achieved from the plots treated with BFP and EFP, respectively, and 13,000 ETB (US$1 = 19 ETB) was achieved from the unsprayed plots. Addition of neem extract to the food spray products decreased the number of beneficial insects attracted to the food spray plots. In conclusion, food sprays can be used as part of integrated pest management (IPM) for managing cotton pests and can result in significant increases in crop yields and profitability.

N2  - Introduction As part of a field trial (PACTR201411000882128) to provide evidence on the combined use of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spray for malaria prevention, we measured haemoglobin values among children aged 6 to 59 months. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of anaemia, and to determine the risk factors of anaemia and change in haemoglobin value in Adami Tullu district in south-central Ethiopia. Methods Repeated cross-sectional surveys among 2984 children in 2014 and 3128 children in 2015; and a cohort study (malaria as exposure and anaemia as outcome variable) were conducted. The study area faced severe drought and food shortages in 2015. Anaemia was diagnosed using HemoCue Hb 301, and children with haemoglobin <11 g/dl were classified as anaemic. Multilevel and Cox regression models were applied to assess predictors of anaemia. Results The prevalence of anaemia was 28.2% [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 26.6±29.8] in 2014 and increased to 36.8% (95% CI, 35.1±38.5) in 2015 (P<0.001). The incidence of anaemia was 30; (95% CI, 28±32) cases per 100 children years of observation. The risk of anaemia was high (adjusted Hazard Ratio = 10) among children with malaria. Children from poor families [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR); 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1±1.6)], stunted children (AOR 1.5; 95% CI; 1.2±1.8), and children aged less than 36 months (AOR; 2.0; 95% CI, 1.6±2.4) were at risk of anaemia compared to their counterparts. There was no significant difference in risk of anaemia among the trial arms. Conclusions Young age, stunting, malaria and poverty were the main predictors of anaemia. An increase in the prevalence of anaemia was observed over a year, despite malaria prevention effort, which could be related to the drought and food shortage. Therefore, conducting trials in settings prone to drought and famine may bring unexpected challenges. © 2017 Haniffa et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

N2  - Tomato wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum, is a significant agricultural problem, leading to substantial yield losses. Although chemical fungicides are used to eliminate the severity of the disease, their continuous use poses a negative effect on the environment health. Therefore, bio-fungicides are frequently employed due to their eco-friendly properties and cost-effectiveness. This study focused on evaluating the antifungal properties of crude extracts derived from the leaves and bark of the guava plant (Psidium guajava) against Fusarium oxysporum. The leaves and bark of the experimental plant were collected from Gubrye and around Wabe river. The collected plant parts were brought into the laboratory and water rinsed properly, dried under shade, and milled to powder. The bioactive components were extracted from the powder using ethanol. The antifungal activities of the extracts against tomato wilt disease (Fusarium oxysporum) were estimated by using the Potato Dextrose agar (PDA) Agar well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the leaf and bark extracts of P. guajava was determined using the agar diffusion method. The standard antifungal drug, amphotericin (10 mg) was used as positive control whereas distilled water was used as negative control. The bioassay examination of the crude extracts was conducted at four different concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg/ml). In the current study, the presence of phytochemicals such as alkaloids, phlobatannins, saponins, tannins, and terpenoids in P. guajava leaves and the bark were confirmed and flavonoids were only found in the leaf extract. The effect of guava plant leaf and bark ethanol crude extracts of P. guajava was determined and significant antifungal activities against F. oxysporum in a concentration-dependent manner was observed. The ethanol crude extracts of leaf and bark had a high growth inhibitory effect at a concentration of 200 mg/ml with zones of inhibition of 9.5± 0.33 mm and 7.98± 0.08 mm respectively. The positive control amphotericin at 10 mg/ml concentration exhibits fungal growth inhibition by a mean zone of inhibition of 12.62 ± 0.14 mm. The P. guava leaf and bark crude extracts of ethanol showed the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 1.25 and 2.5 mg/ml respectively. The results of this study indicate that ethanol extracts of P. guajava leaves and bark exhibit promising antifungal activities against F. oxysporum. Therefore, these findings suggest that ethanol extracts of P. guajava leaves and bark could be considered as an alternative strategy for the management of potato wild disease. Highlights Guava (Psidium guajava) plant are known for their medicinal application Fungal disease leads to great destruction that final leads to substantial yield losses in agricultural horticultures and crops Biological based disease prevention is always safe alternative to environmental healthy Ethiopia is believed to be home for about 6500 species of higher plants © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Plant Research 2024.

N2  - Louse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is an epidemic disease with a fascinating history from Hippocrates’ times, through the 6th century ‘Yellow Plague’, to epidemics in Ireland, Scotland and England in the 19th century and two large Afro-Middle Eastern pandemics in the 20th century. An endemic focus persists in Ethiopia and adjacent territories in the Horn of Africa. Since 2015, awareness of LBRF in Europe, as a re-emerging disease, has been increased dramatically by the discovery of this infection in dozens of refugees arriving from Africa. The causative spirochaete, Borrelia recurrentis, has a genome so similar to B. duttonii and B. crocidurae (causes of East and West African tick-borne relapsing fever), that they are now regarded as merely ecotypes of a single genomospecies. Transmission is confined to the human body louse Pediculus humanus corporis, and, perhaps, the head louse P. humanus capitis, although the latter has not been proved. Infection is by inoculation of louse coelomic fluid or faeces by scratching. Nosocomial infections are possible from contamination by infected blood. Between blood meals, body lice live in clothing until the host’s body temperature rises or falls, when they seek a new abode. The most distinctive feature of LBRF, the relapse phenomenon, is attributable to antigenic variation of borrelial outer-membrane lipoprotein. High fever, rigors, headache, pain and prostration start abruptly, 2–18 days after infection. Petechial rash, epistaxis, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly and liver dysfunction are common. Severe features include hyperpyrexia, shock, myocarditis causing acute pulmonary oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, cerebral or gastrointestinal bleeding, ruptured spleen, hepatic failure, Jarisch–Herxheimer reactions (J-HR) and opportunistic typhoid or other complicating bacterial infections. Pregnant women are at high risk of aborting and perinatal mortality is high. Rapid diagnosis is by microscopy of blood films, but polymerase chain reaction is used increasingly for species diagnosis. Severe falciparum malaria and leptospirosis are urgent differential diagnoses in residents and travellers from appropriate geographical regions. High untreated case-fatality, exceeding 40% in some historic epidemics, can be reduced to less than 5% by antibiotic treatment, but elimination of spirochaetaemia is often accompanied by a severe J-HR. Epidemics are controlled by sterilising clothing to eliminate lice, using pediculicides and by improving personal hygiene. © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - In most developing countries, including Ethiopia, the excessive use of toxic and persistent pesticides for agricultural and malaria control purposes poses a significant challenge. This study focuses on evaluating the concentration and ecological risks associated with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in the sediments of Lake Tana and Hayqe. Employing a laboratory-based cross-sectional approach, the residues of OCPs in sediment samples were extracted using the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) method, followed by dispersive solid phase extraction cleanup (d-SPE) techniques and analyzed for 18 OCPs by gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The risk Quotient (RQ) method was adopted for ecological risk assessments by using fish, daphnia, and algae as indicators. The concentration of OCPs ranged from 10.11 to 125.65 μg/kg and 10.96–45.17 μg/kg in Lake Tana and Hayqe, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean concentration of OCPs across the sampling sites in Lake Tana. Deltamethrin and lindane exhibit comparatively lower concentrations among the OCPs, whereas endrin, DDT, and their metabolites were the predominant pesticides in the study area, exceeding WHO and USEPA residue limits, except for endosulfan. Risk Quotient values ranged from 0.006 to 865.4 in Lake Tana and 0.005 to 729.9 in Lake Hayqe, indicating potential low to high ecological risks for aquatic organisms. High ecological risks are particularly evident in fish, daphnia, and algae species exposed to α and β-Endosulfan, DDT, and their metabolites, while specifically in daphnia, endrin poses high ecological risks. The ANOVA test revealed there were statistically significant differences (p-value <0.05) among sampling sites in Lake Tana and the mean values between Lake Tana and Lake Hayqe, underscoring the importance of addressing pesticide-related ecological concerns in the region. © 2024 The Authors

N2  - Mycotoxins are toxic metabolites produced by certain fungal species that affect animal and human health. Data on the relationships between specific traditional storage management practices of sorghum and mycotoxin contamination are rarely available in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to investigate current sorghum storage management practices in major sorghum producer locations in Northwest Ethiopia and their relationships with mycotoxin contamination. Sorghum storage management practices of 120 farmers were surveyed, the occurrence of multiple mycotoxins in samples from their stored sorghum was determined, and potential relationships between the traditional storage management practices and mycotoxin contamination were analyzed. Samples were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS for 33 different mycotoxins. About 88% of the samples were contaminated with at least one mycotoxin. The detected mycotoxins belong to one of the four mycotoxin categories, produced by Aspergillus spp, Fusarium spp, Penicillium spp, and Alternaria spp. From the total, 3%, 7%, and 3% of the samples were contaminated with aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and zearalenone, respectively, above the EU regulatory limits. The measured concentrations that bypassed EU regulatory limits were 9.14, 18.34 and 29.13 (μg/kg) for total aflatoxins, 5.31, 12.50, 14.94, 15.77, 32.94, 56.81, 58.07 and 112.59 (μg/kg) for Ochratoxin A, and 123.48, 238.43 and 431.78 (μg/kg) for Zearalenone, respectively. Logistic regression showed relationships between the traditional storage management practices with mycotoxin contamination. The age and the experience of the Main Person Responsible for Storage management (MPRS), the placement of the storage structure, and the insecticide application showed negative relationships with multi-mycotoxin contamination. On the other hand, the educational status of the MPRS and the type of storage structure showed positive relationships with mycotoxin contamination. Therefore, it is recommended that farmers receive training in proper sorghum storage management to further reduce the mycotoxin contamination in the grain. © 2025 The Authors

N2  - This research examines the causal effect of adopting large-scale irrigation (LSI) technology on agriculture in Ethiopia using data from 450 farmers. Of the total sample, 254 farmers have adopted the LSI technology while the rest 196 are non-adopters who serve as control groups. Based on the findings from propensity score matching, sensitivity analysis and robustness checks, it is evident that embracing LSI technology has a significant positive impact on crop revenue, crop productivity, accumulation of farming assets as well as uptake of other technologies such as chemical fertilizers, improved seeds and agrochemicals. Specifically, the findings revealed that, due to the adoption of LSI technology, technology adopters earned 33,639 Ethiopian Birr (1247.81 United States Dollar (USD)) and 79,258 Ethiopian Birr (2940.01 USD) more in crop revenue and crop revenue per hectare of land, respectively. Additionally, LSI technology adopters possessed over six farming assets and adopted and used at least one more technology as compared to the nonadopters. These results are statistically significant at the 1 percent significance level. Although the study primarily centers on the North Mecha district of Ethiopia, its outcomes potentially hold significance for smallholder farmers across various regions of Ethiopia and other African countries with similar agricultural contexts. © 2025

N2  - The Omo River flows through the town of Omorate, where domestic, municipal, and industrial wastes from the town and its surroundings, including agrochemicals, are discharged into the river. The present study was conducted to determine the levels of heavy metals and associated environmental and human health impacts from the Lower Omo River freshwater ecosystem (water and sediment) of the Lower Omo River. The mean concentrations of heavy metals detected in the river water were 0.439 mg/l for (Mn), 0.1 (Zn), 0.168 (Cu), 0.393 (Cr), 0.318 (Pb), 0.007 (Ni), 8.926 (Fe), and 0.06 (Co).The order for the mean concentrations of the heavy metals in the water was Fe > Mn > Cr > Pb > Cu > Zn > Cu > Co > Ni. The HPI value indicates that all water sampling sites were highly contaminated. Oral and dermal HQs for both children and adults were in the order of Cr > Pb > Mn > Fe > Cu > Co > Ni > Zn. The HQ value greater than 1 was investigated for Cr, Pb, and Mn in both children and adults by ingestion and dermal routes from the river water. The CRs for both children and adults by ingestion of the river water followed the order Cr > Pb. According to the CRI value, the river water could be classified as a very high environmental risk. The EI results for the heavy metals detected in the sediments also followed the order: Fe > Cr > Cu > Pb > Mn > Co > Zn > Ni. © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Background: Evaluations of large-scale health and nutrition programmes in developing countries are needed for determining the effectiveness of interventions. This article critically analyses a non-governmental organization (NGO)-led large-scale, multi-country, 10-year micronutrient and health (MICAH) programme with an 'adequacy evaluation', that is, a documentation of time trends in the expected direction. Methods: MICAH was implemented from 1996 to 2005 in selected areas of Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania, reaching>6 million people with numerous health and nutrition interventions. Coverage and impact were monitored through surveys at baseline, midpoint and end of funding. The data were subjected to post-hoc methods of quality determination, and, if of suitable quality, included in the adequacy evaluation. Results: Most collected data were of moderate or high quality and therefore included in the adequacy evaluation. There were moderate to large improvements in vitamin A status in Ethiopian school-age children, children <5 years of age in Tanzania and Ghana and mothers in Ghana. Iodine status improved in Malawi and Tanzania. Anaemia rates and malaria prevalence decreased in women, pregnant women and pre-school children in Ghana, Malawi and Tanzania, but anaemia increased in Ethiopian women. Large increases were reported for rates of exclusive breastfeeding and immunization. Child growth improved to the maximum that would be predicted with the given interventions. Conclusions: Numerous nutrition and health impacts were observed in the intervention areas, often of a magnitude equal to or larger than observed in controlled interventions or trials. These results show the value of integrated long-term interventions. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Epidemiological Association.

N2  - We assessed potential effects of local meteorological and environmental conditions, indoor residual spraying with insecticides, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) use at individual and community levels, and individual factors on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence in a village in south Ethiopia. A cohort of 8,121 people was followed for 101 weeks with active and passive surveillance. Among 317 microscopically confirmed P. falciparum malaria episodes, 29.3% occurred among temporary residents. The incidence density was 3.6/10,000 person-weeks of observation. We observed higher malaria incidence among males, children 5-14 years of age, ITNs non-users, the poor, and people who lived closer to vector breeding places. Rainfall increased and indoor residual spraying with Deltamethrin reduced falciparum incidence. Although ITNs prevented falciparum malaria for the users, we did not find that free mass ITNs distribution reduced falciparum malaria on a village level.

N2  - Background: Malaria remains one of the major public health concerns in Ethiopia. Use of long- lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is the country's key malaria prevention and control strategy. This study intended to determine access to and usage gap of LLINs in malaria endemic settings in Southwestern Ethiopia. Methods: Data were collected from 798 households in three districts (Mana, Kersa and Goma) of Jimma Zone, Southwestern Ethiopia, from December 2013 to January 2014. The data were analyzed using SPSS software package version 17.0. LLINs ownership, access and utilization gap were determined following the procedure developed by Survey and Indicator Task Force of the Roll Back Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group. To complement the quantitative data, focus group discussions and interviews were conducted with community groups and key informants. Results: In this study, 70.9 % (95 % CI: 67.8-74.1 %) of the surveyed households had at least one LLIN, and 63.0 % (95 % CI: 59.6-66.3 %) had sufficient LLINs for every member of the household. With respect to access, 51.9 % (95 % CI: 50.5-53.5 %) of the population had access to LLIN. Only, 38.4 % (95 % CI: 36.9-39.9 %) had slept under LLIN the previous night with females and children having priority to sleep under LLIN. This gave an overall use to access ratio of 70.2 % which resulted in behavior-driven failure of 29.8 %. Of the households with sufficient LLIN access, females (AOR = 1.52; 95 % CI:1.25-1.83; P = 0.001) and children aged 0-4 years (AOR = 2.28; 95 % CI:1.47-3.53;P = 0.001) were more likely to use LLINs than other household members. Shape of nets, sleeping arrangements, low risk perception, saving nets for future use, awareness and negligence, and perception of low efficacy of the LLINs contributed to behavioral failures. Conclusions: LLIN use was hampered by lack of ownership and most importantly by behavioral driven gaps. This calls for designing and implementing appropriate behavioral change communication strategies to address behavioral failure. Improving access to LLINs also needs attention. Further, it requires moving beyond the traditional messaging approach for evidence based intervention to address specific needs and gaps. © 2015 Birhanu et al.

N2  - Multi-mycotoxin exposure data are missing to guide risk assessment and legislation in Ethiopia. This study therefore aimed to determine mycotoxin contamination levels in maize samples from 176 randomly selected household storages in three agro ecological zones of South (Sidama zone) and West (Jimma zone) Ethiopia, and to examine the postharvest practices and household processing. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify 23 mycotoxins. The majority of the households regularly consumed maize (more than once per day). More (77%) samples in Sidama were contaminated with Fusarium mycotoxins deoxynivalenol than in Jimma (29%) (P<0.001); Similar distributions of fumonisin B1 (19%), fumonisin B2 (19%) and fumonisin B3 (12%, Sidama vs 13%, Jimma) contamination were observed (P>0.05). In Sidama, only one sample was contaminated with the Aspergillus mycotoxin aflatoxin B2 and another sample with aflatoxin B1. From all samples, 40% were contaminated with 3-5 types of Fusarium mycotoxins and only 4% of the samples were contaminated with 6-8 types of mycotoxins. After the harvested maize was dried on the field, the majority of respondents in Jimma reported that they removed the maize within one day, which was less practiced in Sidama. The majority of households in Sidama, and some in Jimma, reported that they dried maize before storage, mainly using the sun. Close to two third of the study participants in the two zones reported that they applied the chemical dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) during maize storage. All households in both zones reported that they sorted visible mouldy maize grains before preparation of maize flour while most of them kept the mouldy maize for animal feed. Protective strategies of Fusarium mycotoxin contamination, with special focus on deoxynivalenol and zearalenone, should be well promoted in the study areas as they are possible human and animal health threats. © 2021 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

N2  - Tomato is one of the most widely produced vegetables in Ethiopia. Year-round production, mono-cropping, and genetically uniform hybrid varieties in relatively large areas result in pest buildup and recurrent pest epidemics in the country. Chemical control remains the primary management option for controlling tomato pests, and frequently indiscriminate and injudicious use of pesticides leads to several problem such as resistance development in insects/pathogens, destruction of natural enemies, food safety risks due to pesticide residues on the edible products and destruction of pollinators resulting in the non-setting of fruits and low yields. Multi-location and multi-season trials were conducted at Rift-Valley tomato production sites to reduce synthetic pesticides and promote good agricultural practice (GAP) packages. GAP package composed of healthy seedlings produced using seedling trays and treated with Trichoderma asperellum, and scheduled spray of bio-pesticides such as Beauveria bassiana, Lecanicillium lecanii, Metarhizium anisopliae, and neem extract depending on the insect pests at early infestation time, along with the installation of colored sticky traps (yellow and blue) significantly reduced Phthorimaea (Tuta) absoluta and increased marketable yield compared to the farmers’ practice and untreated control. Hence, the GAP package can be considered effective and economical in managing tomato pests. © 2024 World Vegetable Center. Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Background Neural tube defects (NTDs) are complex multifactorial disorders in the neurulation of the brain and spinal cord that develop in humans between 21 and 28 days of conception. Neonates with NTDs may experience morbidity and mortality, with severe social and economic consequences. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the pooled prevalence and determinants for neural tube defects among newborns in Ethiopia. Methods The protocol of this study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO Number: CRD42023407095). We systematically searched the databases PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and Research Gate. Grey literature was searched on Google. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 test statistic and the Cochran Q test statistic. A random effects model was used to estimate the birth prevalence of neural tube defects. Result Twenty-five articles were included in the meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence and determinants of neural tube defects in Ethiopia. A total of 611,354 newborns were included in the analysis. The pooled birth prevalence of neural tube defects was 83.40 (95% CI: 60.78, 106.02) per 10,000 births. The highest and lowest prevalence rates were 130.9 (95% CI: 113.52, 148.29) in Tigray and 28.60 (95% CI: 18.70, 38.50) per 10,000 births in Amhara regional states. Women’s intake of folic acid supplements and planned pregnancy were identified as protective factors for NTDs, while stillbirth history, use of any drugs during pregnancy, exposure to radiation, and pesticides during pregnancy were risk factors for neural tube defects. Conclusion The pooled birth prevalence of neural tube defects in Ethiopia was found to be high. Effective prevention interventions, especially focusing on periconceptional folic acid supplementation as well as folate fortification, should be prioritized alongside nutrition education, maternal health care, and environmental safety measures. © 2025 Gebremariam et al.

N2  - In this study, pesticide practices and related environmental and health effects were investigated in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia through a farmers’ survey. Questionnaires were distributed to 422 local farmers in the Arsi-Negele, Meki and Ziway areas. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the results of the questionnaire and to identify risk factors associated with environmental and health effects after spraying. The majority of the farmers (44.4–55.0%) stored their pesticides in the kitchen or anywhere in the house, while only 6.5–32.0% of the farmers stored them in a separate place outside the house. A large majority of the farmers (63%) did not use personal protective equipment during pesticide spraying and handling, which was negatively associated with understanding pesticide instructions of the pesticide labels, OR: 0.9; (95% CI:0.82–0.98) in the supervised stepwise backwards selection model. Reading the instructions of the pesticide labels was positively associated with understanding instructions OR: 1.59 (95% CI: 1.0–2.54). The risk for water pollution was higher in the Meki region OR: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.14–1.4) compared to Ziway and Arsi-Negele. Most farmers (66%) experienced discomfort after pesticide spraying and Illnesses from pesticide spraying were more frequently reported by educated farmers. Therefore, proper training in pesticide use in this region could strongly reduce the health risk associated with pesticide exposure. © 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - Objectives: This study aimed to assess malaria seroprevalence among acute febrile illness cases who come for health care seeking in the high malaria-endemic setting of North West Ethiopia. Methods: Institutional-based descriptive serosurvey of malaria infections was employed among 18,386 febrile patients from September 2020 to August 2021. Data were entered using Epi Data version 4.2 and exported to STATA (SE) R-14 version statistical software for further analysis. Bi-variable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to identify malaria infection. Finally, variables with P-value less than 0.05 were considered significant predictors for malaria infection. Results: The mean (±standard deviation) age of participants was 48.6 (±18.4) years. The overall seroprevalence of malaria infection was estimated as 27.8% (95% confidence interval = 27.2; 28.6, standard error = 0.003). Malaria infection was significantly associated with participants being female (adjusted odds ratio = 2.9; 95% confidence interval = 1.8; 3.7, P = 0.01), age 5–29 years (adjusted odds ratio = 2.2; 95% confidence interval = 1.7; 2.8, P = 0.02), rural (adjusted odds ratio = 3.9; 95% confidence interval = 1.9; 4.4, P = 0.001), and Hgb ⩽11 mg/dL (adjusted odds ratio = 3.4; 95% confidence interval = 1.9; 5.86, P = 0.01). Conclusion: Nearly every three to ten acute febrile cases were positive for confirmed malaria infection. The risk of malaria infection was significantly associated with respondents being female, aged 5–29 years, rural, and levels of hemoglobin were significantly associated with malaria infection. © The Author(s) 2022.

N2  - Background: The Government of Ethiopia and its partners have deployed artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) since 2004 and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) since 2005. Malaria interventions and trends in malaria cases and deaths were assessed at hospitals in malaria transmission areas during 2001-2011.; Methods: Regional LLINs distribution records were used to estimate the proportion of the population-at-risk protected by LLINs. Hospital records were reviewed to estimate ACT availability. Time-series analysis was applied to data from 41 hospitals in malaria risk areas to assess trends of malaria cases and deaths during pre-intervention (2001-2005) and postinterventions (2006-2011) periods.; Findings: The proportion of the population-at-risk potentially protected by LLINs increased to 51% in 2011. The proportion of facilities with ACTs in stock exceeded 87% during 2006-2011. Among all ages, confirmed malaria cases in 2011 declined by 66% (95% confidence interval [CI], 44-79%) and SPR by 37% (CI, 20%-51%) compared to the level predicted by preintervention trends. In children under 5 years of age, malaria admissions and deaths fell by 81% (CI, 47%-94%) and 73% (CI, 48%-86%) respectively. Optimal breakpoint of the trendlines occurred between January and June 2006, consistent with the timing of malaria interventions. Over the same period, non-malaria cases and deaths either increased or remained unchanged, the number of malaria diagnostic tests performed reflected the decline in malaria cases, and rainfall remained at levels supportive of malaria transmission.; Conclusions: Malaria cases and deaths in Ethiopian hospitals decreased substantially during 2006-2011 in conjunction with scale-up of malaria interventions. The decrease could not be accounted for by changes in hospital visits, malaria diagnostic testing or rainfall. However, given the history of variable malaria transmission in Ethiopia, more data would be required to exclude the possibility that the decrease is due to other factors.

N2  - Pheromone trap catches were used to study the spatial distribution of Diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella L., at both single field and regional levels. At the field level, the DBM population tended to remain within the cabbage field. At the regional level, DBM captures were highly influenced by geographic location and cropping systems. In highland areas, daily maximum temperatures positively influenced the aggregation index, whereas in the lowland areas, rainfall had a negative influence on the aggregation index. The implications for integrated DBM managements are as follows: at the local level, knowledge on spatial dynamics allows the delimitation of areas with high DBM infestations for consideration in both monitoring and biological control programmes. At the regional level, areas with year-round production of Brassica spp. and intensive use of pesticides should receive priority in the design and implementation of integrated DBM management systems.

N2  - Heavy weed infestation poses a major challenge to maize production in Ethiopia. Weed control is practised through hand-weeding or hoeing, both of which are neither adequate nor timely. This study attempts to develop an efficient and economical way of controlling weeds through the use of herbicides, and to evaluate the herbicides for toxicity to microorganisms, particularly plant-parasitic nematodes. Twelve treatments, in a randomised block design with three replications, were used. Sequential applications of atrazine (i.e. atrazine 2.0 kg/ha at pre-emergence followed by 0.25 kg/ha at post-emergence; atrazine 1.0 kg/ha at pre-emergence followed by 0.25 kg/ha at post-emergence) were found to significantly reduce the dry weights of monocots, dicots and total weeds. Pre-emergence applications of atrazine at 2.0 and 1.0 kg/ha, and of pendimethalin at 2.0 kg/ha, reduced dry weight only in dicot weeds. Sequential applications did not inhibit bacterial population growth, but were toxic to plant-parasitic nematodes and fungi, causing a reduction in their abundance. Sequential applications, and single application of atrazine 2.0 kg/ha at preemergence, resulted in maize yields, net benefits and benefit-cost ratios higher than other treatments. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - The research was carried out in neighboring weredas in Ethiopia (Raya Alamata in the Tigray region and Raya Kobo in Amhara) and assessed reasons for differences in the food security status of households in the two areas. The objective was to examine the relationship between disparities in social vulnerability and food security among households in the two woredas. Despite their close proximity, similar work cultures, natural resource availability, and land size, there is a significant difference in food security status and social vulnerability between Raya Alamata and Raya Kobo communities, with Raya Alamata reporting 84% food insecurity and Raya Kobo reporting 24%. Using propensity score matching (PSM), the study compared the degree of social vulnerability and food security of households, and the key variables linked to differences in food security between the communities of the two weredas were differences in irrigation systems, usage of agricultural inputs, extension packages, and other support systems. In contrast to Raya Kobo, where 68% of sample HHs use a groundwater irrigation system for agriculture, Raya Alamata woreda employs just 8.2% of such systems. Similar to this, in Raya Kobo, 51%, 49%, 31%, 27%, and 18% of the sampled HHs have appropriate access to better seeds, extension services, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, soil and water conservation measures, and manure. Only 0.9% of the surveyed HHs in Raya Alamata, however, receive improved seeds; 1.8% receive extension services; 1.8% receive chemical fertilizers; 0.9% receive compost or manure; 1.8% receive water and soil conservation programs. In addition to households’ access to irrigation, extension services, and agricultural inputs being much greater in Raya Kobo compared to Raya Alamata, the notable differences in the food security status of households in Raya Alamata and in Raya Kobo are due to the varying levels of social vulnerability in terms of access to basic social services and infrastructures, such as education, rural road facilities, potable water, and health. Differences in social vulnerability and food security between the Raya Alamata and Raya Kobo districts could not be explained by differences in farmland size and fertility. The key factors determining the food security of households are the availability of irrigation systems, the provision of agricultural inputs, and the availability of extension services. To ensure food security and significantly reduce poverty in the area, the study advises the provision of irrigation infrastructure, extension services, and agricultural inputs with strong market linkages.

N2  - Like other populations of developing countries, most of the populations of Ethiopia depend greatly on the use of traditional herbal medicines as the primary source of health care. However, these resources have been degraded throughout the country. Therefore, recording and documenting medicinal plants are essential for the future conservation of the species. Thus, the current study is related to this issue. Three hundred ninety-five informants participated in this study. The main data collection tools were semistructured interviews, discussions, and observation. The data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The quantitative methods (informant consensus factor, fidelity level) were used to analyze the level of homogeneity of the data, the agreements of informants, and the healing potential of medicinal plants. The ranking exercises (preference and direct matrix ranking) were used to quantify the most preferred and multipurpose medicinal plants. A statistical test was conducted using SPSS version 20 to test knowledge differences among the people. Following the analysis, 112 species of medicinal plants with 62 families were recorded. Most of the species were herbs, of which Fabaceae was the dominant family. Blood pressure and asthma were the most commonly reported human health problems. Most of the remedies were prepared from leaves, and most of them were prepared by pounding and were applied orally. Gastrointestinal diseases had the highest informant consensus. Five medicinal plants were recorded with the highest healing potential value for malaria, asthma, tapeworm, cough, and stomach ulcer. Verbascum sinaiticum Benth. was the most preferred medicinal plant in treating blood pressure. Trigonella foenum-graecum L. had the highest use value. The analysis results showed that local people showed significant knowledge differences (p<0.05). In conclusion, the indigenous people have a wealth of indigenous herbal knowledge. Therefore, to sustain the wealth of indigenous knowledge of the districts, immediate and well-designed conservation practices of medicinal plants should be conducted. © 2021 Derebe Alemneh.

N2  - Metal contamination of vegetables is a major concern, especially in areas where irrigation has been used for a long time. The Central Ethiopian Rift Valley Region is highly affected due to the heavy use of agrochemicals throughout the year. Although some studies have been conducted on the concentration and level of heavy metal pollution, little attention has been paid to their impact on human health. This study determined the concentrations of nine metals (As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in a soils and vegetables (tomatoes and onions) irrigated by Lake Ziway, Ethiopia. An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) was used to determine the heavy metal levels. Moreover, the study evaluated the health risks associated with consuming contaminated vegetables by employing major indices, including non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks. The results showed that the mean concentrations of Pb, As, Hg, and Cr in all tomato and onion samples and the average Zn, Pb, Cd, and Hg levels in all soil samples exceeded the FAO/WHO threshold. Non-carcinogenic health risk estimates showed that As, Pb, Hg, and Co for children and Pb and Co for adults had THQ values greater than 1, indicating the possibility of systemic health risks. Carcinogenic health risk showed that Ni posed a risk of developing cancer for both adults and children, with values ranging from 10−3 to 10−1. In addition, children are likely to have a higher cancer risk due to exposure to As and Cr. Therefore, it is crucial to raise awareness among stakeholders and implement effective monitoring policies to safeguard public health both within and beyond the study area. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Stingless bees are eusocial insects that play vital roles as pollinators of many flowering plants and high value products. However, information on their nesting habitats and nest characteristics is scarce in West Arsi Zone of Oromia, Ethiopia. This study was conducted to characterize indigenous knowledge, habitat, and nest of stingless bees. Data were collected using semistructured questionnaire, observations, and ground nest component measurement. The questionnaire survey was administered to 36 stingless bee honey hunters. The study result revealed that the stingless bee honey is considered important in treatment of cough and cold, asthma, tuberculosis, malaria, diabetes, and sore throat. Habitat loss and fragmentation, unwise use of agrochemicals, stingless bee enemies, destructive harvesting methods, lack of improved technologies for meliponiculture, and lack of government attention were the dominant threats to stingless bee hunting in the study area. Ground-nesting stingless bees' colonies are affected by several natural enemies, including ants, honey badgers, wasps, termites, snakes, and foxes. The eight nests of Meliponula beccarii (M. beccarii) were found under the ground at an average depth of 54.38 ± 17.25 cm in three different soil types. The nests of M. beccarii were protected with an average of 6.42 ± 2.82 guard bees/nest entrance that ranges from 2 to 9/colony. Moreover, the average value of honey volume per pot and per nest of M. beccarii was 20.38 ± 6.88 mL and 1.24 ± 427.28 L, respectively. The similarity of nesting substrates, nest architecture, and nesting environment with stingless bees in other regions and the unique indigenous knowledge of stingless bee honey hunters in the area aid in the direct adoption of stingless bee technologies to rescue the areas' ever-decreasing populations. Thus, based on these findings, adopting stingless bee colony domestication technology is critical for maintaining and improving productivity and conserving the species.  © 2024 Taye Beyene et al.

N2  - Agricultural intensification in sub-Saharan African countries has significantly increased pesticide applications. Information on pesticide residues and their transport in groundwater and streams is needed to properly manage and reduce any harm to the ecosystem and environment. This information is lacking in the volcanic soils of Ethiopian highlands. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess pesticide concentrations in ground and surface water and their risk to humans and aquatic life. The 9 km2 rural watershed Robit Bata in the Lake Tana Basin was selected. Crops were grown under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Pesticide use was assessed, and groundwater samples were collected from eight wells and surface water samples at the outlet twice in the rain phase and once in the dry phase. Samples were analyzed for chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, (α and β) endosulfan, profenofos, NO3−, and pH. Chlorpyrifos and endosulfan, which are strongly adsorbed and slowly degrading pesticides, were found in nearly all surface and groundwater samples, with maximum concentrations in surface water of 8 µg L−1 for chlorpyrifos and 3 µg L−1 endosulfan. Maximum groundwater concentrations were only slightly lower. The weakly adsorbed and fast degrading pesticides, dimethoate, and profenofos were detected only in the rain phase after spraying in the groundwater, indicating preferential transport to groundwater at depths of up to 9 m. The average concentration was 0.38 μg L−1 for dimethoate in surface waters and 1.24 μg L−1 in groundwater. Profenofos was not detected in surface water. In the groundwater, the average concentration was 0.05 μg L−1. Surface water concentrations of chlorpyrifos and endosulfan were highly toxic to fish. The World Health Organization banned these pesticides worldwide. It should be phased out for use in Ethiopia to safeguard the ecological health of Lake Tana, which is rich in biodiversity and endemic fish species.

N2  - Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused predominantly by Leishmania donovani and transmitted by both Phlebotomus orientalis and Phlebotomus martini, is highly endemic in East Africa where approximately 30 thousands VL cases are reported annually. The largest numbers of cases are found in Sudan - where Phlebotomus orientalis proliferate in Acacia forests especially on Sudan's eastern border with Ethiopia, followed by South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Uganda. Long-standing civil war and unrest is a dominant determinant of VL in East African countries. Here we attempt to identify the correlation between VL epidemics and civil unrest. Objective and methodology: In this review, literature published between 1955 and 2016 have been gathered from MSF, UNICEF, OCHA, UNHCR, PubMed and Google Scholar to analyse the correlation between conflict and human suffering from VL, which is especially apparent in South Sudan. Findings: Waves of forced migration as a consequence of civil wars between 1983 and 2005 have resulted in massive and lethal epidemics in southern Sudan. Following a comprehensive peace agreement, but especially with increased allocation of resources for disease treatment and prevention in 2011, cases of VL declined reaching the lowest levels after South Sudan declared independence. However, in the latest epidemic that began in 2014 after the onset of a civil war in South Sudan, more than 1.5 million displaced refugees have migrated internally to states highly endemic for VL, while 800,000 have fled to neighboring countries. Conclusion: We find a strong relationship between civil unrest and VL epidemics which tend to occur among immunologically naïve migrants entering VL-endemic areas and when Leishmania-infected individuals migrate to new areas and establish additional foci of disease. Further complicating factors in East Africa's VL epidemics include severe lack of access to diagnosis and treatment, HIV/AIDS co-infection, food insecurity and malnutrition. Moreover, cases of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) can serve as important reservoirs of anthroponotic Leishmania parasites.

N2  - Field trials were carried out at three locations in the cool-wet western and one location in the semiarid eastern ecozones of the Amhara State of Ethiopia to determine the effects of nitrogen fertilizer on pest infestation and yield losses caused by lepidopterous stemborers in maize and sorghum. Three N fertilizer levels, i.e. 60, 120 and 180 kg/ha for maize, and 41, 64, and 87 kg/ha for sorghum, were compared with a zero N treatment. The dominant pest species were the noctuid Busseola fusca (Fuller) and the invasive crambid Chilo partellus (Swinhoe). Leaf N content was positively related to N fertilizer dosage. In general, pest density, parasitism, plant growth and borer damage variables increased with crop growth stage. On sorghum, in the cool-wet western Amhara, increasing levels of N fertilizer also tended to increase pest density, plant growth and damage variables. In the semiarid ecozone, parasitism by the exotic parasitoid Cotesia flavipes Cameron tended to increase with N level. In the cool-wet ecozone, sorghum yields increased by up to 74% because of fertilization; losses caused by stemborers decreased linearly with N dosage from 49% to 36%. In maize, because of low borer densities, there were no discernable trends for pest infestation and yield losses. In the cool-wet ecozone, sorghum yields were positively related to insecticide application and plant height, and negatively to damage variables such as tunnelling and peduncle damage. In semiarid eastern Amhara, the effects of fertilizer on pest, damage and yield were low on both crops because of the higher soil fertility. The results indicate that the profitability of nitrogen fertilizer as an integrated pest management tactic in the control of cereal stemborers depends, among others, on the severity of borer damage and the soil fertility status prevailing in an area. It is concluded that N fertilizer helps minimize the impact of borers on grain yields, especially on sorghum and in the cool-wet ecozone. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.

N2  - Faba bean is the most vital legume crop in Ethiopia, but abiotic stresses primarily soil acidity are an obstacle for its production. Soil acidity disturbs and potentially limits nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. The interruption of nitrogen fixation and faba bean rhizobia interaction as a result of soil acidity leads to decreasing crop production. Sole dependence on chemical fertilizers for agricultural growth would mean further loss in soil quality and increased environmental damage. Rhizobial species show off sizable metabolic abilities to mitigate abiotic and biotic stresses, and mechanisms in stress tolerance are advancing fast, offering a strong foundation for the choice and engineering of rhizobia and legume hosts with better tolerance to soil acidity accordingly. The vast efforts to pick bioinoculants that can restore nitrogen under acid-affected soils are producing competitive crop yields. The main challenge of using single-type bioinoculant in field application can lead to variable and inconsistent outcomes. Co-inoculation of compatible microbes with organic farming which does not involve use of synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers is an imperative element in sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present chapter focuses on the field application of faba bean rhizobial inoculants in acidic soils as a promising potential input in organic farming system. Moreover, the mechanism of N2 fixation and plant growth promotion systems under severe salt, drought, acidity, temperature, and heavy metal stresses is also highlighted.

N2  - To evaluate the effective impact of Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) on berry loss in the smallholder context of SW Ethiopia, CBD symptoms were monitored during the rainy seasons of two consecutive years on both protected (with fungicide applications) and unprotected coffee branches. Fungicide applications (mancozeb) had significant effect (P < 4e-05) on the proportion of necrotic and dropped berries; CBD necrotic symptom was reduced from 48.7% (non treated) to zero (treated) while berry drop was reduced from 52.8% (non treated) to 40.8% (treated), suggesting that only 12.1% of the observed berry loss could certainly be attributed to CBD. Disease incidence was not influenced by the branch position in the canopy of the monitored trees. Altitude was an important factor controlling the disease incidence as it favored the development of both necrotic and drop symptoms. The result suggests that non-CBD factors controlling the physiology of berry production, such as plant age, pruning or soil fertilization, climate are predominant in the studied context to explain yield loss, and that berry drop symptom assessment alone may lead to an overestimation of CBD impact.

N2  - In Ethiopia institutional and extensive soil and water conservation (SWC) started in the 1970s. Due to several factors, most SWC works have not fully achieved the intended objectives. The disparity between dimensions of the implemented SWC work and the standard is the main factor. Therefore, this research work aimed to assess the design and constraints of SWC in the Gidabo sub-basin, of the Ethiopian rift valley. Data were generated through field observation, field measurements, household survey, interview, group discussion, and Arc GIS. According to the result, about 47.3% of the physical design of the implemented SWC structures failed to meet the standard dimension. In addition, the SWC lacks the standard supportive activities, such as the cut of the drain, check dam, biological work, and frequent maintenance. FGD and KII showed about 71.3% of the farmers accepted SWC technologies, but they have constraints for SWC. These were small land size, food insecurity, lack of resources, technical skill, field guidance, poor maintenance, as well as young migration. The researchers used the chi-square test for the significant variation of constraints along with different agro ecology. According to the chi-square result, significant association was observed between land size, access to fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, construction materials, technical skill, and maintenance of the structures versus agro ecology. Therefore, the implementation of SWC practices should be focused on the way to avoid/lower the observed mismatch of the structures against the standard. Also the constraints in different agro ecology should be solved through full community participation in order to follow the standard SWC measures for sustainable socio-economic and environmental development.

N2  - Finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn) is a highly nutritious crop, predominantly grown in the semi-arid tropics of the world. Finger millet has a niche market opportunity due to its human health benefits and being rich in calcium, iron and dietary fiber and gluten-free. Ethiopia is the center of the genetic diversity of the crop. However, the productivity of finger millet in the country is low (<2.4 tons ha−1 ) compared with its potential yield (6 tons ha−1 ). The yield gap in Ethiopia is due to a range of biotic and abiotic stresses and socio-economic constraints that are yet to be systemically documented and prioritized to guide future production and improved variety development and release. The objective of this study was to document finger millet production opportunities, constraints and farmer-preferred traits in Ethiopia as a guide to variety design in improvement programs. A participatory rural appraisal (PRA) study was undertaken in six selected districts of the Southern Nation Nationalities People Region (SNNPR) and Oromia Region in Ethiopia. Data were collected from 240 and 180 participant farmers through a semi-structured questionnaire and focus group discussion, respectively. Finger millet was the most important crop in the study areas grown mainly for a combination of uses, including for food, feed and cash (reported by 38.8% of respondent farmers), food and feed (14.5%), food and cash (13.7%), food (11.5%) and food, cash, feed and construction material (9.7%). Hand weeding was used by 59.2% of the respondent farmers, followed by hand weeding and chemical herbicides (40.8%). Finger millet was mainly planted as a sole crop (reported by 97.0% respondents), mixed (1.7%) and sole and mixed (1.3%). About 75.6% of respondent farmers only practiced finger millet rotation with other crops. Respondent farmers indicated their source of fresh seed was from the Bureau of Agriculture (49.1%), farmer-to-farmer seed exchange (22.1%), own saved seed (7.5%), local producers (7.5%), research institutions (5.8%), unknown sources (4.1%), local market (3.5%) and cooperatives (0.42%). The total cost of finger millet production per hectare was calculated at 1249 USD with a total income of 2139 USD/ha, making a benefit to cost ratio of 1.71:1.00 and indicating the relatively low yield gains using the currently grown varieties. The main constraints to finger millet production in the study areas were drought stress (reported by 41.3% respondents), lack of improved varieties (12.9%), lack of financial resources (11.3%), small land holdings (10.8%), limited access to seed (10.0%), a shortage of fertilizers (5.4%), poor soil fertility (4.6%), shortage of draught power (1.3%), labour shortages (1.3%) and high labour costs (1.3%). The most important farmer-preferred traits in a finger millet variety were high grain yield, compact head shape, ‘enjera’-making quality, high marketability and early maturity, resolved through principal component analysis. The above-mentioned production constraints and farmer-preferred traits are strategic drivers to enhance finger millet productivity and need to be incorporated into Ethiopia’s finger millet breeding and technology development.

N2  - The study was conducted at Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research, Haramaya University and Jimma University, Ethiopia. Crop yield is directly associated with the physical and biological quality of planting material or seed. Ninety-nine (99) chickpea seed lot samples were collected for physical purity, seed health and germination tests from major chickpea growing areas in Ethiopia in the 2016/17 cropping season to assess the status of chickpea seed health and quality among subsistence farmers, research stations and seed growers. The seed lots were grouped as researcher saved, farmers saved and seed growers’ saved seed. The maximum physical purity of 97.5% was recorded for the researcher saved seed lots, 90.8% for the seed growers and 87.4 % for the farmers saved seeds. Foreign matters and broken seeds were the most contaminants found in the seed lots. The seed germination percentages were in the range of 96.3% to 98.5% for all seed sources and there were no significant differences among the seed lot samples. A total of seventeen (17) fungi species were isolated from all seed sources with different frequency and amount. These are Fusarium spp., Aspergillus sp., A. niger, A. flavus, A. nidulans, A. candidus, A. fumigatus, Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Verticillium sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Pythium sp., Alternaria sp., Helminthosporium sp. Phylostica sp., Cladosporium sp., Negrospora sp. Aspergillus flavus was found the most dominant with recovery (Relative Density=21.53%, Infection rate=10.36%, and Infection Frequency=25.59 %) from all seed lots. There were high variations in relative density, Infection rate, and Infection frequency among isolated fungi. Ascochyta rabiei the most important chickpea disease was not found in this study. This might relate to the incidence and prevalence of sample collection season/cropping year which was low in expected areas. The current study concluded that there are seed qualities and seed health management issues with regards to different seed sources (farmers, research and private sectors); this entails strong seed quality control and growers’ awareness creation on storage sanitation, seed health test before sowing, and production of healthy crops. To keep the seed health in a better condition, seed growers should keep a wider interval of rotation, develop use of the healthy improved seed, after some generation (4-5), seed grading to avoid loss of physical purity, use of appropriate storage container (ventilated and clean), seed dressing with safe pesticides, and appropriate moisture level for storage (about 14%) should have to keep. Longer storage also gives a chance to contaminate the whole seed and can expose to decay. © (2024) All Rights Reserved.

N2  - Background: The decline in wheat output in Ethiopia is widely attributed to pests, which has led to a rise in the usage of pesticides to boost productivity. The degree of pesticides sorption and degradation which influence the likelihood of environmental contamination from pesticides seeping into water bodies from soil has not yet been published for Ethiopian soils. The study aimed at to quantify the levels of pesticide residues, assess glyphosate’s adsorption capabilities and degradation rate in the soils. Materials and methods: QuEChERS method of extraction was employed to determine the concentration of the respective pesticides. The adsorption capacities of glyphosate in agricultural soils of Cheha and Dinsho districts were measured using batch adsorption techniques. Results: Six pesticide residues were found in 12 soil samples at varied quantities. Glyphosate (24.00-219.31 µg kg−1), s-metolachlor (23.67-220.67 µg kg−1), chlorpyrifos (27.74 202.67 µg kg−1), pyroxulam (14.67-50.65 µg kg−1), florasulam (78.00-250.67 µg kg−1), malathion (15.00-49.67 µg kg−1). The experimental results showed that glyphosate was slightly sorbed at SD10 soil (18.91 μg−1−n mLn g−1) in comparison to SC1 soil (114.66 μg−1−n mLn g−1). Organic matter and clay content proving to be the principal factors influencing the process. According to adsorption experimental data, chemisorption is the major process in glyphosate adsorption, with the pseudo-second order kinetic model providing the best fit (R2 =.99). The soils in the study area exhibit notable variations in glyphosate rate of degradation (0.0076-0.0221 week−1). The findings show that the main soil variables affecting the half-life (glyphosate degradation) were clay concentrations (R2 =.48; P =.013), pH (R2 =.55; P =.0055), Organic matter (R2 =.74; P =.00027), Feox (R2 =.50; P =.0105), and Alox (R2 =.73; P =.00046). Conclusion: The weak glyphosate adsorption capabilities of soils can be a good indicator that the pesticide residues in the soil are poised to endanger soil organisms and contaminate nearby water bodies through runoff and leaching. © The Author(s) 2025.

N2  - The Ethiopian agriculture sector, supporting over 85% of the population’s livelihood, has been severely impacted by armed conflict, disrupting nearly every element of its value chain. Key direct impacts of conflict include the destruction of essential assets like farmland, livestock, crops, seed reserves, and critical infrastructure. This study aims to evaluate the war’s effect on agricultural inputs, management practices, and services in selected districts within South Wollo, northeastern Ethiopia, and to propose viable mitigation strategies. Both primary and secondary data were gathered, with primary data collected through surveys, focus group discussions, and interviews with key informants. Quantitative data were analyzed using SAS software, while qualitative data were examined through descriptive and narrative methods. The conflict has damaged agricultural inputs, management practices, infrastructure, and services, including irrigation canals, farmer training centers, veterinary services, and nursery sites, significantly exacerbating food insecurity. Agrochemical supplies were impacted for 53% of respondents, while 66.5% reported disruption in livestock management practices. Total irrigation infrastructure and agricultural institution damage in South Wollo was estimated at 17,988.90 million Ethiopian birrs (ETB). Therefore, immediate actions for the restoration of damaged agricultural infrastructures, institutions, and services are necessary, along with reinstating agricultural inputs, capacity building and community engagement, monitoring and evaluation, and networking and partnerships. These recommendations should be tailored based on the local context, existing conditions, and available resources. Engaging with communities to understand their unique needs and preferences is essential in making these initiatives effective and sustainable. © 2024 Universidad de Concepcion. All rights reserved.

The crop is attacked by number of diseases caused by fungi, bacteria, virus, mycoplasma, nematodes etc. and causeshudge amount of crop loss across the world. Among the diseases, early blight also known as target spot disease incited by Alternariasolani (Ellis and Martin) Jones and Grout, is one of the world’s most catastrophic disease of tomato (Abada et al., 2008). The disease causes loss from 50 to 86 percent in fruit yield in different parts of the country. (Mathur and Shekhawat, 1986, Datar and Mayee, 1981). The pathogen survive for a long time in the diseased plant parts, soil and on alternative/ collateral hosts in the absence of main host, determine the wide ability of the pathogen to perpetuate (Moore and Thomas, 1942; Basu, 1971 and Rands, 1917a). The management of disease can be done through the cultural practices (Rashmi Tewariet al., 2012), biological control (Kokalis-Burelle, 2002), chemical measures (Nguyen Khanh et al., 2013, Sahu, et al., 2013.) and use of resistance variety (Biswas et al., 2015). Cultural practice like field sanitation, deep summer ploughing, soil solarisation, soil amendments and crop rotation etc. can minimize the possibility of disease but cannot completely control the disease in standing crops. Another alternative method of disease management strategy is biological control. In this context, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma viride, Chaetomiumglobosum, Gliocladiumvirens etc. have been exploited for management of diseases but biological control alone cannot manage the disease completely because of little fluctuation in temperature, pH, moisture, etc. largely affects the efficacy of bio-agent. The use of resistance variety is another important method which is reliable and cheep for management of plant disease but due to development of new races of pathogen, the resistance variety becomes susceptible one. Hence, the use of chemicals is the last and only method for plant disease management. It is also so effective in control of disease but man started using it indiscriminately. Excessive use of chemicals has caused soil, air, surface and ground water pollution besides effecting crop produce. The chemicals have entered our food chain also. Other detrimental effects of excessive use of chemicals are development of pesticide resistance strain in pathogen contamination of food by toxic residues, resurgenceof pest and detrimental effect on non target organism and also cost of production. Under these circumstances, a sound disease management strategy is the need of the day to provide long lasting protection in an ecofriendly manner to obtain eco-friendly safe and a sustainable agriculture. The successful integrated approach for management of diseases have found in tomatoagainst Fusarium wilt (Raviendra et al., 2015), in rice against brown leaf spot (Biswas et al., 2008, Kumawat, et al., 2010), in wheat against spot blotch (Umashanker, 2014).Therefore, the study was undertaken in the present investigation as sustainable integrated approach for management of early blight and their ABSTRACT Integrated approach on disease severity and growth parameter of tomato revealed that minimum disease severity with 8.56% was found in case of soil application of FYM + seedling treatment with bio formulation of T. harzianum + spray of Mancozebfollowed by soil application of FYM + seedling deep in Mancozeb + spray of Mancozeb (08.32%) against 95.50% in case of control. Soil application with FYM+ seedling treatment with bio formulation of T. harzianum + spray of Mancozeb also stimulate shoot length of tomato, representing the value15.36, 17.20, 22.46, 26.93 and 31.43 cm against 10.10, 12.06, 17.06, 21.46 and 26.40 cm in case of control at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 days age of plant commences after 10 days of trans planting.The fresh and dry shoot and root weight was also found maximum with 25.3 g & 7.27gm and 22.00gm & 4.25gm respectively in treatment T8where treatment was given as soil application of FYM + seedling deep in T. harzianum formulation + spray with mancozed.Width of root zone was maximum found in case of soil application of FYM + seedling treatment with bio formulation of T. harzianum + spray of Mancozeb with 22.66cm. Thus, the finding may be concluded thatsoil application of FYM + seedling treated with bio formulation of T. harzianum + spray of Mancozeb not only reduced disease severity but also stimulate plant growth parameters.

N2  - Pesticides coupled with other modern inputs undoubtedly have enabled the Indian farmers to achieve unparalleled increase in agricultural productivity over the last five decades. Evidences indicate that pests cause 25 per cent of the losses in paddy, 50 per cent in cotton, 30 per cent in pulses and 20 per cent in sugarcane (Dhaliwal and Arora, 1996). Until recently, chemical pesticides were increasingly relied upon to limit the production losses, but now there is a growing concern of the health hazards associated with pesticide usage. Environmental contamination from the use of pesticide ranges from water, air and soil pollution to alteration of the ecosystem resulting in detrimental effects to non-target organisms. Evidence of pesticide threats to human health and trade-off between health and economic effects have been documented in several studies in the past (Rola and Pingali, 1993; Antle and Pingali, 1994). Although, the pesticide consumption in India is low (0.57 kg/ha) as compared to countries like Japan (12 kg/ha), Taiwan (17 kg/ha) and West Germany (3 kg/ha), the pesticide residues in food especially vegetables in India are the highest in the world. This is mainly due to unregulated use of pesticides. India accounts for one-third of the total pesticide poisoning cases in the world (Puri, 1998). Experience have shown that such methods of plant protection have proven to be increasingly unsustainable and cost-ineffective due to development of pest resistance, rising pesticide costs, pesticide-induced outbreaks of pests and the negative effects of pesticide use on human health and the environment. The synthetic organic insecticides widely used in agriculture are general biocides having innate ability to cause injury to all living organisms as well as to the quality of environment. The presence of residues of these pesticides in food commodities and other components of the environment has proved toxic to human beings, domestic animals, birds, fish and other nontargeted fauna of the agro-ecosystem. Despite the fact that the consequences of injudicious use of pesticides in Asia are well documented, crop protection continues to be dominated by dependence on chemicals. The practice of calendar spraying is common among Asian farmers and pesticide subsidies main a major aspect of plant protection policies in many countries (Gopalan, 1998). Though negative externalities cannot be eliminated altogether, their intensity can be minimized through development, dissemination and promotion of environment friendly technologies such as bio-pesticides and bio-agents as well as better agro-economic practices commonly known as Integrated Pest Management (IPM) rather than solely relying on chemical pesticides.

N2  - Phytoremediation is an important process in the removal of heavy metals and contaminants from the soil and the environment. Plants can help clean many types of pollution, including metals, pesticides, explosives, and oil. Phytoremediation in phytoextraction is a major technique. In this process is the use of plants or algae to remove contaminants in the soil, sediment or water in the harvesting of plant biomass. Heavy metal is generally known set of elements with atomic mass (> 5 gcm -3), particularly metals such as exchange of cadmium, lead and mercury. Between different pollutant cadmium (Cd) is the most toxic and plant and animal heavy metals. Mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) are the plant for the production of high biomass and rapid growth, and it seems that the appropriate species for phytoextraction because it can compensate for the low accumulation of cadmium with a much higher biomass yield. To use chelators, such as acetic acid, ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and to increase the solubility of metals in the soil to facilitate easy availability indiscernible and the absorption of the plant from root leg in vascular plants. *Corresponding Author: Awais Shakoor  awais.shakoor22@gmail.com Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES) ISSN: 2220-6663 (Print) 2222-3045 (Online) Vol. 10, No. 3, p. 88-98, 2017 http://www.innspub.net J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 89 | Shakoor et al. Introduction Phytoremediation consists of Greek and words of "station" and Latin remedium plants, which means "rebalancing" describes the treatment of environmental problems treatment (biological) through the use of plants that mitigate the environmental problem without digging contaminated materials and disposed of elsewhere. Controlled by the plant interactions with groundwater and organic and inorganic contaminated materials in specific locations to achieve therapeutic targets molecules site application (Landmeyer, 2011). Phytoremediation is the use of green plants to remove contaminants from the environment or render them harmless. The technology that uses plants to" green space "of heavy metals in the soil through the roots. While vacuum cleaners and you should be able to withstand and survive high levels of heavy metals in the soil unique plants (Baker, 2000). The main result in increasing the population and more industrialization are caused water and soil contamination that is harmful for environment as well as human health. In the whole world, contamination in the soil by heavy metals has become a very serious issue. So, removal of these heavy metals from the soil is very necessary to protect the soil and human health. Both inorganic and organic contaminants, like petroleum, heavy metals, agricultural waste, pesticide and fertilizers are the main source that deteriorate the soil health (Chirakkara et al., 2016). Heavy metals have great role in biological system, so we can divide into two groups’ essentials and non essential. Those heavy metals which play a vital role in biochemical and physiological function in some living organisms are called essential heavy metals, like zinc (Zn), nickel (Ni) and cupper (Cu) (Cempel and Nikel, 2006). In some living organisms, heavy metals don’t play any role in biochemical as well as physiological functions are called non essential heavy metals, such as mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and Cadmium (Cd) (Dabonne et al., 2010). Cadmium (Cd) is consider as a non essential heavy metal that is more toxic at very low concentration as compare to other non essential heavy metals. It is toxic to plant, human and animal health. Cd causes serious diseases in human health through the food chain (Rafiq et al., 2014). So, removal of Cd from the soil is very important problem to overcome these issues (Neilson and Rajakaruna, 2015). Several methods are used to remove the Cd from the soil, such as physical, chemical and physiochemical to increase the soil pH (Liu et al., 2015). The main source of Cd contamination in the soil and environment is automobile emissions, batteries and commercial fertilizers (Liu et al., 2015). Phytoremediation is a promising technique that is used in removing the heavy metals form the soil (Ma et al., 2011). Plants update the heavy metals through the root and change the soil properties which are helpful in increasing the soil fertility (Mench et al., 2009). Plants can help clean many types of pollution, including metals, pesticides, explosives, and oil. Plants also help prevent wind and rain, groundwater and implementation of pollution off site to other areas. Phytoremediation works best in locations with low to moderate amounts of pollution. Plants absorb harmful chemicals from the soil when the roots take in water and nutrients from contaminated soils, streams and groundwater. Once inside the plant and chemicals can be stored in the roots, stems, or leaves. Change of less harmful chemicals within the plant. Or a change in the gases that are released into the air as a candidate plant Agency (US Environmental Protection, 2001). Phytoremediation is the direct use of living green plants and minutes to stabilize or reduce pollution in soil, sludge, sediment, surface water or groundwater bodies with low concentrations of pollutants a large clean space and shallow depths site offers favorable treatment plant (associated with US Environmental Protection Agency 0.2011) circumstances. Phytoremediation is the use of plants for the treatment of contaminated soil sites and sediments J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 90 | Shakoor et al. and water. It is best applied at sites of persistent organic pollution with shallow, nutrient, or metal. Phytoremediation is an emerging technology for contaminated sites is attractive because of its low cost and versatility (Schnoor, 1997). Contaminated soils on the site using the processing plants. Phytoremediation is a plant that excessive accumulation of metals in contaminated soils in growth (National Research Council, 1997). Phytoremediation to facilitate the concentration of pollutants in contaminated soil, water or air is composed, and plants able to contain, degrade or eliminate metals, pesticides, solvents, explosives, crude oil and its derivatives, and other contaminants in the media that contain them. Phytoremediation have several techniques and these techniques depend on different factors, like soil type, contaminant type, soil depth and level of ground water. Special operation situations and specific technology applied at the contaminated site (Hyman and Dupont 2001). Techniques of phytoremediation Different techniques are involved in phytoremediation, such as phytoextraction, phytostabilisation, phytotransformation, phytostimulation, phytovolatilization, and rhizofiltration. Phytoextraction Phytoextraction is also called phytoabsorption or phytoaccumulation, in this technique heavy metals are removed by up taking through root form the water and soil environment, and accumulated into the shoot part (Rafati et al., 2011). Phytostabilisation Phytostabilisation is also known as phytoimmobilization. In this technique different type of plants are used for stabilization the contaminants from the soil environment (Ali et al., 2013). By using this technique, the bioavailability and mobility of the different contaminants are reduced. So, this technique is help to avoiding their movement into food chain as well as into ground water (Erakhrumen, 2007). Nevertheless, Phytostabilisation is the technique by which movement of heavy metals can be stop but its not permanent solution to remove the contamination from the soil. Basically, phytostabilisation is the management approach for inactivating the potential of toxic heavy metals form the soil environment contaminants (Vangronsveld et al., 2009).

N2  - The increase of the world population and the need to elevate food production improved the agriculture used techniques. One of the most important change that happened in the form and in the mean of agricultural production was pesticides. These products are used to control of insects, diseases and weeds that damage the cultures development. However, the intense application of these in the agricultural areas has been causing the contamination and pollution of the soil, water and air. These resources are indispensable for the human and animal survival in the Planet. In the last decades an increase of the world concern was verified regarding the impact that certain practices cause to the environment among abusive use of pesticides. When applied in the cultures, the pesticides usually reach the soil and, depending on the edaphic and product characteristics and of the environmental conditions, these products could do the ecosystem contamination. In this review are approached to the contamination of the soil and superficial and underground waters for the current pesticides use in the agricultural systems, as well as practices and handling forms that help the environment preservation.

The sustainable agriculture involves optimizing agricultural resources and at the same time maintaining the quality of environment and sustaining natural resources. In achieving this optimization, the soil microbial community composition is of great importance, because they play a crucial role in carbon flow, nutrient cycling and litter decomposition, which in turn affect soil fertility and plant growth (Chauhan et al., 2006; Tripathi et al., 2006), and hence occupy a unique position in biological cycles in terrestrial habitat. The soil microbial biomass is considered as active nutrient pool to plants and plays an important role in nutrient cycling and decomposition in ecosystem (De-Lorenzo et al., 2001). Herbicides are applied to control weeds in the crop field have direct (or) indirect consequences on non-targeted organisms including soil microflora. After application of herbicides, microorganisms are able to degrade and utilize them as energy source for their metabolic activities and also for physiological processes. While processing these activities there may be a chance of change in soil physicochemical characteristics. Diversified effect of both toxic and as well as beneficial effect of herbicides on soil microorganisms and soil characteristics were studied in different ways in the recent past (Trimurtulu et al., 2015). The continuous use of environmentally persistent herbicides and other synthetic agricultural chemicals posed great risks to soil and water contamination. A viable alternative pesticide that is equally effective and less harmful to the environment is in demand (Souza et al., 2012). The persistence of a pesticide in the soil is defined as the period or extension of time in which it remains active. There is serious concern about the increased use of herbicides, which may cause (i) environmental hazards such as water table and water body contamination, (ii) biological disruption in crop field populations, and (iii) reduced efficiency as a result of increased population of soil microorganisms more efficient in herbicide degradation. The herbicide that are used frequently eventually reach the soil from the crop plants and accumulates in top 0-15 cm layer of soil, where the activities of microbes are found to be maximum. Herbicides in the soil affect the non-target and beneficial microorganisms and their activities which are essential for maintaining soil fertility (Sethi et al., 2015). Atrazine is a selective preand postemergence herbicide providing knockdown and residual action. It has low rate of volatilization from soil and is moderately persistent (half-life of ~60 days). It is more persistent in neutral and alkaline soils than in soils with low pH. It is moderately mobile and able to be leached through soils into groundwater (Kruger et al., 1996). Metolachlor is a selective herbicide used in the control of grassy weeds in the cultivation of corn, soybeans, peanuts, cotton and other crops. Metolachlor is often used in combination with other broadleaved herbicides (e.g. atrazine, metobromuron and propazine) to extend the spectrum of activity (Ayansina and Oso, 2006). Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum systemic herbicide. It is nonvolatile, it is strongly adsorbed by soil particles and is essentially immobile in soil (AATSE, 2002). Paraquat is a broad-spectrum herbicide that destroys plant tissue by contact action. It is highly soluble in water and because of its ionic properties is strongly adsorbed by soil particles and is essentially immobile in soil. The strong binding of paraquat to clay minerals is the factor most likely associated with its long half-life in soils (Clive, 2006). Fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and some other materials applied to soil often contribute to water and air pollution. Therefore, soil is a key component of environment chemical cycles. Dissolved mineral matter in soil is largely present as ions. Prominent among the cations are H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+ and usually very low levels of Fe2+, Mn2+ and Al3+. Multivalent cations and anions form ion pairs with each other in soil, solutions (Maynard, 2000). Hence this study determined the effect of selected herbicides (Atrazine, Xtravest, Gramoxone and Glyphosate) on exchangeable cations and also analysed the in-vitro biodegradation of this herbicides as well as assayed for their residual concentration in soils after treatment.

I agricultural practices that involve the use of agrochemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides have greatly increased the global food supply but often with detrimental effects on the environment, such as contamination of ground and surface water, air pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Thus, there is a need to give more attention to the sustainable agricultural systems that rely, as much as possible, on the use and effective management of internal resources (Bohlool et al., 1992). Cultivating N-fixing plants is a valuable approach to curbing the increasing reliance on chemical inputs. Introducing legumes into cereal-dominated cropping systems can provide many advantages, such as fixing great amounts of atmospheric N which will then be partly available to the subsequent crop; reducing the occurrence of pests and weeds; and improving the quality of the soil (Peoples et al., 1995; Stevenson and van Kessel, 1996; Unkovich et al., 1997; van Kessel and Hartley, 2000). Unfortunately, legumes are often considered crops of secondary importance, particularly in the Mediterranean regions (Lopez-Bellido et al., 2003), and as a consequence, they are usually grown without adequate crop management. To take advantage of all the benefits legumes can provide, it is necessary to develop more sustainable and environmentally friendly crop management methods, such as conservation tillage and NT. Reducing the intensity of tillage helps mitigate soil erosion (Jordan et al., 2000), increase soil organic matter (West and Post, 2002), improve soil biodiversity (Kladivko, 2001), enhance aggregation and aggregate stability (Madari et al., 2005), and increase water storage in the soil (Radford et al., 1995). Although these improvements often have positive effects on crop growth and yield (De Vita et al., 2007; He et al., 2011; Cullum, 2012; Giambalvo et al., 2012), contradictory results (as well as considerable year-to-year variation) have been reported for comparisons of conservation tillage and CT. For instance, in environments with a cold spring and poorly draining soil, plowing can result in quick soil warming and rapid drainage, leading to an increase in crop yield (Lal, 2007). Much research around the world has compared the performance of cereal crops grown under CT and conservative tillage, but few studies have examined legume crops, particularly in Mediterranean regions, and even fewer have done so by investigating more than one species. Thus, we studied the effects of the use of NT on the productivity of four grain legumes (chickpea, faba bean, field pea, and lentil) typically grown in semiarid Mediterranean regions. As the value of legume crops lies in great part in their ability to fix N2, an ability that can be affected by agronomic management practices such as soil management systems (Horn et al., 1996; Matus et al., 1997; van Kessel and Hartley, 2000), we also studied the effects of the tillage system (NT vs. CT) on N2 fixation and N accumulation by the four species and constructed a simple N balance to assess the incremental changes in soil N associated with each species and tillage technique.

N2  - The article presents statistical data on the dynamics of the development of the Russian agro-industrial complex in the direction of increasing productivity and notes the problems faced by the processing industry (crop products). For successful crop production, plant protection products are used that enter the soil and groundwater, which indirectly affects the state of the environment. The importance of the implementation of the Long-term strategy for the development of the grain complex of the Russian Federation was emphasized. Analyzed data from studies on the storage of grain harvest, which is subjected to fumigation; an assessment of the safety of the tightness of the filled power carriers was carried out. The features of soil, water and air pollution in the zone of influence are discussed. The danger of using pesticides, which create risks of chemical contamination of environmental objects and food products of the population, is emphasized. Statistical information characterizing modern methods of grain storage in the Southern and Central Federal Districts, the pros and cons of these methods are considered. Examples of the practical significance of power runners in the process of grain storage are given (based on data from representatives of the agro-industrial complex). The issues of fumigation of the grain mass at the stage of storage in silobags are touched upon. The possibility of environmental impact of by-products of storage of grain mass is discussed. Ecological aspects of this storage technology are analyzed. Proposals for improving approaches to the storage of grain mass are formulated.

N2  - Fluoride (F) is an anion of halogen family and 13th most abundant element of the earth crust and occurs at about 0.3 gkg–1 of earth’s crust. Fluorides are naturally occur in the form of sodium fluoride or hydrogen fluoride in rocks, coal, clay and soil and released into the environment through the weathering of minerals, emissions from volcanic ash and marine aerosols.1 In water, inorganic fluorides usually remain in solution (as fluoride ions) under conditions of relatively low pH and hardness. Though, F is considered as absolutely non– essential element for plants,2 its presence in soil, air and water causes alterations in physiological, biochemical and structural activities in plants,3 sometimes even without showing any visible symptoms of injury. Jha et al.,3 reported that the order of retention of fluoride in onion was found to be roots > shoot > bulb. Certain plant species have been observed to be injured as a result of the accumulations of excessive fluoride from the atmosphere. The annual global release of hydrogen fluoride from volcanic sources through passive degassing and eruptions range from 60 to 6,000 kilo tons. From which approximately 10% may be introduced directly into the stratosphere.4 Fluoride can also be deposited into soil from several anthropogenic sources i.e. production of phosphate fertilizers, pesticides (such as sulfuryl fluoride), detergents, bricks, tiles and ceramics, and atmospheric pollution from industrial activities (used in aluminum production and as a flux in the steel and glass fiber industries) and burning of fossil fuels.5 Among thermo stable fluoropolymer plastics, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is very common/useful fluorine containing plastic sold and used domestically as cooking utensils due to its heat resistance and nonstick properties. Gaseous fluoride enters into the plant leaves through stomata whereas soil fluoride enters through absorption by roots and subsequently translocated into shoot. Certain plant species accumulate F in their roots and shoots at higher concentrations up to 4000 μgg–1 F without showing any signs of toxicity.6 However, most of other plants show signs of toxicity at relatively much lower F concentration. F affects plant growth and development by interfering with several metabolic pathways associated with photosynthesis, respiration, protein synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and nucleotide synthesis.7,8 Several studies have been reported on F contamination of soil and its effects on different plant species6 including cereals9 and vegetables.10 However, there is little information available on the effects of F on the germination and early growth characteristics of commonly grown crop plants by farmers. The importance of seed germination in plant growth is widely recognized and its study has been used as a model for investigating elemental toxicity. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate and measure the effects of F on the germination, early growth characteristics of seedlings and content of photosynthetic pigments in two important Indian food crops namely Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.).

N2  - Pesticides are poisons designed to kill pests such as rodents, insects, weeds and fungi. Pesticides are, by their nature, toxic chemicals; since many pesticides may potentially leave residues on foods available for human consumption, there is much concern regarding the potential health risks of pesticides in the human diet. Pesticides used in agriculture to control pests, such as insects, weeds, and plant diseases, have been subject to considerable legislative, regulatory, and consumer scrutiny over the past few decades. Pesticides, with their high degree of toxicity, constitute a very important group of target compounds in environmental samples. Those presentnin waters may have an agricultural, domestic or industrial origin, the most harmful effect being their inclusion in the so-called “nutritionchain” (Vinas et al., 2002). Many common pesticides contain potent neurotoxic chemicals that attack and disable portions of the nervous system and brain. The use of pesticides in commercial agriculture has led to an increase in farm productivity (Guler et al., 2010). Pesticides also present environmental concerns including water and soil contamination, air pollution, destruction of natural vegetation, reductions in natural pest populations, effects upon non-target organisms including fish, wildlife, and livestock, creation of secondary pest problems, and the evolution of pesticide resistance (Winter, 2004). Many pesticides were used on a global scale from the 1950s to the mid-80s, most of which are stable and persistent in the environment (Barra et al., 2001). The use of pesticides in agriculture is necessary to combat a variety of pests that could destroy crops and to improve the quality of the food produced. The advantages and disadvantages of pesticide pollution controlling technique are determined by many factors, which require a comprehensive evaluation method adopted in the evaluation of pesticide pollution controlling techniques. Exposure to high levels of pesticides can cause a range of acute, fluand malaria-like symptoms including headaches, weakness, nausea, respiratory distress, convulsions, coma, and death, accounting for an estimated 20,000 fatalities per year (Jiang and Wan, 2009; Guler et al., 2010). In a recent USEPA summary report defined vulnerability applied to risk assessment as a four component system: (1) susceptibility or sensitivity of the human or ecological receptors; (2) differential exposures of the receptors; (3) differential preparedness of the receptor to withstand the insult from exposure; (4) differential ability to recover from these effects. All of these components are pertinent to systems undergoing development from the fetus

N2  - The mean concentrations of 27 chemical elements in eight kinds of fruits and nine kinds of vegetables were estimated from field col­ lections within 11 areas of commercial production. Water-content and ash-yield measurements permitted the element concentrations to be expressed on fresh-, dry-, and ash-weight bases. A three-level sampling design was used; and estimates were made of the chemical variation in the produce from among the areas, among fields within each area, and between sites within fields. Most significant varia­ tion was found to be among areas: concentrations of some elements in some kinds of produce were found to vary tenfold. Soils in which the produce grew were sampled also, and analysis revealed strong differences among areas that are attributed, from place to place, to cultivation practices, contamination by pesticides, or pollution, as well as to climate and underlying geology. In general, little relation­ ship was found between total element concentration in the soil and in the produce that could be assigned to natural causes, but where the soils are highly contaminated the levels of the contaminating element were found to be high in the produce. The concentrations of elements in fruits and vegetables generally differ least in the macronutrients potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sulfur that are essential for plant growth. Trends in concentrations of the micronutrients boron, copper, iron, and zinc are similar but not as pronounced as those of the macronutrients. The concentrations of the nonnutritive nontoxic elements barium, cobalt, lithium, titanium, and zirconium tend to have greater ranges than do those of the nutritive elements. Concentrations of elements generally considered toxic to organisms exhibit erratic distribu­ tions among areas and kinds of produce, and a wide range of values is indicated. INTRODUCTION The chemical elements in food plants are of interest primarily because these plants constitute the major source of essential elements (excluding oxygen and hydrogen) in human nutrition (Underwood, 1971); lesser amounts of these elements are derived from water, soil and rocks, and air. The elements contained in the plants may be consumed directly in vegetables and fruits, or indirectly in meat and milk from animals that have eaten the plants. Numerous studies have been made of the elements in man's total diet, and analyses of many food plants are given in the reports of the studies. A lack of uniformity among these studies exists, however, in sampling techniques, methods of analyses, kinds of plants sampled, and bases used for reporting element concentrations. In­ adequate, or no, descriptions of the origins of the samples further reduce the usefulness of many reports. A National Research Council report (Morrison and others, 1974, p. 92) stated, "no systematic study has been made of sampling of fruits and vegetables for trace elements. More attention has been paid to food processing and its effect on changes in trace element composition of fruits and vegetables." The effects of processing on the element content of food plants cannot be determined unless reliable bases are available for estimating the typical concentrations of the elements that are in the edible portion of the plants as they grow in the field. Regulations governing allowable increases or decreases of element content caused by processing food should take into account not only the concentrations of elements of interest char­ acteristic of the different food plants, but also the variation in chemical composition of the plants among the areas of commercial production throughout the country. Some fruits and vegetables are consumed that have had little or no processing; therefore, the introduction of extraneous elements is minimal, and only the elements acquired by the plants while growing in the field are generally present. Yet the sources and concen­ trations of elements in these, as well as in other, food plants may be greatly different among areas where the plants are grown, as influenced by factors of soil chemistry, agricultural practices, climate, and the ex­ tent to which environmental pollution affects the pro­ duce. Plant species react differently to these influences on element content because of their genetic control of growth processes and characteristics. If the edible parts of the plant are leaves and stems, atmospheric pollution may considerably influence the kinds and concentrations of elements in these parts. If roots or tubers are used for food, the elements in the soil may exert the greatest effect, whereas if fruits are the edible portion, only the elements that can be readily ELEMENTS IN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, CONTERMINOUS UNITED STATES transported from the roots to the fruit are likely to be greatly influenced by differences in geochemical environments. Quarter-man (1973, p. 171) stated, "The amount of a particular trace element in a plant food can depend on the species of plant, the breed or strain, and which part of the plant is eaten. It can also depend on the season of the year and the climate, on the soil type and pH, the proximity of other plants, manuring and various forms of contamination." These factors may differ greatly among regions of foodplant production; there­ fore their influence creates an interest in determining the presence and extent of regional variation in the elemental composition of fruits and vegetables. The chemical composition of fruits and vegetables is of interest to the growers of produce because it can be used as an index of the nutritional status of the plants. Some large-scale commercial operations make frequent analyses of the plants during the growing season for as many as eight elements; deficiencies in elements that may affect yield or market quality are determined and are promptly corrected by soil or foliar applications of the deficient elements. Analyses are commonly made of leaf or stem tissue, but may also use fruit tissue. In addition, visible symptoms of specific element defi­ ciencies may be used to initiate corrective measures. The data on elemental composition of food plants given in reports of these practices are of limited usefulness in establishing baseline values to be applied to problems of human nutrition, because the emphasis in these reports is on plant nutrition or pathology. These reports include, however, maximum concentra­ tions of certain elements in the plants, concentrations that are potentially toxic to humans. Examples of com­ prehensive studies of this type include those of Goodall and Gregory (1947), Chapman (1966), and Kenworthy (1967). The emphasis in fruit and vegetable growing is on an adequate yield of produce that is of acceptable market quality to return a profit to the grower. Quality in this context is measured by the ability of the produce to withstand harvesting, processing, and marketing operations, and to be adequate in such factors as color, flavor, and texture. The nutritional value of the pro­ duce generally is given only minor, or no, considera­ tion, although Beeson (1957, p. 258) pointed out, "The term 'crop quality' means both marketable quality and nutritional quality of a crop* * *. Nature has not always combined two aspects of crop quality in one package, and man has seldom improved matters in his efforts to breed plants and manage soil so as to pro­ duce crops that are both attractive and high yielding." A task force of the Food and Drug Administration (Miller, 1974) proposed monitoring the content of two elements, magnesium and calcium (along with protein; vitamins A, B6, and C; thiamin; riboflavin; and niacin) in nine food crops. It would seem to be of equal or greater importance to monitor some other elements that, for man, are obtained principally from food plants—copper, for example. In a paper giving quantitative data on the occur­ rence in plant tissue of 71 of the 94 naturally occurring elements, 46 elements were reported in measurable concentrations in the edible portion of food plants (Shacklette and others, 1978). The mean concentra­ tions, deviations, and observed ranges of 30 elements in many vegetables were reported by Connor and Shacklette (1975), who gave element values for the material actually analyzed, whether it consisted of plant ash or dry plant material. Extensive tables giving element concentrations in many food plants were published by Beeson (1941), Monier-Williams (1949), and Diem (1962); and although the data in these reports generally based the concentrations on dry weight of the plant material, values based on fresh weight occur at places. Only the report by Diem gave the water content of the material that was analyzed. The absence of clearly stated bases for calculating element concentrations in samples of foods and other biological materials is a deficiency in many published reports, and for these one can only assume which bases were used (that is, fresh weight, dry weight, or ash weight) by judging the kind of material analyzed and the magnitude of the concentrations that were reported. The use of various bases for expressing element concentrations in organic materials was discussed by Goodall and Gregory (1947) and is also discussed later in this report. The elemental composition of a variety of foods from tropical plants was given by Duke (1970) in an ethnobotanical report on some Central American In­ dians. Many reports of the elements in foods have been published by U.S. Government agencies, including the Department of Agriculture handbooks (for example, see Watt and Merrill, 1950, which gives both water and ash contents of the food plants that were analyzed). Most of these reports include only the major and minor nutritive elements. The concern with environmental contamination has resulted in many publications which include food-plant analyses for toxic elements. In a report on toxicants occurring naturally in foods, Underwood (1973) pro­ vided some background ran

N2  - Chlorinated hydrocarbons as one group of synthetic pesticides have been in common use since 1945. They are characterized by their stability, residual effect, insolubility in water, and relative specific action. Dieldrin is a widely used pesticide which has been employed for the control of termites and agricultural insects in corn, alfalfa, lawns, turfs, and flowers, and also in household sprays.' Although the use of dieldrin has been restricted in New York State to the control of termites, lumber insects, sod and soil, potential contamination of food items still exists. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are known to last for long periods in the environment, not necessarily at the site of application. Food represents the most important carrier of chemical contamination, including pesticides, being an end product of the three components of the environment-air, water and soil. Unavoidable bactericidal operations, environmental pollution, natural sources, and human error often result in such contamination. The major sources of chlorinated hydrocarbons in food are those of animal origin, namely, milk and dairy products, meat, fish and poultry. Studies conducted by the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies during the 1960s have indicated that these foods are the source of approximately one-half of the total intake of chlorinated hydrocarbon residues.2 Pesticide residues in milk and dairy prod-

N2  - In the general population, serum concentrations of DDT and DDE are reflective of incidental exposure to this pesticide. Theorectically such exposure could be due to contamination of food, air, water or other sources; previous studies based on pesticide concentrations in food had concluded that 80-90 percent of human exposure were from dietary source of DDT. Recent studies on the distribution of these residues in several populations have not entirely supported this concept and in warmer climates the data has suggested that non-dietary sources, particularly dust, are a significant mechanism of DDT pollution in man. A health and pollution serological survey in an isolated island in the Caribbean provided an ideal opportunity to test this hypothesis. In a survey of 254 islanders average serum total DDT residues were almost twice as high than the matched controls from the mainland in South Florida. Studies of DDT concentrations in food, air and water revealed only trace amounts of this pesticide, but in 15 homes the average total DDT concentrations in house dust were 129 ppm as compared to only 8.5 ppm in the exterior soils. The data showed that house dust was a sample of air collected from the interior of a home after sweeping from particles of 0.3 micron size, suggested that inhalation may be another mechanism of incidental exposure. A pesticide use questionnaire revealed that 45 percent of persons using domestic pesticides favoured a 5 percent DDT spray solution for the control of roaches and flies; average serum total DDT levels were 117 ppb on the island compared to 68 ppb in Dade County and no obvious adverse health effects were observed with the serum concentrations of DDT and its metabolites (AU)

N2  - Marbled salamanders, Ambystoma opacum, utilize vernal pools for breeding and development, but many of these pools are in agricultural and urbanized habitats which can lead to polluted, toxic conditions within pools. This experiment studied the effects of road runoff and agricultural runoff on the development of marbled salamander larvae. Three agricultural vernal pools and three roadside vernal pools containing salamander larvae were visited twice, one in the beginning of the winter and once toward the end of winter. During visits, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and pH were measured and larvae were collected using dips-nets to assess abundance and length. Water samples and sediment samples were also collected from pools to test for metal, pesticide, chlorophyll, and nutrient concentrations. During the second visits, two roadside pools no longer contained larvae, and overall, agricultural pools had slightly greater larval growth and abundance than the roadside pools. Roadside pools generally had higher conductivity, lower dissolved oxygen, and greater metal concentrations while agricultural pools had greater chlorophyll concentrations. However, there was no statistically significant difference in water quality and salamander development between the two vernal pool classifications. Based on results, the mortality of larvae in the two roadside pools was attributed to road salt applications used during the winter and general runoff of metals from roads. No pesticides were detected in agricultural pools so further research during the spring could be important to assessing the effect of landscape on local salamander populations. Introduction Amphibians are a unique group of tetrapods with biphasic life histories consisting of an aquatic larval stage and a terrestrial adult phase. Gelatinous amphibian eggs must remain in a wet environment throughout development of the embryo and larvae have external gills that must remain in water for respiration until metamorphosis. This aquatic larval stage makes amphibians highly dependent on water. LARVAL SALAMANDER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A LANDSCAPE GRADIENT 3 Even terrestrial adults amphibians, which have thin, scaleless skin for respiration, are susceptible to desiccation and must constantly keep their skin moist (Julian, 2000). Salamanders are part of the order Caudata which is part of the class Amphibia. Like most amphibians, salamanders hatch from aquatic eggs as larvae with external gills and metamorphose into air-breathing, terrestrial adults. However, life histories and breeding characteristics can vary among salamander species. Marbled salamanders, Ambystoma opacum, utilize vernal pools for breeding and development (Turtle, 2000; Figure 1). Vernal pools are ephemeral wetlands or pools of varying size that periodically dry up. Marbled salamanders arrive at these pools during the fall, when pools are dry (Figure 2). Mating occurs on land and eggs are deposited by females under debris along pool margins, and when the pools fill with winter rain or snow melt, low oxygen levels trigger the eggs to hatch. Larvae spend the winter and spring in the pool developing, metamorphosing, and preying on other pool organisms including plants, invertebrates, and spring-breeding amphibians (Calhoun & deMaynadier, 2007). Salamanders play vital roles in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. After an extensive study, researchers Davic and Welsh (2004) found six ways in which salamanders act as dominant keystone species in the local ecosystem: (1) they provide energy and nutrients for terrestrial and aquatic consumers; (2) they regulate energy pathways and the release of minerals by maintaining invertebrate populations; (3) they increase the diversity of lower trophic taxa by reducing competitively dominant prey; (4) they serve as pathways for energy and matter between aquatic and terrestrial landscapes due to their biphasic lifestyle; (5) they facilitate soil dynamics by modifying underground refugia; (6) they enhance forest stability by converting and storing large amounts of secondary production through their biomass (Davic & Welsh, 2004). Overall, they concluded that salamanders perform key ecological roles by consuming a variety of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates within terrestrial and aquatic environments, and that salamander density is linked to prey density, trophic cascades, nutrient cycling, LARVAL SALAMANDER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A LANDSCAPE GRADIENT 4 and detritus-litter food webs (Davic & Welsh, 2004).Their study also shows that the loss of salamanders could have serious negative effects on ecosystem stability, and it is this ecological importance of salamanders that makes salamanders and vernal pools so important. However, amphibian populations are declining globally and understanding the factors associated with their declines is necessary in order to preserve ecologically important species. Of the 234 identified salamander species, over two-thirds are ranked “imperiled or critically imperiled”, and yet only 13 species are protected or have been proposed for protection under the Endangered Species Act (Davic & Welsh, 2004). Dr. Calhoun of University of Maine Orono says there are five common threats to amphibians: disease, invasive species, commercial exploitation, climate change, and habitat loss and alteration (Calhoun & deMaynadier, 2007). Habitat loss and alteration is thought to be the greatest threat to amphibian species, and chemical contamination and pollution are considered forms of habitat alteration. Amphibians need moisture for respiration, reproduction, and development which makes them highly dependent on local water sources and the high permeability of amphibian skin and egg masses also makes them highly vulnerable to water contamination (Calhoun & deMaynadier, 2007). Many larval salamanders are also detritus feeders and can directly ingest contaminants in the sediment (Julian 2000). Roadside ditches provide vernal pool-like environments that can be utilized by aquatic and wetland species such as marbled salamanders. However, water rapidly runs off the impervious surface of roads and can carry toxic materials to vernal pools. Sediments, herbicides, vehicular NOX emissions, hydrocarbons from petroleum, and metals like lead, zinc, copper, chromium, and cadmium are common contaminants in roadside vernal pools that have shown to increase amphibian mortality (Forman & Alexander, 1998). The ingestion of petroleum and silt can result in liver and respiratory issues in amphibians and other aquatic species. Deicing of roads and increased salt runoff has shown to decrease egg mass density and larval survival of salamanders (Karraker et al., 2008). LARVAL SALAMANDER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A LANDSCAPE GRADIENT 5 Many vernal pools are also closely associated with agricultural fields which can be sources of pollution. Agricultural runoff can result in pesticide and nutrient contamination of nearby vernal pools. Pesticides have shown to increase deformities and decrease hatching by directly affecting the nervous and endocrine system of amphibians or by indirectly affecting food sources (Rohr et al., 2003). GriffisKyle and Richie (2007) found that nitrogen levels are highest in surface waters in temperate climates during snowmelt, which is the same time marbled salamander eggs and larvae are developing. In their study, high nitrogen levels resulted in decreased hatching of eggs, decreased growth rates, slower development, and increased physical abnormalities. However, other studies have shown that nutrient runoff from agricultural fields can increase primary productivity and therefore increase food availability in pools which can increase salamander development rates and survival (Gray, Smith, & Brenes, 2004). Many studies have found that contaminants have varying effects on amphibian species, and that in the field, contaminants can work together to create different effects across amphibian life stages. This experiment aims to analyze the effects of road runoff and agricultural runoff on the development of salamander species, Ambystoma opacum. This will be done by evaluating water quality parameters and growth of salamander larvae within two different classifications of vernal pools: agricultural and roadside, at Chino Farms in Kingstown, Maryland. The purpose of this experiment is to monitor how these different landscapes affect salamander survival in the field and to address possible conservation strategies based off its findings. Methods During the fall of 2013, potential sites were found by surveying the Chino Farms area in Kingstown, Maryland for vernal pools likely utilized by marbled salamanders. In January, after the vernal pools filled and eggs were estimated to hatch, potential sites were visited to determine which contained marbled salamanders. Of the potential sites, 6 vernal pools contained marbled salamander larvae and LARVAL SALAMANDER GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A LANDSCAPE GRADIENT 6 were used as test sites for the experiment (Figure 3, Figure 4). The distance between the pools and either an agricultural field or road was measured using base aerial imagery and measuring tools in ArcGIS. Pools were then classified as agricultural or roadside based on whether they were within 10m to an agricultural field or road. Due to the landscape of the area, no woodland or forested vernal pools were found; all salamander-containing pools were closely located near agricultural fields and roads. Each test site was visited two times within a two-month period; first during the third week of January 2014 and then during the second week of March 2014. At each visit, larval salamanders were collected using dip-nets. Salamanders were collected for 100 dips or until 50 larvae were collected. After larvae were found in a dip-net, they were transferred to a bucket filled with water from the vernal pool. Individually, larvae were taken from t

N2  - In this study, an urban soil was amended with some commonly used fertilisers and effects on the concentrations and bioavailabilities of potentially toxic metals (PTM) studied through plant uptake experiment. A suite of PTM (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, U, and Zn) was quantified in sample digests and extracts using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Uptake of PTM by bean plants grown in 2% chicken manure amended soil, and by radish grown in 2% chicken manure, 0.2% growmore fertiliser or 2% chicken manure + 0.2% growmore fertiliser amended soil were studied. The PTM concentrations in control bean plant exceeded those in bean plants grown in chicken manure amended soil, and a similar trend was observed for radish, suggesting that chicken manure addition can decrease PTM bioavailability to plants. Addition of growmore fertiliser resulted in plants with similar PTE burden to control plants. It was found that EDTA-extraction of soil generally overestimated actual plant uptake of PTM. Overwhelming metals can collect and move in soil situations. Because of their combined impacts and long haul associations, aggregation of overwhelming metals in soil contrarily influences local eco-security and represents a danger to pertinent creatures and plants. Moreover, overwhelming metals can enter human bodies through the evolved way of life, prompting an expanded frequency of incessant ailments, for example, deformation and malignant growth (Muller and Anke 1994; Ramadan and Al-Ashkar 2007; Tembo et al. 2006). Studies have demonstrated that foods grown from the ground utilization is the essential pathway of human presentation to overwhelming metals (Adamsa et al. 2004; McLaughlin et al. 1999). Along these lines, it is of down to earth noteworthiness to survey the degree of substantial metal collection from soil into plants, for example, foods grown from the ground, and significant research has increased expanding considerations. The practices of metal in soils are extremely perplexing, which include adsorption–desorption, complexation–separation, oxidation–decrease, particle trade, and other transporter transport job. The previous two responses mostly influence metal movement in soil, while oxidation–decrease can likewise change metal valence (Swartjes et al. 2007). These concoction instruments can cooperate and influence each other, which shaped an intricate association framework controlling metal destinies. Overwhelming metals enter the vegetable tissues principally through the roots and foliage, of which root take-up was the prevailing pathway. Metals can be moved from soil pore water into the plants however the roots as disintegrated particles (e.g., Cd2+) (McLaughlin et al. 2011). Arrangement of complex procedures happen in the dirt pore water and yield rhizosphere. The level of metal improvement in harvests can be portrayed with enhancement factor, which is characterized as the proportion of a specific component content in a plant to that in soil. The idea of enhancement factor was first proposed by Zoller et al. (1974) for source finding of barometrical particulate issue in the Antarctic. In the next year, advancement factor was utilized for examining high-height air substances in the North Atlantic Ocean (Duce et al. 1975). As of late, the use of advancement factor as move factor, bioconcentration factor (BCF), and plant take-up factor has been extended to examine on soil, water framework, and silt, just as evaluation of overwhelming metal contamination in natural geochemistry (Wang et al. 2006a, b; Khan et al. 2010; Brioschi et al. 2013; Delgado et al. 2012). In soil investigate, BCF is characterized as the proportion of the substance of a specific component in a plant to that in soil. BCF is a significant quantitative marker of harvest pollution and has regularly been utilized for evaluating metal exchange from soil into plants (Garcia et al. 2009; Melgar et al. 2009; USEPA 2005). BCF-based research shows that the degree of metal advancement in vegetables is most noteworthy in leaf vegetables, trailed by tubers and leafy foods (et al. 2012; Pandey and Pandey 2009). With respect to fixations, cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) usually happen at significant levels in leaf vegetables while the Zn substance of tubers is higher than other metal substance(Ngole2011). The bioavailability and poisonousness of metals in soil are essentially affected by pH condition (Badawy et al. 2002; Wang et al. 2006b). Soil pH is viewed as one of the most significant variables that impact the exchange of Cd and Pb from soil to plants, and higher pH esteems have been found to lessen the bioavailability and harmfulness of Cd and Pb (McBride et al. 1997; Gray et al. 1999). There are numerous scientists who give themselves to the exploration on the connection between soil pH and Cd take-up (Costa and Morel 1993; Hart et al. 2002; Kim et al. 2002; Tudorean and Phillips 2004; McLaughlin et al. 2011). The predictable end is that the adsorption between soil particles and Cd increments with the expansion of soil pH, while Cd bioavailability diminished. The component for this marvel can add to the increments of solvency and particle rivalry. As the dirt pH diminishes, the convergences of Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+ increment in soil arrangement, which upgrade the opposition of free particles and decrease the adsorption to soil particles (Tudorean and Phillips 2004). Also, Speir et al. (2003) announced that dirt pH is the best determinant of the solvency and versatility of chromium (Cr), Pb and Zn in a sandy soil. Because of the nearby connection between soil pH and overwhelming metal properties, relationship investigation of pH worth and substantial metal collection is generally applied in inquire about on amassing of substantial metal from soil to vegetables. Conceivably harmful metal (PTM) tainting in soil are across the board and defilement could be from topographical sources or from or anthropogenic sources. The sources of these PTM (e.g Cd, Cr, Pb and Zn) incorporate soil parent material, volcanic emissions, composts, pesticides sewage slop, power station, autos, burning of waste also, squander removal, metal refining plants, mines and so on The tainting of these poisonous metals in rural land is a significant concern. Possibly poisonous metals in soil can bioaccumulate in plants and are moved to the natural pecking order where they raise human and creature wellbeing concern. Once these possibly harmful metals are haunted by plants, they will enter the food chain and might be taken up by people and creatures prompting antagonistic wellbeing impact. Album, Cr and Pb are of concern since they are harmful to plants and creatures indeed, even in little focuses; anyway Zn is a basic follow metal for plants and creature yet can be risky at high focuses (Wolnik et al., 1983). At high focuses these metals show ceaseless poisonousness or cancer-causing nature just as casualty.

Food Safety is a very important issue for the environment and public health. Air, soil and water pollutants exposed to agricultural products in agricultural areas threaten food safety considerably. Apart from air, soil and water pollutants, our food is exposed to many food pollution from production to consumption. Food additives, pesticides, hormones, use of fertilizers, genetically modified organisms, wastes, sewage and septic leaks as a result of lack of infrastructure, microbiological pollution, radiation residues, food contaminating contaminants during the packaging and storage, mycotoxins etc. affect food safety and hence human health negatively. The aim of this study is to provide information about the main sources of contamination in foods and the precautions that can be taken for safe food production.

N2  - Agriculture, with almost equal share of the twin farming systems of crop production and livestock development, characterizes the key issues of Ethiopian economy. The first green revolution could not have got its momentum in Ethiopia due to limitations associated mainly with improved varieties, assured irrigation and, inorganic fertilizers. The continued efforts in crop varieties improvement, inventorying of soil resources, watershed development, and related activities have now amplified the potential of Ethiopia to revolutionize its agricultural developments both livestock and crop productions. However, the message from the first green revolution in terms of soil health deterioration leading to malnutrition, polluted foodstuff and water and other types of contamination of agricultural products due to excessive use of inorganic fertilizers, chemicals, insecticides and pesticides has bitterly warned the scientists and even planners to move to some compromise in the use of inorganic materials as inputs. The use of organic resources alone or in integration with inorganic materials is the quick answer to such compromise. Needless to mention, the use of organic resources for soil fertility management is virtually known almost since the beginning of agriculture. In the same fashion, the present human population world-wide wants food stuff free of pollution, contamination or even adulteration caused by unwise and unscientific use of inorganic fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals, which were the main bearing to the yield increase during the first green revolution at the expense of the quality of the produces. The second green revolution relates to restoration of quality of produce and improvement of soil health and quality. Obviously, organic farming approach is the only option for its realization. The quality of organic resources and their fertilizer equivalence are the main criteria to be judged for effective utilization of the organic resources for soil fertility improvement and promotion of agricultural products both in quantity and quality. The contents of organic carbon, total nitrogen, lignin, polyphenol and C:N ratios are some of the basic parameters to be considered in quality assessment of the organic resources. Under natural environments, there are many plant species that are useful to soil fertility improvement, but our knowledge is limited. Knowledge of organic matter turnover in soils is of vital importance in order to estimate the amount of organic resource to be added to soils to maintain the organic matter status. Soils with high C:N ratio need to have very specific management practices. The enhancement of N and P status of soils with exposures to X-rays is recently established for further validation as well as application either in field or otherwise. The clue of second green revolution lies on quality improvement of agricultural produces and this could be achieved by how could the integration of organic resource with very selective amount of inorganic fertilizers be made effective for high yields without any scope of abuse due to degradation. The considerable demand and relatively higher market values of the organically produced crop as well as livestock products for being free from pollution, high quality and healthy foodstuff are obviously positive additives and better bargaining power in the compromises with the possible reduction in quantity of yield in the short term from minimizing the use of mineral fertilizers and other agricultural chemicals.

REFERENCES 19 ANNEXURES: I-III CSE Report: Analysis of Pesticide Residues in blood samples from villages of Punjab. The Centre for Science and Environment, a non-governmental organisation based in New Delhi, has set up the Pollution Monitoring Laboratory (PML) to monitor environmental pollution. Its main aim is to undertake scientific studies to create public awareness about food, water, air and other environmental contamination. It is equipped with state of art equipments for the monitoring and analysis of air, water, food and other environmental contamination, including High Performance Liquid nominal cost to communities that cannot obtain scientific evidence against polluters in their area. Given the state of scientific research in India-most of it being restricted to national defense and food security-this is an effort to use science to achieve ecological security. Pesticide is a general term for substances, which are used to poison pests (weeds, insects, molds, rodents etc.). The pesticides most acutely dangerous to humans are insecticides and rodenticides. Synthetic pesticides have been popular with farmers, because of their widespread availability, simplicity in application, efficacy and economic returns. But they also have huge environmental costs. pesticide use has high growth potential in India, as the use of agricultural pesticides is markedly low at 0.54 kg /ha as against 3.7 kg/ha in USA and 2.7 kg/ha in Europe. Notwithstanding the fact that overall consumption of pesticides in India as a whole is low than that used in the developed countries of the world, there is still a widespread contamination of water, soil and air with pesticide residues. In India, among different states maximum consumption of pesticides-1999-2000 was in Uttar Pradesh (3646 MT). Leading pesticides used in India include monocrotophos (10700 MT-highest consumed), acephate (6400MT), endosulfan (5600 MT) and chlorpyrifos (5000 MT-fourth highest consumed). About 54% of the total pesticides used in Indian agriculture are consumed on cotton alone, though it accounts for only 5% of the total cultivated area (Puri et al, 1999) and nearly 20-25 per cent are used for the control of sucking pests and bollworm. Pesticides have become integral part of villagers in Punjab.

N2  - The Second Agricultural Services Producer Organizations Project for Senegal is a national agricultural program on rural activities, mainly in the field of agriculture and animal husbandry. This environmental and social management framework gives an assessment of the environmental and social impacts, both beneficial and adverse that the project may entail, when implemented in whatever agro ecological area that may be concerned. Expected negative impacts associated with subprojects include: misuse of chemical pesticides and water pollution in the irrigation system; loss of pasturage for livestock and land degradation arising from overuse; clogging of the drainage system from stored materials, and interference with natural habitats if not ecosystem destruction; flooding; disease spread because of stagnant waters (including malaria and bilharzia) water contamination leading to dysentery and other diseases due to non-use of latrines and other unhygienic practices; conflicts over water usage; noise during blasting; erosion; soil salinization; the reduction of land able to be cultivated; lack of veterinary medicines; over-exploitation of forests; risk of contamination from pharmaceuticals improperly stored within households; environmental pollution from wastewater and solid waste from livestock; risk of marginalization of small producers due to market segmentation, the rise in the meat prices, infrastructure modernization and their maintenance costs, and unemployment of informal sector workers; loss of vegetal cover and increased erosion; lowering of the water table; and contamination due to pesticide use; air pollution and noxious odors; contamination of food products; and risk of fire, among other impacts. Mitigation measures may include: the rational use of pesticides, reserving spaces for foraging, restoring soil fertility, training farmers and farmer organizations to maintain flood works and in animal hygiene and veterinary techniques; latrine construction; conflict resolution used to control water usage; building of troughs and wells; installing of pumps far from residences; building irrigation canals for the dry season; replacing excavated material; providing compensation to displaced persons; using drainage works; replanting trees; integrated management of water resources; avoiding prolonged food storage; ensuring that imported animals are disease-free (have a certificate of health); encouraging traditional/local pastoral practices/indigenous knowledge and technical innovation, and improving traditional infrastructure; restoring the vegetal cover; establishing a waste management plan; promoting the use of organic fertilizer (manure); making selective site choices; wearing protective gear to avoid pesticide poisoning; avoiding the introduction of exotic species even if the risk is low; treating wastewater according to international norms; and raising sensitivity of sexually transmitted diseases among workers.

N2  - Having been a mainly Western concern in the past, food safety is emerging as a topic in China and the Chinese state is becoming more and more involved in securing the quality of China’s agricultural goods. Nevertheless, Chinese food security seems unlikely to be controlled in the near future, as China’s real amount of vast environmental contamination is unknown. This is worrisome since nearly all Chinese environmental ambits are affected by pollution: We show that China’s growing heavy industry and fossil fuel centered power production sectors have become major emitters of air pollutants, such as SO2, NO2 or Hg, especially the level of mercury emissions from coal combustion and other related sources in China has recently come into focus with regard to food safety issues. The uncontrolled use of inorganic fertilizer leads to serious problems caused by high contents of pesticides in soils. Also the rapid growth of the Chinese steal sector adds to soil pollution in many areas of the country. Water pollution, already a widely recognized Chinese problem, aggravates the food safety situation, as it transports toxic substances into the Chinese food chain and functions thus as a bridge between different origins of pollution. Experts argue that exact numbers of the catastrophe’s scope are still not available, what sharpens the issues incalculability regarding China’s food safety.

N2  - Based on the available information, about 96% of the world's total freshwater resources are in underground forms. Therefore, a main part of worldwide population in both urban and rural areas depends on groundwater resources as the sole drinking water source. The crucial role groundwater plays as a decentralized source of drinking water for millions rural and urban families cannot be overstated. It accounts for nearly 80% of the rural domestic water needs, and 50% of the urban water needs in India. The natural impurities in rainwater, which replenishes groundwater systems, get removed while infiltrating through soil strata. But, In India, where groundwater is used intensively for irrigation and industrial purposes, a variety of land and water-based human activities are causing pollution of this precious resource, such as using pesticides for agricultural use. Its over-exploitation is causing aquifer contamination in certain instances. Modern agriculture practices reveal an increase in use of pesticides and fertilizers to meet the food demand of increasing population which results in contamination of the environment. In India crop production increased to 100% but the cropping area has increased marginally by 20%. Pesticides have played a major role in achieving the maximum crop production, but maximum usage and accumulation of pesticide residues was highly toxic to ground water, agricultural land, aquatic life, human life and other ecosystem. Use of pesticides in agriculture may lead to the contamination of groundwater resources. In fact, it has been estimated that less than 0.1% of the pesticide applied to crops actually reaches the target pest and the remaining enters the environment unreasonably and thus contaminates soil, water, and air, in which it can poison or adversely affect nontarget organisms. 9 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended classification of pesticides by hazardto organism.. Application of banned and expired pesticides, unsustainable and uncontrolled consumption of pesticides, the lack of farmers' knowledge about the safe use of pesticides, and the lack of proper supervision by relevant organizations can cause more contamination of water resources in developing countries. The problem has become more prominent where groundwater aquifers are used as the main source for drinking purposes.

T1  - Effectiveness of Strategic Environmental Assessment of urban and regional planning in Northern Italy: limitation of risks and impact of land consumption
A1  - Treville, Aldo
Y1  - 2012///
N2  - In Italian SEA of urban and regional planning, there is low awareness of the natural risks and impact of land consumption, reflecting the misconception of soil degradation impact on water, human health, climate change, nature, biodiversity, protection, and food safety. Recently enhanced planning practices account for land protection objectives, but they are still not properly justified, assessed, and compared to different alternatives; and consequently not respected due to lack of adequate monitoring. The paper focuses on exploring the potential of SEA as an effective tool for improving urban and regional planning processes, in respect to natural risks, such as land consumption, soil degradation and urban sprawl. Some SEA of Italian and foreign cases are presented, underlining how they were able to create more awareness of soil as a common good and as a resource, and how this new awareness can lead to the integration of often neglected environmental and risks considerations into the planning process. Natural risk and impact of land consumption Soil has a generally underestimated value in land use planning, and it should be considered as important as other resources in the pursuit of sustainable development. Studies from the last 50 years have provided lots of references to the soil/land value as a “common”, and its intrinsic fragility, bringing up the issue of a consequent need for protection. Hardin's article is an example (Hardin, 1968): herders sharing a common parcel of land, with interest to put the next cows, even if the quality of the common is damaged through overgrazing, and the common is depleted or even destroyed, to the detriment of all. Diamond wrote about how societies collapse because of the disregard for increasing environmental issues (Diamond, 2005), providing several examples of the contribution of environmental components, such as soil problems (erosion, salinization, and soil fertility losses). In order to avoid “tragedy” or “collapse”, soil should be acknowledged among the other commons to have a tremendous value for the community. It is a direct consequence the need of governing the commons, in order to save them and manage their use for the community; “governing the commons” in the sense as Ostrom masterfully presented on her book (Ostrom, 2006). Soil clearly has a strong social and cultural value, but also from an environmental point of view it has demonstrated a fundamental contribution to several functions: climate change/CO2 sequestration, ecology system and biodiversity, groundwater recharge, food and agriculture, landscape. Despite its value, soil and landscape have been poorly taken into consideration in Italian planning in recent decades, and more specifically by Italian citizens. In fact, as underlined by Settis, in the last decades “mountains, Effectiveness of Strategic Environmental Assessment of urban and regional planning in Northern Italy: limitation of risks and impact of land consumption Name of author 2 countryside, coasts, are being less and less taken into consideration as a treasure of the citizens, instead they are seen as an easy hunting reserve for who is cynically destroying the commons for their interest” (Settis, 2010). As currently defined, soil is “the top layer of the earth’s crust, formed by mineral particles, organic matter, water, air and living organisms. It is the interface between earth, air and water and hosts most of the biosphere”; for the purpose of this paper, soil can be referred to the rural land, not yet urbanized, and its intrinsic value. Land, somehow confused with soil, instead is generally defined as “the part of the earth's surface that is not covered by water”; for the purpose of this paper, land includes territorial and spatial dimensions, and it is considered as the object of land use planning. Furthermore in this paper, soil consumption refers to the concept of “land take”, also known as "urbanization", "increase of artificial surfaces" and represents an increase of settlement areas (or artificial surfaces) over time, usually at the expense of rural areas; this process results in an increase of scattered settlements in rural regions or in an expansion of urban areas around an urban nucleus (urban sprawl). Soil consumption has negative effects and impact on environmental, social, economic resources. Soil is in fact an extremely complex, variable and living medium; the interface between the earth, the air and the water, soil is a non-renewable resource which performs many vital functions: food and other biomass production, storage, filtration and transformation of many substances including water, carbon, nitrogen. Soil has a role as a habitat and gene pool, serves as a platform for human activities, landscape and heritage and acts as a provider of raw materials (European Commission, 2006; EAA 2006; European JRC, 2008). Soil should be seen as a public service, a public right, like other resources such as water and air. Land use planning effects all soil threats and its impact need to be taken into account when planning the sustainable use of the land, such as impact on: soil sealing, soil erosion, decline in Soil Organic Matter (SOM), soil contamination, soil compaction, decline in soil biodiversity, soil salinization, landslides, desertification. Many studies show that European soil degradation is accelerating, with a variety of negative effects on human health, natural ecosystems and climate change, as well as on the economy; individual ecosystem services that are affected by land use transition also include the production of food, regulation of energy and matter flows, water supply, supply of recreational space, biodiversity or natural aesthetic values (Nuissl H, Haase D, Lanzendorf M, Wittmer H., 2009). The objective of soil protection and SEA Different European policies are contributing to soil protection (for instance on water, waste, chemicals, industrial pollution prevention, nature protection, pesticides, agriculture) but there is a lack of an integrated strategic policy. As these policies have other aims and scopes of action, they might not be sufficient to ensure an adequate level of protection for all soil in Europe. Given the complexity of the soil consumption impact, an integrated policy and planning tool is needed to cope with soil protection issues. Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) refers to a range of "analytical and participatory approaches that aim to integrate environmental considerations into policies, plans and programmes and evaluate the inter-linkages with economic and social considerations". According to SEA Directive, competent planning authorities are obliged to accomplish a systematic assessment of all significant environmental impacts of regional land use plans (Art. 3 para. 2 SEA Directive). The procedure of SEA suits the purpose of an integrated assessment of land use issues, and it can be effective being inextricably linked to decision-making. SEA, by law (SEA Directive): • evaluates the likely significant effects on the environment, including issues such as soil, water, air, landscape; • integrates environmental considerations and evaluates the inter-linkage with economic and social considerations (soil as a ‘common’); • includes monitoring (i.e. on land consumption) Additionally, the SEA report, being a decision-support instrument aimed at providing as detailed a picture as possible of the environmental impact related to the implementation of a land use plan, must contain sufficient information to assess the acceptability of the impact of soil consumption, and consequently to propose suitable modifications and mitigations. 1 ENVASSO Project: ENVironmental ASsessment of Soil for monitoring (www.envasso.com) 2 Oxford dictionary, Oxford University Press, 2011 3 OECD DAC SEA Guidance, 2006 4 SEA Directive, 2001/42/EC Effectiveness of Strategic Environmental Assessment of urban and regional planning in Northern Italy: limitation of risks and impact of land consumption Name of author 3 Land consumption in Italian SEA In the last few decades in Italy, there has been massive urbanization disproportionate to the demographic increase, and mostly in the Po Valley (area including Regions Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, Veneto, Piedmont), where each day 200.000 m are urbanized, “about 30 soccer fields” (Legambiente Report, 2011) Italy, unlike most European countries, does not have a national spatial development plan, nor a definition of soil sealing limits and targets (like in Germany, UK, Austria). Regional Territorial Plans are the planning tools that rule land use in Italy and therefore they have the most important role in limiting land consumption. Emilia –Romagna and Lombardy, the two Regions that cover the main part of the Po Valley, recently approved their Territorial Plans. Regional Territorial Plan of Emilia Romagna (Italy), limitation of land consumption The new Regional Territorial Plan (2010) of Emilia – Romagna, includes an evident objective on the limitation of land consumption. Starting from the analysis of the soil “artificialization” of the region territory (land consumption due to new urbanized areas, commercial areas, industrial areas, infrastructures, mining areas, landfills increased by 74% compared to thirty years ago, especially in the timeframe between 1994 and 2003), the Plan and its SEA explicitly reject the past developing model, and its consequent negative effects, such as the urban sprawl generated, that caused an exponential increase of public costs for infrastructures and management of the services needed. One of the clear objectives of the Plan addresses the limitation of land consumption: “it is possible to consume new land only if there is no alternative deriving from the substitution of existing urbanized texture, or from its re-organization, re-zoning or regeneration”. However, no target is fixed, due also to the fact that Italy, unlike most European countries, does not have a hi

N2  - Sediments can act as a major pollutant reservoir for heavy metals that will often bioaccumulate through the food chain. To determine background concentrations of heavy metals in marine sediments, as well as sediment size distribution and percent organic content, samples were collected from Cook’s Bay, Mo’orea, French Polynesia. Sediment traps were placed in the east side of Cook’s Bay and collected weekly. Samples were then decanted, filtered, and dried. They were analyzed for heavy metal content using Inductively Coupled Plasma Emission Spectrometry (ICP). Sediment size distribution was determined using Stoke’s Law, and percent carbon was measured using a muffle furnace. Enrichment factors were determined for elements with high average concentrations to determine excess input of these elements into Cook’s Bay. Aluminum, iron, magnesium, nickel, and silicon negatively correlated with distance from the freshwater inlet as originally hypothesized. Sediment size and percent carbon did not correlate with distance from the freshwater inlet as hypothesized. According to enrichment factors, aluminum, iron, manganese, and silicon are lithogenous in origin while it is unclear whether nickel and sulfur are anthropogenic in origin. Overall heavy metal and elemental contamination is low in Cook’s Bay, but it should be monitored in the future with the advent of increasing agriculture and housing development. Introduction A distinguishing characteristic of volcanic islands is their extreme susceptibility to disturbance (Fosberg 1963). These include natural disturbances such as cyclones and erosion, but also anthropogenic stresses. Evidence from Hawaii, New Zealand, Easter Island, Mangaia, Tikopia, Aneityum, and Fiji reveal pre-historic human impacts including deforestation, erosion and alluvial extension of coastal plains, and faunal depletion (especially endemic species) (Hughes, et al. 1979). In addition, human cultivation of land for agriculture can also cause disturbances to natural vegetation and composition of soils. Agriculture may be disruptive by releasing toxic chemical byproducts and causing land degradation and loss of vegetative matter. The loss of vegetation that binds soils increases sediment loading into streams, estuarine, and marine environments (London and Tucker 1992). Sedimentation is an increase in the thickness of a sediment body caused by the addition of material from a plume or run-off from the land at a body of water’s upper surface (Larcome and Woolfe 1999). Sedimentation can cause severe damage to marine ecosystems by reducing light availability for photosynthesis of algal and coral species. In addition, sediments can act as a major pollutant reservoir because metals and other contaminants can bind to the sediments and become bioavailable to the rest of the food chain (London and Tucker 1992). Several organisms such as filter feeders take in low levels of heavy metals which then bioaccumulate through the food chain. Bioaccumulation is the accumulation of food contaminant by oral uptake and digestion (Streit 1998). Heavy metals, in particular, have a high affinity for fine sediment particles. Most fine sediment particles are discharged by rivers and transported into the sea by means of small particulate matter (Palanques et al. 1995). These are highly concentrated in surface and near bottom turbid layers of the ocean. High concentrations of heavy metals have also been correlated with a higher content of organic matter (Palanques et al. 1995). The sources of heavy metal contamination vary from natural abundance in volcanic basalts to contamination from non-point sources of pollution. Lead and cadmium are mainly distributed to the environment from airborne chemicals that are natural and man-made (such as fossil fuel burning), industrial airborne chemicals, auto exhausts, intensive agriculture, and forestry. Cadmium, zinc, copper, and nickel are used in several fertilizers, fungicides, and pesticides used mainly for the sugarcane and pineapple industries (McMurtry et al. 1995). Lead is found in areas near roadways where unleaded fuel is used. A significant amount of total lead present in surface waters exists as suspended matter. Previous studies have found extremely large quantities of fine sediment (clay particles) in Cook’s Bay, Mo’orea, French Polynesia. Clay particles are more likely to be found in areas downstream of exposed topsoil such as is the case in the Pao Pao Watershed (Cox 1964). The area encompassing the Cook’s Bay watershed contains Pao Pao Valley and Pao Pao River that runs fresh water directly into the marine environment of the bay. Agriculture, housing, and roads are the main form of development, and the pineapple plantations in Pao Pao Valley are the main constituents of agriculture within the watershed. These pineapple plantations make use of frequent ditches for drainage and lack significant ground cover. London and Tucker (1992) proposed that these ditches increase the rate that water flows through the valley and into the marine environment. If these ditches were absent, water would flow overland or as subsurface flow to the stream. In addition, the lack of ground cover in the fields contributes to a significant sediment plume created in Cook’s Bay during heavy rainfall. The current concentrations of heavy metals, the types of heavy metals, and the presence of various elements that may be present in the existing sediment entering Cook’s Bay are unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine background concentrations of heavy metals and elements found in sediments of Cook’s Bay, as well as to determine whether they are antropogenically introduced. In addition, this study will analyze sediment size and percent organic (carbon) content. Hypotheses are 1) higher concentrations of heavy metals will be found in sediments closer to the inlet of freshwater, 2) elements present in high concentrations will be anthropogenic in origin, 3) larger sediment sizes will be found closer to the inlet of freshwater, and 4) a higher percent of carbon (organic matter) will be found closer to the inlet of freshwater. Materials and Methods Study Site Spot sampling was completed within coral reefs of Cook’s Bay, and at the east back reef near the barrier reef in Mo’orea, French Polynesia. Mo'orea is a volcanic island, the second youngest island in the Society Archipelago, and it is located in the Eastern Pacific at 17 ̊ S and 149 ̊ W (see Figure 1). Steep volcanic mountains surround Cook’s Bay on all sides, and there is a valley at the south end of the bay. Several agricultural fields consisting of pineapple plantations are scattered within the valley and Pao Pao River runs through the valley into the bay. During heavy rains (starting in November and ending approximately around April), a sediment plume develops that causes a huge influx of sediment particles into the bay (London and Tucker 1992). At the time this study was conducted (October and November of 2002), there was an extensive dry spell that lasted until the last week of the experiment (November 11-17). Because Mo’orea is a volcanic island, there are several different types of glassy basalts, and porphyritic oceanites and ankaramites. Many of the porphyritic types can be found along the shores of Cook’s Bay. Several metals and elements exist within the lavas and oceanites found naturally on Mo’orea. These include silica, aluminum, iron, magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, tin, phosphorus, and manganese (Williams 1933). Collection Methods Sediment samples were collected in Cook’s Bay starting near the entrance of the freshwater source out to the back reef (see Figure 2). Ten sediment traps were made and placed at five sites along the east side of Cook’s Bay. The spot testing took place on the east side of Cook’s Bay due to the presence of the coral reef structure that extends along that side of the bay as opposed to the west side which has no coral in addition to a steep drop-off. Two sediment traps were located at each spot within the bay and south of a colony of Porites. The sediment traps were left out for a week and then the sediment was collected. The traps were made using PVC piping with a height:diameter ratio of 5. According to Hargrave and Burns (1979), this is the best method to collect sediment in a turbulent area without resuspension of sediments within the traps (see Figure 3). The pipes were placed in plastic flowerpots and wet mixed cement was placed around them. The traps were placed in an air-conditioned room to be dried overnight. The traps were placed randomly at each of the five

N2  - This volume is divided into three discussions. The first is the examination of the determinants of health in central and eastern Europe and contributions from history the physical environment the economy life styles and the social and political environment. The second part evaluates health exposure to harmful environmental conditions from mining poor town planning lead air pollution arsenic in drinking water microbiologically contaminated water food contaminants unique problems and concerns where data is lacking. The final discussion addresses environmental actions investments and the need for remediation-oriented health data. The evidence suggests that environmental pollution is one of a number of competing determinants of health including shortcomings in medical care and life style factors such as smoking diet and exercise. Data from 12 countries in central and eastern Europe are used to identify specific locations and the nature of the environmental problem. The countries include Bulgaria the Czech Republic Slovakia Hungary Poland Romania Estonia Latvia Lithuania Belarus western Russia and the Ukraine. The most common health problems pertain to lead in the air and soil and neurobehavioral dysfunction air-born dust and respiratory conditions sulfur dioxide and other gases nitrates in drinking water contaminants in food and contaminants in water. Drinking water is contaminated by inappropriate fertilizer application improperly located rural septic tanks feed lots and agricultural businesses. Contamination also occurs from inappropriate disposal of water contaminated with arsenic viruses or bacteria pesticides radionuclides and chlorinated organic compounds. Inappropriate handling or disposal of lead dust heavy metals pesticides polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated organics such as PCBs affect the toxicity of foods. Public investment will be required to speed up the process of environmental improvement and to address persistent environmental problems. Priorities are investment in dust collection systems emission reduction replacement of coal as fuel and proper disposal of manures and domestic septic waste.

N2  - Historically, chemicals exceeding maximum allowable exposure levels have been disastrous to underdeveloped countries. The global food industry is primarily affected by toxic chemical substances because of natural and anthropogenic factors. Food safety is therefore threatened due to contamination by chemicals throughout the various stages of food production. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in the form of pesticides and other chemical substances such as Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) have a widely documented negative impact due to their long-lasting effect on the environment. This present review focuses on the chemical contamination pathways along the various stages of food production until the food reaches the consumer. The contamination of food can stem from various sources such as the agricultural sector and pollution from industrialized regions through the air, water, and soil. Therefore, it is imperative to control the application of chemicals during food packaging, the application of pesticides, and antibiotics in the food industry to prevent undesired residues on foodstuffs. Ultimately, the protection of consumers from food-related chemical toxicity depends on stringent efforts from regulatory authorities both in developed and underdeveloped nations.

N2  - Abstract Healthy soil is foundational to human health. Healthy soil is needed to grow crops, provides food, and sustains populations. It supports diverse ecosystems and critical ecological services such as pollination. It stores water and prevents floods. It captures carbon and slows global climate change. Soil pollution is a great and growing threat to human health. Soil may be polluted by heavy metals, organic chemicals such as pesticides, biological pathogens, and micro/nanoplastic particles. Pollution reduces soil’s ability to yield food. It results in food crop contamination and disease. Soil pollutants wash into rivers causing water pollution. Deforestation causes soil erosion, liberates sequestered pollutants, and generates airborne dust. Pollution of air, water, and soil is responsible for at least 9 million deaths each year. More than 60% of pollution-related disease and death is due to cardiovascular disease. Recognizing the importance of pollution to human health, the European Commission and the EU Action Plan for 2050: A Healthy Planet for All, have determined that air, water, and soil pollution must be reduced to levels that cause no harm to human or ecosystem health. We are thus required to create a toxic-free environment, respect the concept of a safe operating space for humanity, and sustain the health of our planet for future generations. This review article summarizes current knowledge of the links between soil health and human health and discusses the more important soil pollutants and their health effects.

N2  - ISSN 1758-3004 DOI 10.4155/CMT.11.51 © 2011 Future Science Ltd Modern agriculture has been hugely successful in meeting global demand for food, fiber and feed, and has recently made impressive strides in the production of liquid transportation fuels. Agriculture productivity was achieved through a vast transformation of the Earth’s surface on 15 million km of cropland and 28 million km of pasture [1]. This change in land-use has resulted in impacts on a global-scale to ecosystem structure and function, including reductions in critical ecosystem services that moderate climate, air pollution, water contamination and soil degradation. New constraints may amplify these impacts as the agriculture system confronts rising production costs, accelerating climate change and increasing scarcity of natural resources. An emerging response to the diverse impacts from the agriculture system has been to turn to ecologically sound agriculture practices that may enhance environmental quality, while also improving social and economic sustainability [2]. Conservation tillage, cover cropping, intercropping and integrated pest management are among the many strategies employed. One underlying theme in developing the scientific basis and design of these agroecological practices is the biotic interactions that determine agroecosystem function [3]. Managing biotic interactions in farm systems may reduce or eliminate the need for the very external inputs, which drive pollution, land degradation and the loss of biodiversity. Global adoption of such low-input practices has risen dramatically owing to new market opportunities for organic foods, as well as government incentives and mandates [4]. Agroecological approaches to farming represent a transformative change to many existing agriculture systems. Such a dramatic shift in agriculture practices may incur tradeoffs. One tradeoff highlighted in recent work is the potential for low-input agricultural systems to result in greater GHG emissions than the farming systems that they replace [5]. The climate change dimension of agriculture sustainability is of great concern since on-farm GHG emissions are currently 5.1–6.1 billion tons CO 2 -equivalents y, which is 10–12% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions [6]. In addition to onfarm emissions, agriculture is responsible for significant emissions in other categories reported in GHG inventories including deforestation, as well as industrial and energy sectors through the production of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, machinery and electricity.

N2  - The aim of this study was to determine the accumulation level of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu) in the tissues of some vegetable species taken from industrially polluted areas. The presence of heavy metals in vegetable and fruit products, with all the economic implications, regarding especially the health ones, is currently dealt with by the specialists in the area and the control authorities. The polluting sources by heavy metals of food products are: the use of irrigation, residual polluted water, treatments by pesticides, insecticides, fertilizers; pollution of atmosphere (in industrial areas, non-ferrous metal processing areas, intense traffic areas (tetraethyl lead from gasoline released into the atmosphere), mining areas and non-ferrous metals processing areas as well as accidental sources (releases of chemical substances into air, water, soil). The vegetables were cropped from polluted and unpolluted areas in Romania. Vegetable species largely used in preparing ranges of cans, either industrially or homemade, have been analyzed: tomatoes and leafy vegetables (spinach, orach) in order to study the changes occurring in heavy metal content of these raw materials during the processing operations. The accumulation potential of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, copper, zinc) in species of leafy vegetables varies as follows: spinach > orach. It is obvious that the accumulation potential of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, copper, and zinc) of vegetable species varies in their different anatomic parts as follows: leaves > petiole > stem > root > fruit. The increase of heavy metals level has the following effects: decrease of nitrogen monoxide level, a compound known under the name of “endothelial relaxing factor” in the walls of coronial arteries, without this substance the blood normal circulation is braked, increasing the risk of vascular blockage; reduction of hormones quantity produced by adrenal glands, leading to precocious ageing, the stress decreases sexual energy and aggravates the menopause symptoms; lack of any reaction of diabetics’ to medication; appearance of neurological diseases, such as depression and decrease of intellectual capacity; aggravation of osteoporosis and hypothyroidism.

Y1  - 1982///
N2  - Increased world population is exerting greater pressures on the earths resources; if the developing worlds population continues to grow by 2.1-2.2%/year available food supplies then must rise by at least 4% annually. While industrial and agricultural development have caused numerous environmental problems such as air water and soil pollution these problems are also caused by underdevelopment. Discussed are changes in the environment since the 1970s. Airborne emissions (sulphur and nitrogen oxides) and carbon dioxide concentrations increased since 1970 while the depletion of stratospheric ozone which will eventually be depleted by 10% in 2050 occurred. Marine pollution caused fouled beaches and localized contamination and many people had no access to clean water. In developing countries urban populations with access to safe water rose from 67% in 1970 to 77% in 1975 and declined to 75% in 1980; rural populations went from 11% in 1970 to 13% in 1980. In general the absolute number of people without water increased. Land and soil stability has been jeopardized by development as well. In developed countries alone more than 3 million hectares of productive land has been given over to settlement and roads. Erosion salinization alkalinization and chemical degradation have occurred worldwide--annual land degradation was assessed at 20 million hectares in 1980 threatening 600-700 million people. World urban population increased from 37.5% in 1970 to 41.3% in 1980 and by 1980 22 cities in developing countries had 4 million population each as opposed to only 16 cities in developed areas. Some 5 million children in developing countries died each year during the 1970s due to diphtheria pertussis whooping cough tetanus measles poliomyelitis and tuberculosis. In developed areas the impact on health by chemical pollutants has caused concern. Food shortages continued as well. Use of pesticides grew in the 1970s and there was a slowdown in industrial production. Overall costs of pollution-control measures ranged from 0.75-2.0% of the GNP. Between 1970-79 world energy consumption rose by 34% compared to a 58% increase in the 1960s and nuclear generation in 1979 provided 7.6% of world electrical power in OECD countries and 2.4% in developing countries. Use of solar systems wood-burning charcoal and biogas were on the rise as well. Scarcity of natural resources necessity for conservation and environment-development problems have grown as concerns during the last decade with many public organizations moving to affect decision making. International cooperation is needed if any improvement in the quality of life is to come about especially with the growing military expenditures and the accompanying waste of financial and human resources.

N2  - Abstract The global pesticide market has grown steadily since the 1940s, with the agricultural sector being the largest user of pesticides. The effect of pesticides on human health is manifested either through direct exposure to the material or indirect exposure to contaminated resources. Farmers and those dwelling near areas where pesticides are used may suffer from direct exposure, while the general population might be exposed indirectly, for example, by drinking contaminated water. Exposure to pesticides may cause a variety of symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, and vomiting, damage the nervous system, and even cause death. The risks involved in pesticide use include air pollution and soil and water contamination. The environmental implications of pesticide use include development of resistance among pests, a decline in biodiversity, interruption of the food chain, and disruption of the ecological balance. Pesticide use may also cause changes in physical parameters of the ecosystem. Effective activity of pesticides requires reaching proper leaf coverage. To prevent pest attacks due to insufficient leaf coverage, farmers tend to apply pesticides in excess. In view of the environmental and health implications of pesticide use, there is a clear need to limit pesticide application. Yet farmers lack the means to perform real-time in situ assessment of leaf coverage. Existing pesticide detection methods are complex, time-consuming, and unsuited to field application. Optical methods have the potential to provide quick assessments and can be used in situ. Several optical methods for detection of pesticides in general and on leaves in particular were developed. The findings indicated that the main problems in pesticide detection using fluorescence are the low autofluorescence of the pesticides and the nonreproducible spectral response of the leaves. These obstacles were solved by employing labeling agents. For example, rhodamine was suggested, mainly due to its excellent surface adhesion and its extremely high fluorescence quantum yield. The labeling agents were sprayed on leaves in the form of aerosols, thus creating a uniform layer of nanocrystals and microcrystals on the surface of the leaves. The effects of pesticides on the spectral characteristics of the labeling agents were examined using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy. When pesticide droplets were applied to a pretreated leaf, two phenomena were observed. The first was a substantial fluorescence increase. The second was material-specific spectral shifting as a result of interaction between the labeling molecules and organic components in the pesticide droplet. It was possible to utilize these spectral shifts for quantification of the pesticide concentration in the droplet. These spectral shifts enabled detection of pesticides on plants, although they were not sufficient for providing quantitative information on the extent of pesticide coverage. To detect pesticide coverage, several imaging data techniques were applied, such as LIF scanning of the examined plant surface. This method revealed the droplet shape by scanning and recording the fluorescence intensity at many points on a grid. Since application of this method is expensive and time-consuming, a second technique was also developed: it requires only a UV source and a CCD camera and it enables direct imaging of the pesticides on plants. The data obtained included the droplet shape and its location on the plant. When pesticide identification was required, application of a special hyperspectral fluorescence imaging method was introduced. Fourier transform hyperspectral imaging analysis provided simultaneous full spectral resolution at each pixel, enabling identification of the pesticide and its mapping on the plant. In practice, test plants have to be pretreated with labeling material before pesticide application. The changes in the labeling compound fluorescence can then be used for detection of the pesticide on the plant and quantification of the overall coverage. Low-cost mapping of the pesticide microdroplets could be obtained using a CCD camera, while accurate information could be based on Fourier transform hyperspectral imaging. Since these methods provide immediate results, they may allow the farmer to estimate leaf coverage during pesticide application and adjust spraying accordingly.

N2  - The development and application of new technologies in all spheres of life and work carries with it the ever-increasing pollution of the environment through harmful and toxic substances. Pesticides and heavy metals are among some of the more prominent pollutants of the environment. Heavy metals significantly contribute to human environment pollution due to the impossibility of their biodegradation, and because some of them have cumulative toxic properties. Sources of contamination by means of metals are numerous, the most important ones being combustion products in the chemical industry and metallurgy, industrial waste waters and landfills, agrochemicals, and exhaust gasses of motor vehicles. People are, therefore, exposed to toxic metals that act both directly through the contaminated air and drinking water, and indirectly through the soil, underground waters and poisoned plants and animals found in food, the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. Copper and zinc are essential bioelements which, in addition to their biological role and their importance for the development of the human body, also have a toxic effect when found in amounts higher than normal in the human body. Lead and cadmium are highly toxic metals, even when found only in traces (Goyer, 1997; Goyer & Klaassen, 1995). Copper is one of the essential biometals necessary for the growth, development and normal functioning of the human body, for the synthesis of hemoglobin, melanin, and the mineralization and development of bones. The lack of copper can lead to serious illnesses. Nevertheless, its presence in the human body in values greater than 10-6 mol/dm3 inhibits certain enzymes, which hinders the bonding of other essential microelements, or even leads to bonding with certain cofactors. The increased content of copper in the human body leads to coronary and vascular disease, arteriosclerosis, hypertension and various forms of damage to the central nervous system (Uauy, et al., 1998; Hart, et al. 1928; Chapman, 2008). Zinc is an essential oligoelement which is found in significant amounts in the human body (0.02 – 0.03 g/kg of body weight). It is necessary for the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids, DNA replication, the human reproductive ability, and maintaining high level healthy immune function. A shortage of zinc in the human body can lead to the harmful effect of

N2  - Recent water quality inventories show that agricultural non-point source pollution (NPS) is the leading source of water quality impacts to surveyed rivers and lakes, and also a major contributor to groundwater contamination and wetlands degradation (Blankenberg et al. 2006; Haarstad and Braskerud 2005; Bergstrom 2004; Thiere and Schulz 2004; Schreiber et al. 2001; Huber et al. 2000; Luo and Zhang 2010). Pest management is one of the main scopes of pesticides usage, because more than 45% of annual food production is lost due to pest infestation. In particular, at tropical climates this is enhanced due to prevailing high temperature and humidity. However, the sporadic use has been leading to significant consequences not only to public health but also to food quality resulting in an impact load on the environment and hence the development of pest resistance (Giupponi and Rosato 1999; Luo and Zhang 2010) Through overuse, misuse and losses due to the inappropriate application of pesticides there is considerable waste contributing to the environmental burden (Li et al. 2006; Giupponi and Rosato 1999; Hu et al. 2010; Marco and Kishimba 2007; Luo and Zhang 2010). It is well known that most of the applied pesticides are subject to many transport and conversion processes. Thus, they do not remain at their target site but often enter aquatic environments via soil percolation, air drift or surface run-off, affecting abundance and diversity of nontarget species, producing complex effects on the ecosystems and, altering trophic interactions (Islam and Tanaka, 2004). Pesticides overuse also destroys the healthy pool of bio-control agents that normally co-exist with the vegetation. Simultaneously, some soil biological functions such as the bioavailability of nutrients and organic matter decomposition could also be altered (Hendrix 1996; Guo et al. 2009). For instance, the herbicides can influence soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and metabolic quotient (qCO), variables directly related to soil quality (Reis et al. 2009). In addition, agrochemical application on soybean shoots affects the activity of soil microorganisms in the plant rhizosphere (Reis et al. 2009). The bulk of pesticides worldwide used is herbicides and there is almost no knowledge of their impact on potential non-target plant species, especially rare or endemic species

N2  - Background: Information on cancer causation has come from investigation of the patterns of cancer in human populations and the induction of tumours in experimental animals following treatment with cancer-causing agents. It has been proven that genetic susceptibility may significantly alter the risk from environmental exposures. The most important human carcinogens include tobacco, asbestos, aflatoxins and ultraviolet light. Almost 20 % of cancers are associated with chronic infections, the most significant ones being hepatitis viruses (HBV, HCV), papillomaviruses (HPV) and Helicobacter pylori. Pollution of air, water and soil is estimated to account for 4–7 % of all cancers in developed world. A small proportion of lung cancer (< 5 %) is attributable to outdoor air pollution by industrial effluent, engine exhaust products and other toxins. Chlorofluorocarbons cause destruction of the ozone layer and enhance the risk of skin cancer through increased ultraviolet radiation. Contamination of drinking water is not a general carcinogenic hazard, but high levels of arsenic and chlorination by-products in some communities carry a risk. Food may be contaminated by natural or man-made toxins, including substances shown to be carcinogenic in experimental animals and, in some cases, in humans. Naturallyoccurring carcinogens include mycotoxins, particularly aflatoxins, which contribute to causation of liver cancer. Food can be contaminated by residual pesticides. Conclusions: Means to reduce and, in some cases, eliminate risk of cancer include elimination of carcinogenic factor (asbestos) enforced by regulation and reduction of exposure or use of preventive and prophylactic measures (Hepatitis B, HPV vaccination, avoiding of sun).

N2  - Rocket is traditionally cultivated in soil and commercialized either as fresh or as ready-to-eat produce. This leafy vegetable is often commercialized fresh, cut, washed, conditioned in packages as ready-to-eat food, giving added-value to the fresh products. Soilless culture system (SCS) allows to control growth factors and clean leaf production, easing and shortening postharvest handling in process industries. A comparison between the traditional culture system (TCS) and a SCS was effected, with two plant densities (1067 and 2134 plants/m). TCS was simulated in polystyrene trays filled with local soil and peat (1:1 v/v), overhead irrigation and weekly fertilization. For SCS 40cell trays were filled with 1:1 perlite and peat, seeded and floated in a nutrient solution during plant growth. Fresh leaf production was significantly influenced by culture system x plant density. Rocket grown with SCS produced about 75% more than plants grown with TCS. The plants grown in SCS with the highest plant density gave the greatest production (2182 g m). Nitrate leaf content was significantly influenced by the culture systems. The leaves of plants grown with TCS contained less NO3 than those grown with SCS, in a ratio of 1:1.6. With both culture systems the nitrate content was much lower than 2500 mg kg f.w., which is the maximum content allowed by EU regulation for lettuce. In this experiment SCS allowed to enhance earliness: in fact, SCS produced marketable and ready-to-eat rocket in 70 days, while TCS would require extended growing period. INTRODUCTION During the last decade fresh-cut vegetables have strongly increased their market all over Europe. Fresh-cut produce includes fresh vegetables, which present a high added-value because they are previously washed and cut, packaged and sealed in plastic containers, and marketed as ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook products. Recently, Italian consumers have emphasized the need for higher quality and tastier ready-to-eat vegetables. The revaluation of the Mediterranean diet and the development of the consumption of ready-to-eat vegetables led to the expansion of fresh herb market. Rocket is a popular leafy vegetable in Mediterranean countries and for the spicy hot taste of its leaves is mainly used to garnish and to flavour salads and a large variety of meals. As a consequence of the growing interest of consumers and producers, rocket crop production has increased, and soilless cultivation systems have been tested (Bianco, 1995; Hoeberechts et al., 2002; Nicola et al., 2003; Pimpini and Enzo, 1997a). Protected cultivation is nowadays shifting from Traditional Culture System (TCS) in soil to Soilless Culture System (SCS), based on growing media and fertigation system. The goals of this change are to obtain higher qualitative and quantitative yields, to standardize cultural techniques and to reduce both production costs and environmental impact. SCS represents a valid alternative to traditional cultivation techniques due to the full control of the inputs that it provides and it is a good technique to grow rocket offering guarantees of quality to the market. SCS allows to produce clean material at harvest, and consequently to reduce many washing treatments. In addition, the short growing cycle of the greenhouse-grown vegetables reduces chances of parasite attacks and disease spread throughout the crop, and using mineral and sterile media with a low environmental impact may be an alternative to the practice of soil disinfection. Optimizing all the food chain production is necessary to obtain the best raw material for the ready-to-eat sector. The SCS well meet part of this goal, since it requires special Proc. IS on Soilless Cult. and Hydroponics Ed: M. Urrestarazu Gavilán Acta Hort. 697 ISHS 2005 550 attention to all the environmental factors involved (light, air temperature, soil humidity, fertilizers, etc.) to allow high quality growth and timing of production. Among the factors that affect root growth and, consequently, shoot growth, nutrient solution, moisture and water content of the growing medium play an important role, and are particularly determined by the irrigation system used during production. Traditional irrigation systems include Overhead (OH) and Ebb-and-Flow (EF) irrigation, to which fertilizers are supplied in the water. OH irrigation system does not assure a uniform water flow throughout the medium and can induce drought stress to the roots, particularly during hot seasons (Nicola and Cantliffe, 1996a). The EF system may allow 50 to 60% reduction of pesticide use, 85% reduction of water use, 50% reduction of fertilizer use, elimination of groundwater contamination, and rare occurrence of foliar and soil-borne diseases (Thomas, 1993). Some authors (Vavrina and Hochmuth, 1996) showed how using a sub-irrigation system increases fertilizer application precision to the plants by reducing water leaching during irrigation. In Italy the Flotation (FL) irrigation system has also been introduced. The FL is similar to the EF system, but the trays continuously float on a water bed or nutrient solution (Nicola, 1993; Pimpini and Enzo, 1997b; Thomas, 1993). This production system presents relative low maintenance and labor costs and efficient use of water and greenhouse space (Galloway et al., 1996). Managing production of leafy vegetables includes to control plant nitrate content due to its indirect negative effects on human health. Nitrate is reduced in humans beings by salivary enzymes to nitrite (Duncan et al., 1997), which can either block oxygen transport in the blood, causing methaemoglobinaemia in infants, or form N-nitrous compounds and Nnitrosatable compounds, which are considered to cause cancer (Walker, 1990). Nitrate content in vegetables is regulated in the EU by Reg. 563/2002 for lettuce and spinach only, while for other vegetable products solely national limits are present in some EU countries. Rocket is classified among species with high nitrate content (>2500 mg kg f.w.): it accumulates nitrate even when there is little nitrate availability in the culture medium (Graifenberg et al., 1993; Schuddeboom, 1993; Santamaria, 1997; Santamaria et al., 2002). Regulations on rocket nitrate content thresholds should be foreseen and desirable. Studies on irrigation systems should be considered in interaction with the N fertilization and its effect on root morpho-physiology, thus on whole plant growth. When fertigation is employed, careful management of fertilizer content is important since large amounts of fertilizers can be applied when irrigation demands are high. This is of particular concern especially when subirrigation is employed. In subirrigation, if too much fertilizer is being applied, there is no overhead irrigation to leach the salts. Excessive fertilization could lead to negative consequences, for the environment, since large amounts of mineral nutrients, particularly N both in the nutrient solution and in the growing medium, can lead to nitrogen pollution in the water table and in the air (Smith et al., 1990). This fact is even more evident in open soilless growing system, which is the growing system still widely used for vegetable production. Negative consequences are to be expected also with respect to the plant system: excessive fertilization can result in excessive N applied, and consequently taken up, leading to a low Nitrogen Use Efficiency or to nitrate accumulation in the leaves. Controlling and managing nutrient solution in the SCS according to plant environmental needs allows decreasing nitrate content in the edible part of the plant. SCS is an efficient system to manage the nitrogen fertilization that allowed a low nitrate content in the edible parts of corn salad, rocket and radishes. In 2003 a nitrate level below 2000 mg kg f.w. was found in corn salad grown with 30 mmol L N in the nutrient solution with a subirrigation system (Fontana et al., 2003). The same authors in 2004 obtained a level of NO3 below 350 mg kg f.w. in the same species grown in SCS continuously fertigated with a nutrient solution of 10 mmol L (Fontana et al., 2004). In 2003 values <2500 mg kg f.w. NO3 were found in rocket salad grown in a SCS with Ebb-and-Flow irrigation system (Nicola et al., 2003). A lower nitrate content in radishes grown with a SCS than in radishes grown with a traditional soil culture system was found in 2004 (Nicola et al., 2004a). SCS vs TCS has not yet been evaluated for rocket salad, thus the objective of the present research was to compare TCS and SCS to produce rocket for fresh-cut market of high quality in terms of production and low nitrate content.

T1  - Environmental Fate and Analysis of Insecticidal Fumigant Residues in Stored Grain and Grain-Based Products
A1  - Ntayiah, Rhonest
Y1  - 1992///
N2  - The work described in this thesis is principally concerned with the environmental fate and analysis of halogenated hydrocarbons commonly used as insecticidal fumigants on stored grains and their by-products. The fumigation of stored products with these volatile compounds, which has been a common practice for centuries, is designed to destroy insects infesting the food and the storage area. The fumigated grains are normally used as food for human and animal consumption. The chemicals applied on them are highly toxic and are environmental hazards. There has been consistent evidence that some of these chemicals remain associated with foodstuffs as residues for a long period after treatment and therefore become a potential risk to human beings and the environment as a whole. Environmental pollution, an increasing threat to the world, is often not directly perceptible and therefore its protection has become a major goal all over the world. In attempting to predict the fate of fumigants in cereal grains, a full understanding of how the many parameters may influence the physical or chemical interaction of fumigants with grains or other food commodities and the ability to detect and determine the residues remaining in such food is essential to understanding their impact upon the environment. The effective use of these pesticides and the control of their contamination of the food supply and the environment, depends heavily on the ability to detect, identify and quantify them, often in very low concentrations. Analytical methods have been developed for the detection of fumigants as residues on fumigated food products or in the environment. The work carried out here is basically a description of an attempt to meet the main objectives of the research project discussed in Chapter One, namely; 1) critical literature review on modern fumigants and methods of fumigation, 2) environmental fate and reaction of these fumigants with the constituents of foodstuffs, and 3) development of a method or methods for fumigant residues or multiresidue analysis. Chapter Two describes a comprehensive review of the existing literature pertaining to important fumigants and their method fo application with special reference to maize and wheat grains and their by-products. The study which was carried out during the first part of the research, revealed that only about six insecticidal fumigants are currently in use largely in tropical countries. Environmental fate discussed in Chapter Three illustrated that the fumigants used for fumigation in storage are not only a public health hazard to those directly involved in fumigation or other related occupations but also those beyond the fumigation and storage premises. These chemicals have been detected in the air, water and soil especially around the fumigation area and therefore a great need for their monitoring and detection in the environment. Chapter Four deals exclusively with developments of methods that are specifically suitable for single fumigant residues. Three analytical methods with high precision and good overall recoveries were developed which allowed the determination of such a volatile fumigant as methyl bromide in very low concentrations. With the help of other improved parameters such as the electron capture detector, the capillary column and the tenax adsorbent trap, efficient and sensitive detection with good reproducibility and high recoveries was observed (Chapter Five). Chapter Six describes the advantages and disadvantages of fumigant residues methodology and evaluation assessment and compares its effectiveness with other available methods. The underlying fact revealed that a more broad and integrated method of assessment which utilises all effective methods is advisable. Finally, Chapter Seven concludes the findings, with recommendations for further vigilance and monitoring of the fumigant residues in the food supply and the environment. This suggests that, for any meaningful reduction in the risk from these chemicals and to check that internationally recommended maximum residue levels are fully adhered to, determination of fumigant residues is essential before any treated commodity is consumed by humans or animals.

T1  - Enfoque multianalítico para evaluar la contaminación por plomo en suelos / multianalytical approach to assess the soil contamination by lead
A1  - Seijo, Andrés Rodríguez
Y1  - 2016///
N2  - Soil is the unconsolidated top layer of the earth crust that develops on the surface of the rocks due to their physical alteration, chemistry and influence climate, topography, organisms and time. It is a living system and its existence and conservation are due to the dynamics and ecological balances of the large number of living beings that inhabit it; influencing plant growth and development. This is because many processes of food energy transfer (through soil organisms) take place. Each one feeds on the foregoing and, in turn, feeds the next. Soils are exposed to a natural and/or anthropogenic set of pressures and degradation processes that affect their physical, chemical and biological properties. The soil is a finite resource, which implies that its loss and degradation are not reversible, even in the long term. It is under increasing pressure due to intensified agricultural, forestry, pastoral and urban development purposes, as well as satisfying food, energy and raw material production demands, and because of its use as a support for certain activities that may contaminate it, such as military or sport shooting. A soil can be degraded by accumulating potentially hazardous elements (PHEs) to levels that adversely affect its behaviour. Such elements, at these concentration levels, are toxic to soil organisms. It is a chemical degradation that causes partial or total loss of soil productivity. Soil contamination with PHEs is alarming because many of them are toxic to organisms and they can get into the food web producing harmful effects on humans. They come from different industrial, urban and agricultural sources, and are often found together in contaminated sites. In contamination studies, it is not sufficient to detect the presence of contaminants, but it is necessary to define the maximum levels and also analyse the possible factors that can influence the soil response to pollutants. Lead is an element that can produce very harmful effects if it reaches the food web. It is a heavy metal that forms many salts, oxides and organometallic compounds. Its most important minerals are galena (PbS), cerussite (PbCO3), crocoite (PbCrO4) and pyromorphite (Pb5 (PO4)3Cl), although it is also found in various uranium and thorium minerals as they come directly from radioactive disintegration. It is used in the production of accumulators, batteries, pigments, pesticides, explosives, chemical reagents, solders, anti-knock additives for petrol (now banned in many countries), pottery, covers for protection against X-rays, pipes, projectiles, etc. It is a serious pollutant of the atmosphere, hydrosphere and edaphosphere. The addition of Pb to petrol causes an unnatural cycle of this metal. It is burned in car engines, thus generating Pb salts (chlorides, bromides, oxides) that enter the environment through the exhaust pipes. The large particles fall into soil or water, and the small ones travel long distances through the air and remain in the atmosphere. Some of these then fall with rain. Therefore, the Pb cycle, due to anthropic activity, is much more widespread than the natural cycle, causing pollution. Lead reaches soil from industrial and mining waste, atmospheric deposition, military activities and from bedrock, if it is rich in minerals containing this metal. Although it can be immobilized in organic matter and clay soil, if it is acid, or is acidified, Pb is mobile and can be absorbed by plants and through them it can reach animals and man. The low mobility causes the permanence of Pb in the surface horizons and therefore, it is not easily assimilated by plants in the same degree as other potentially toxic elements. Thus, soils are an important sink for lead compounds. It is necessary to consider that as Pb is more mobile in acid mediums, common in mining waste and landfill leachates, it can be released and get into the food web from these sources. In addition to acidity, mineralogy, texture and organic matter content, Pb availability also depends on the nature of the Pb compounds that reach the soil. If Pb is present in bioavailable form, it can be absorbed by the different components of the food web: modifying microbial activity; accumulating in invertebrates and the plant root system, and generating adverse effects on primary producers. Consequently, Pb and its compounds tend to be accumulated in soils and sediments, and part of this metal is in bioavailable form for a long period of time, so there is a risk of entry into the food web. In recent years, many efforts have been made to reduce the danger associated with Pb-contaminated soils, recognise contaminated sites and locate contamination sources, since they often come from diverse and highly dispersed sources. It is, therefore, necessary to deepen the knowledge of analytical techniques which determine the origin of Pb and establish its contents in different soils, as well as its availability and toxicity as accurately as possible, in order to propose measures to reduce its availability. Hence, this PhD Thesis was planned. In order to do so, affected areas were selected from various human activities that provide high levels of Pb from different origins to the environment. To evaluate its contents and availability in the soils from these areas, different analytical techniques were used. Those chosen were considered adequate for each zone, some of them relatively new, whose validity has been proven in previous studies. Therefore, different soils were selected from disturbed areas by anthropic activities, which introduce Pb and other potentially toxic elements and compounds into the soil. These soils were: i) those from an old Zn/Pb mine, located in Rubiais (Lugo, Spain); ii) the urban soils from parks and gardens located in the municipality of Vigo (Spain); iii) those from a small arms firing range and a trap shooting range (Monforte, Lugo, Spain) and iv) those from a military manoeuvers and shooting range (El Teleno, Astorga, Spain). All of this allowed us to determine, as accurately as possible, the Pb content and availability, and those of other potentially hazardous elements (PHEs) and compounds from each of these activities. Toxicity and ecological risks in the affected areas were also evaluated, and measures to reduce its content and availability were proposed. They were tested and applied different analytical techniques and the more appropriated were selected to evaluate with the highest accuracy and according to the area and the source of pollution: the contamination level of the soils of each one of the selected areas; the availability, the toxicity and the ecological risks. Finally, it was probed in selected soils the effectiveness of applying Ca3(PO4)2 nanoparticles to decrease the availability of the contaminants. The results obtained allowed to achieve the following conclusions: 1. In all of the selected areas, the different anthropic activities incorporate to the soils high levels of Pb and of other potentially hazardous elements and compounds that cause different degrees of contamination and toxicity. 2. The mine soils have high physical and chemical limitations for plant growth standing out the high contents of Pb and Zn that exceed the official thresholds for ecosystems and agricultural, urban and industrial uses. 3. The urban soils from the city of Vigo are moderately contaminated by Ba, Pb and Cu due to the influence of industrial areas and the main transport routes. 4. The use of the 206Pb/207Pb ratio have allowed to know that the both industrial and fuel emissions are the main sources of Pb in the urban soils from the city of Vigo. 5. The contamination of the soils from the small arm firing range comes from both the Pb ammunition and the steel one that releases Cr, Fe and Ni. 6. Lead is the main pollutant in the soils from the military shooting area followed by Sb, Cu, As, Ni and Cd. 7. The contents of Pb and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the soils from the trap shooting range exceed the generic levels of reference. 8. CaCl2 is the most efficient reactant for extracting potentially toxic elements and the one that better reflects the available content. 9. Regardless, the source of the contamination, the soils with highest contents of potentially toxic elements lack vegetation. The presence of Agrostis capillaris in the soils from the trap shooting range and of Cytisus scoparius and Betula celtiberica in the mine soils favors the phytostabilization. 10. The combined use of MC-ICP-MS and TOF-SIMS allows studying the interaction between the soil components and the Pb isotopes and identifying the anthropic of geogenic origin of this element. 11. The chemical analysis of the total and available content together with the use of TEM-EDS and TOF-SIMS is the methodology that provides the best information about the interactions between the potentially toxic elements and the soil components and about their possible toxicity, therefore about their availability in a short, medium or long term. 12. The adverse effects identified in Eisenia andrei individuals after the toxicological experiments indicate that the habitat soil function is affected mainly due to the Pb contents. 13. The application to the soils of Ca3(PO4)2 nanoparticles reduces up to 90% the available contents of Pb and Cu due to adsorption processes. 14. In order to select the suitable treatment and dosages for the soils recovery, it is compulsory to carry out more and deeper studies to understand the different nanomaterials capacities for immobilizing the contaminants and the possibility that they cause toxic effects in the soils. 15. More research is needed to be able to determine the available content of each element in each soil. This information together with the one obtained in this work will favor the evaluation and the improvement of the quality of contaminated soils.

N2  - The global pesticide market has grown steadily since the 1940s, with the agricultural sector being the largest user of pesticides. The effect of pesticides on human health is manifested either through direct exposure to the material or indirect exposure to contaminated resources. Farmers and those dwelling near areas where pesticides are used may suffer from direct exposure, while the general population might be exposed indirectly, for example, by drinking contaminated water. Exposure to pesticides may cause a variety of symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, and vomiting, damage the nervous system, and even cause death. The risks involved in pesticide use include air pollution and soil and water contamination. The environmental implications of pesticide use include development of resistance among pests, a decline in biodiversity, interruption of the food chain, and disruption of the ecological balance. Pesticide use may also cause changes in physical parameters of the ecosystem. Effective activity of pesticides requires reaching proper leaf coverage. To prevent pest attacks due to insuffi cient leaf coverage, farmers tend to apply pesticides in excess. In view of the environmental and health implications of pesticide use, there is a clear need to limit pesticide application. Yet farmers lack the means to perform real-time in situ assessment of leaf coverage. Existing pesticide detection methods are complex, time-consuming, and unsuited to fi eld application. Optical methods have the potential to provide quick assessments and can be used in situ . Several optical methods for detection of pesticides in general and on leaves in particular were developed. The fi ndings indicated that the main problems in pesticide detection using fl uorescence are the low autofl uorescence of the pesticides and the nonreproducible spectral response of the leaves. These obstacles were solved by employing labeling agents. For example, rhodamine was suggested, mainly due to its excellent surface adhesion and its extremely high fl uorescence quantum yield. The labeling agents were sprayed on leaves in the form of aerosols, thus creating a uniform layer of nanocrystals and microcrystals on the surface of the leaves. The effects of pesticides on the spectral characteristics of the labeling agents were examined using laser-induced fl uorescence (LIF) spectroscopy. When pesticide droplets were applied to a pretreated leaf, two phenomena were observed. The fi rst was a substantial fl uorescence increase. The second was material-specifi c spectral shifting as a result of interaction between the labeling molecules and organic components in the pesticide droplet. It was possible to utilize these spectral shifts for quantifi cation of the pesticide concentration in the droplet. These spectral shifts enabled detection of pesticides on plants, although they were not suffi cient for providing quantitative information on the extent of pesticide coverage. To detect pesticide coverage, several imaging data techniques were applied, such as LIF scanning of the examined plant surface. This method revealed the droplet shape by scanning and recording the fl uorescence intensity at many points on a grid. Since application of this method is expensive and time-consuming, a second technique was also developed: it requires only a UV source and a CCD camera and it enables direct imaging of the pesticides on plants. The data obtained included the droplet shape and its location on the plant. When pesticide identifi cation was required, application of a special hyperspectral fl uorescence imaging method was introduced. Fourier transform hyperspectral imaging analysis provided simultaneous full spectral resolution at each pixel, enabling identifi cation of the pesticide and its mapping on the plant. In practice, test plants have to be pretreated with labeling material before pesticide application. The changes in the labeling compound fl uorescence can then be used for detection of the pesticide on the plant and quantifi cation of the overall coverage. Low-cost mapping of the pesticide microdroplets could be obtained using a CCD camera, while accurate information could be based on Fourier transform hyperspectral imaging. Since these methods provide immediate results, they may allow the farmer to estimate leaf coverage during pesticide application and adjust spraying accordingly.

T1  - TYPES OF ORGANISMS DECOMPOSERS OF SOIL POLLUTANTS Ika Karyaningsih
A1  - Karyaningsih, Ika
Y1  - 2018///
N2  - Pollutants will land declining soil quality and land productivity and lower the carrying capacity of land to humans and the environment. Various types of pollutants require certain types of soil organisms to decompose both microbes and soil fauna, so this paper focuses on identifying the types of decomposers in each pollutant. Soil microbes (bacteria) are more widely used for various types of pollutants while the soil fauna acts as a chunk of solid material which will then be broken down by microbes. 1. Preliminary Soil contamination is a condition of the entry of one or many chemical, physical, or biological objects into the soil where they can damage the soil structure and make the plant difficult to adapt. P pollution or pollution can be distinguished into pollution of soil, water, air, or from sound. P soil contamination is mostly caused by organic and inorganic waste coming from household waste, market, industry, agriculture activities, livestock and others there is easy to describe there is also garbage which is very difficult to decipher even take years. In the living soil various organisms (microorganisms and fauna) that perform various activities for the life of other living beings or with other words make the land possible for the continuation of natural beings . The microbiological population that inhabits the soil, along with various forms of animals and other higher-level plants forms a system of life that is not separate from mineral materials and the remaining organic material present in the soil. The quantitative composition of the population in the soil and the qualitative nature of the environment can be characterized as highly dependent on the source and natural conditions of the soil and the relative composition of the organic and inorganic elements. Decomposers are living things that serve to describe living things that have died or decompose waste materials so that the material described can be absorbed by plants that live around the area. But any waste or waste that exists in the environment have different structures and contents that will affect the organism that is able to decipher the material. Therefore this paper would like to answer what types of decomposers (decomposers) that can reduce the contaminants on the soil. Objectives to be achieved is to analyze the type of organisms both microbes and soil fauna for pennguraian contaminants soil. 2. Soil Pollutants Waste is waste / waste generated from a production process both industrial and domestic (household). While in the Act No. 18 of 2008 on Waste Management, it is mentioned that waste is the residual activity of human daily or natural process in the form of solid or semi-solid in the form of organic or inorganic substances are biodegradable or not biodegradable which is considered to be useless and discarded environment. Soil contamination occurs when waste is not disposed of properly or can occur when humans dispose of chemicals to the soil in the form of domestic, market and domestic waste, pesticides, insecticides and fertilizers in agricultural practices. Mineral exploitation (mining activities) has also contributed to the destruction of the land. Plastic wastes are made from synthetic materials, generally using petroleum as the base material, plus additional materials which are generally heavy metals (cadnium, lead, nickel) or other toxic materials such as Chlor. This plastic toxin is released when it breaks down or burns. Decomposition of the plastic will release various types of heavy metals and other chemicals it contains. These chemicals dissolve in water or are bonded to the ground, and then enter our bodies through food and drink. While plastic combustion produces one of the most dangerous materials in the world, namely Dioxin. Dioxin is one of the few chemicals that have been studied intensively and has been confirmed to cause cancer. The danger of dioxin is often paralleled with DDT, which has now been banned all over the world. In addition to dioxin, combustion ash also contains various heavy metals contained in the plastic. According to Darmono (1995), the factors that cause metal weight including in group substance contaminants is because existence properties metal weight that is not could decompose ( non degradable ) and easy absorbed . Organism The first affected effect addition pollutant metal weight to soil or other habitats is organism and plants that grow in soil or the habitat. In ecosystem natural there interaction between organism good interaction positive as well negatives that describe form of energy transfer between population in community the . With thereby influence metal weight the on finally will to on hierarchy chain food the highest that is human . Metals weight is known could gather in in body something organism and permanent stay in body for period long time as toxins that accumulate (Saeni, 1997). Soil contamination usually occurs due to: leakage of wastewater or industrial chemicals or commercial facilities; use of pesticides; the entry of contaminated surface water into the sub-surface layer; accidents of vehicles transporting oil, chemicals or waste; waste water from waste dumps and industrial waste directly disposed of in illegally dumped land . When a hazardous substance has polluted the soil surface, it can evaporate, be swept away by rainwater and or enter the soil. Pollution into the soil then settled as a toxic chemical on the ground. Toxic substances in the soil can have a direct impact on humans when in contact or can contaminate groundwater and air above it (Veegha, 2008) . Waste is discharged from a production process both industrial and domestic (household, better known as waste), whose presence at a certain time and place is not desired by the environment because it has no economic value. When viewed chemically, this waste consists of organic and inorganic chemicals. With certain concentrations and quantities, the presence of waste can have a negative impact on the environment, especially for human health, so it needs to be handled to waste. The level of danger of toxicity caused by the waste depends on the type and characteristics of the waste (Wikipedia, 2009). 3. Decomposition of Soil Pollutants 3.1. Decomposition of plastic materials Plastic is a waste that is mentioned can not decompose, is not environmentally friendly, and is the most dangerous and troublesome waste that is the main problem of handling the world's waste. Although it can decompose, the plastic takes up to thousands of years to break down. Japanese scientists studied the decomposition process of PET plastic (Poly ethylene tetra) , and found the bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis which uses two kinds of enzymes to crush the plastic into eco-friendly substances. Then the resultant substance destruction of PET plastic is used as a food source for the bacteria colony Ideonella sakaiensis . The bacteria use a carbon-containing decomposition agent for their growth. The bacterium takes 6 weeks to decompose low quality PET plastic. The optimum condition of this bacterium to decompose PET plastic is at a temperature of 30 0 C. Both of these enzymes are ISF6_4831 and ISF6_0224. They are professionally assigned, where the ISF6_4831 enzyme is assigned to decompose PET into simpler chemical elements, while the other, the ISF6_0224 enzyme is tasked with completing and refining the process. When the decomposition process is complete, the plastic can later be converted to carbon dioxide and water. These bacteria are able to consume PET (small size) in just six weeks if stored at a temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit, and the future will be developed so that these bacteria can consume in a larger mass. Mealworm or also called hongkong caterpillar / caterpillar flour which is usually used as food birds who step in it can mengura plastic garbage fish Styrofoam ( type of plastic from polystyrene material). Based on 2 studies from ch ina one of them Weimin Wu Environmental Engineering expert, Microbiology proves hongkong worms can eat plastic garbage Styrofoam . By providing 34-39 milligrams of styrofoam to hongkong worms, Styrofoam transformed into CO2 less than 24 hours is a very fast process. Tests In both studies Weimin Wu uses microbials in the digestive tract of hongkong caterpillars, where the microbes are able to decipher styrofoam even though the process is slow. Weimin Wu's research opens opportunities to solve plastic waste problems especially styrofoam, in the future Weimin Wu tries to look for hongkong caterpillar-like organisms in the sea, thus solving the waste problem at sea. Adam Gusse and colleagues from the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse then examined the benefits of fungi that usually live at the base of the rotting stem. This white fungus produces an enzyme that can break down the hard lignin layer. Lignin has a chemical structure similar to phenol resins because it is composed of bonded molecules. Gusse puts phenol resin flakes into five different mushroom species to compare his influence. The research team saw there was a species called Phanerochaete chrysosporium which changed its body color from white to pink after a few days. This suggests that the fungus has decomposed resins into smaller pink polymer molecules. They make sure the findings after feeding the mold with phenolic resin containing the heavier carbon isotopes h isilnya, isotopes are absorbed into the body of the fungus. 3.2. Decomposition of organic matter In the process of decomposition of organic materials of cellulolytic microbes secrete cellulose enzymes that play a role in accelerating the process of hydrolysis of cellulose and other polysaccharides. Decomposition of these materials will overhaul the physical properties of matter, and will release some nutrients, such as Nitrogen, Phosphat, Potassium, and Sulfur. Nutrient elements resulting from this decomposition process will be utilized by microorganisms to support their metabolism. T

N2  - Pesticides, if used as recommended, are generally expected to cause little adverse impact on the environment. However, it is evident that trace levels of pesticide residues present in soil, water, air, and sometimes food, may result in harmful effects on human and environmental health. Pesticides can pose health risks through several exposure pathways including direct occupational related exposure, through food, or through the residues present in the environment. This paper reviews available information on the nature and extent of pesticide contamination of Australian soils, surface water, and groundwaters. Published studies on the fate and behaviour of pesticides in Australian soils have also been reviewed, covering the key processes controlling the fate and behaviour of pesticides in soils, namely sorption-desorption, degradation (biological and abiotic), and volatilisation in soil and their off-site transport into surface and groundwaters. Some management options for minimising the diffuse source pollution of soils and waters by pesticides and remediation of contaminated soils and water have also been discussed. The review concludes that contamination of soils and water with pesticides has occurred in Australia and there is a need to understand the behaviour of pesticides in the soil environment in order to develop management practices to minimise any adverse impact on our environment in future.

T1  - TO THE PROBLEM ON PESTICIDE RESIDUES IN CROPS AND SOILS IN JAPAN
A1  - Yogo, Y

Y1  - 2009///
N2  - Pesticide residues adversely affect human health and the natural environment. In Japan, several pesticides were detected to exceed Maximum Residue Level (MRL) of foods. Its current pesticide registration system requires performing a set of acute toxicity examinations in three aquatic organisms. Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), most of which are “past pesticides,” have now become a global issue. The objective of this paper is to provide basic knowledge on pesticide exposure and what are the approaches used to deal with residue issues in Japan. Each pesticide has its own physicochemical/biochemical properties and management purposes, including target diseases/insects/weeds and target crop. The characters of each target pest and crop are also largely diverse. In addition there are a lot of pesticide formulation and application methods. Thus, various routes exist in pesticide exposure to crop and soil. First is the direct exposure of crop to pesticides, which includes the application of target/applicable crop and drift to non-target crop. The second is indirect exposure of non-target plants via variety of routes. Soil, water and air or their combinations are major media for pesticide behavior. Pesticides intentionally or accidentally applied pollute soil in arable land. It persists in soil by several kinds of intermolecular interactions. “Aging” is an important idea to deal with pesticide persistence in soil. The bioavailability and/or the extractability from bound residues are getting more difficult with time. It largely affects length of persistence of pesticides in soil. Pesticides largely move with water in soil to ground water and on soil to surface water. Dissolved organic matter and suspended solid should be taken into account on pesticide contamination in water. POPs high bioaccumulation, and long distance transport have long persistence in the environment. Methyl bromide had been used intensively worldwide. These were transported to the atmosphere causing problems both to human and the environment. There are a lot of approaches to the problem on pesticide residues in crop and soils. In the viewpoint of air pollution, the risk of spray drift is assessed in EU and USA by computer simulation models. However, it is very difficult to introduce them in Japan due to the limitation of buffer zone. Therefore, application methods and drift guards as alternatives prevent spray drift, which fits small-scale farming. In addition, vapor drift, which has two states (gas and/or particle-adsorption), also have very important issues to be considered. Multimedia model for global behavior of organic chemicals were based on “fugacity capacity” developed just recently in Japan. There are three types of on-site remediation methods in soil. Those were phytoremediation, bioremediation, and chemical remediation. Grafting method can be used in cucumber/pumpkin combination in phytoremediation of drins. Bioremediation is effective for on-site remediation of pesticides and POPs. The practically effective bacterial consortia, which degrade triazines, were found in our institute. Chemical remediation is useful with single or in combination with the above remediation methods. Computer simulation models for pesticide behavior in paddy-river system were developed in Japan and in Europe. In diatom, good correlation was observed in the 50% effective concentration (EC50) values of dimethametryn between the native colonies and the cumulative values of isolated single species. Large difference in susceptibility was observed between the upper and middle reaches of stream. Crop residue is not simple, due to the following reasons, 1) many exposure ways to existing pesticides, 2) pesticide transport to edible parts depend upon crop and pesticide combination, and 3) pesticides are metabolized not only in soil but also in crop. Pesticide registration in minor crops is a social problem in Japan. There are more than 200 crops, which could not be categorized in 11 minor

N2  - Although arable landscapes have a long history, environmental problems have accelerated in recent decades. The effects of these changes are usually externalized, being greater for society as a whole than for the farms on which they operate, and incentives to correct them are therefore largely lacking. Arable landscapes are valued by society beyond the farming community, but increased mechanization and farm size, simplification of crop rotations, and loss of non-crop features, have led to a reduction in landscape diversity. Low intensity arable systems have evolved a characteristic and diverse fauna and flora, but development of high input, simplified arable systems has been associated with a decline in biodiversity. Arable intensification has resulted in loss of non-crop habitats and simplification of plant and animal communities within crops, with consequent disruption to food chains and declines in many farmland species. Abandonment of arable management has also led to the replacement of such wildlife with more common and widespread species. Soils have deteriorated as a result of erosion, compaction, loss of organic matter and contamination with pesticides, and in some areas, heavy metals. Impacts on water are closely related to those on soils as nutrient and pesticide pollution of water results from surface runoff and subsurface flow, often associated with soil particles, which themselves have economic and ecological impacts. Nitrates and some pesticides also enter groundwater following leaching from arable land. Greatest impacts are associated with simplified, high input arable systems. Intensification of arable farming has been associated with pollution of air by pesticides, NO2 and CO2, while the loss of soil organic matter has reduced the system's capacity for carbon sequestration. International trade contributes to global climate change through long distance transport of arable inputs and products. The EU Rural Development Regulation (1257/99) provides an opportunity to implement measures for alleviating ecological impacts of arable management through a combination of cross-compliance and agri-environment schemes. To alleviate the problems described in this paper, such measures should take account of opportunities for public/private partnerships and should integrate social, cultural, economic and ecological objectives for multifunctional land use.

T1  - Chemicals and Infertility at a Glance

N2  - Never in the human history have so many changes happened in the life style and the environments. This was done due to the revolution in the science and technology. During last decades, reproductive medicine as a whole and male infertility in particular has changed tremendously. This change happened in the field of proper evaluation, findings of numerous etiological factors such as anatomical, genetic environmental, underlying diseases and so on. This helped clinicians to have more relevant understandings regarding this social problem that has roots in the history of man kind as well as civilization. The knowledge about infertility paralleled with the progress made in the techniques of the treatment. The advances in current reproductive technologies were made clear after cloning of a sheep, resulting in the birth of Dolly. Although, human cloning is a concept that remains highly controversial, there have been steady advances in the assisted reproductive techniques such as blastocyst transfer and intra cytoplasmic sperm injection methods. Although these rather new techniques helped many infertile men to be a father, the old dream that they had, many other men who were fertile lost their potential fertility due to various reasons such as exposure to physical, chemical, biological and other environmental hazard agents. Changes in life style, environmental pollutions, such as air, contamination of water and soil by different toxic materials, chemicals of industrial wastes, modernized in food processing, preserving and serving, possible contamination of environmental hazards agents by warfare used in local, regional and world wars might had affected human health and caused male infertility. There was no record of infertility published among soldiers who were exposed to chemical warfare during first or second world wars. As it was expected; infertility was a major proved problem in Iran-Iraq war among Iranian soldiers who exposed to chemical warfare. Advance treatment of malignancy by widespread use of chemotherapy was associated with improvement in cancer survival but its set back effect was testicular dysfunction and infertility. During chemotherapy, most patients demonstrate elevation of serum FSH levels that well correlates with the development of azoospermia. These findings were frequently requested for the utilization of sperm bank among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Exposure to chemical warfare and chemotherapy are not the only factors which effecting fertility. Exposure of workers at chemical, petrochemical and many other relevant industries, farmers who use pesticides, people that regularly use home insecticides, and even ordinary people who live in polluted areas may be the victims of infertility. At the present time human being is faced with serious environmental crisis. Although, tackling these agonies are essential for preserving mankind, but certainly this catastrophic problem will never be solved unless international cooperation and collaboration regarding this matter happens.

N2  - This study examined the levels of heavy metals in soil, water, and vegetables (amaranthus, hibiscussabdariffa, and allium cepa leaves) around the industrial area Bauchi, Northeastern Nigeria. The composite samples of soil, water, and vegetables were collected and determine the level of heavy metals (Mn, Zn, Cd, Pb, and As) using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS). The level of the heavy metals decreased in the order of Mn > Zn > Pb > Cd, Pb > Zn > Mn > Cd, and Mn > Zn > Mn > Cd in the soil, water, and vegetables respectively. Among the vegetables, amaranthus had the highest heavy metals level followed by allium cepa leaves and hibiscus sabdariffa. The levels of heavy metals obtained were below the tolerance level recommended by the world health organization (WHO). The bio-concentration factors of the heavy metals for the studied samples were below one except Zn in amaranthus. The daily intake of metals for Mn was found to be the highest in amaranthus for children and estimated to be 1.149 mg/person/day. Health risk index of Zn for amaranthus and allium cepa leaves for children and Pb for amaranthus, hibiscus sabdariffa and allium cepa leaves for both children and adults were above 1, except in hibiscus sabdariffa for adults, signifying provable of health risks for the consumption of the vegetables in the study area. Therefore, the consumption of these vegetables as food could pose a health hazard, and regular monitoring is recommended to prevent metal accumulation with their associated health implications in the consuming public.

Environmental pollution can as a result of unfavorable production of man’s activities such as mining, combustion, applications of fertilizers and pesticides (Reynolds et al., 2015; Hazrat et al., 2019). Chemical substances from the activities such as heavy metals are one of the factors which contribute to environmental pollutions and it was believed that it can disrupt the living ecosystem (Kabata-Pendias and Pendias, 2001). Currently, anthropogenic inputs of metals above the natural levels due to an increase in industrialization and urbanization (Varalakshmi and Ganeshamurthy, 2010, Sulaiman et al., 2020). Industrial wastes, atmospheric deposition from crowded cities, and other domestic wastes are among the major sources of heavy metals in the surface water, groundwater, and soils (Raymond et al., 2011; Qingwei et al., 2020). Heavy Metals are natural constituents of the earth’s crust, with an atomic density greater than 5 gcm, an atomic number >20 and the most common heavy metal contaminants are Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn (Garba et al., 2018). Heavy metals have been given considerable concern worldwide due to their toxicity and accumulative behavior (Alinnor, 2008; Sulaiman et al., 2019a). Heavy metal contamination of soil, water, and atmosphere signifies a rising environmental problem that may enter the food chain as a result of their uptake by edible plants, affecting food quality and human health (Chibuike and Obiora, 2014; Zwolak et al., 2019; Hazrat et al., 2019). Heavy metals in a surface, groundwater and soils could either from natural or anthropogenic sources (Duke and Williams, 2008; Vhahangwele and Khathutshelo, 2018). The consumption of vegetables and fruits as food offer rapid and least means of providing adequate vitamin supplies, minerals, and fiber. Vegetables are used as food include those used in making soups or served as integral parts of the main sources of a meal (Arora, 2008), but the accumulation of heavy metals in the soil may affect soil properties and inhibit plant growth. Moreover, several studies showed that fruits and leafy vegetables are vulnerable Levels of Heavy Metals in Soil, Water and Vegetables..... 1528 SULAIMAN, BA; SULAIMAN, MB; AHMED, A; MAIGARI, IA; TIJJANI, AF to heavy metals contamination from air, water, and soil (Sulaiman et al., 2019b). The consumption of vegetable growth in contaminated soils is one of the contributing factors to human exposure to heavy metals (Zhuang et al., 2009; Ogbonna and Okezie, 2011; Sulaiman et al., 2019b). On the other hand; Pb is relatively highly toxic to higher animals. It is absorbed and translocated to plant tissues, from which it affects animals and humans when consumed with plants (Rodríguez et al., 2018). Thus, the evaluation of the levels of heavy metals in environmental samples is very important. The present work, evaluate levels of heavy metals in soils, water, and some of the vegetables and assessed the health associated with consumption of the vegetables from Bauchi industrial area, Northeastern Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS Study area: The study was conducted at Gwallaga along Bauchi industrial area, Bauchi State, northeastern part of Nigeria (Fig1). It is located between longitude 10.10 N-10.33N and latitude 9.40E-10.13E. It occupies an estimated land area of 3,687 km and altitude is 690.2 m above sea level. The climate is tropical with two distinct seasons; rainy (May-October) and dry/harmattan (November-April) seasons; with a temperature of between 23 C and 40 C and an average rainfall of 1.0914 mm. The daily humidity increases to 94% in the middle of the rainy season but falls to less than 10% during the dry season (Sulaiman et al., 2018; Barambu et al., 2020). Fig 1: A map shows the study area in Bauchi, Bauchi State, Nigeria. Samples collection: Samples of soil, water, and vegetables (amaranthus, hibiscus sabdariffa, and allium cepa leaves) were collected from Gwallaga along Bauchi industrial area, Bauchi state. All samples were randomly collected; at the sampling point, three sub-samples were collected to form a composite sample. Soil samples were collected using plastic spade up 15 cm depth and vegetable samples were collected from the study site. The collected soil and vegetable samples were put into clean polythene bags and labeled, while water samples were put in previously washed, rinsed, and dried bottles. A total of 12, 12, and 36 of soil, water, and vegetable samples were collected respectively. The samples were brought to the laboratory for analysis. Soil samples preparation and analysis: The soil samples were air-dried and crushed in a mortar and pestle and passed through a 2 mm mesh sieve to remove debris. 2.0 g of air-dried sample was weighed in a beaker and few drops of distilled water were used. 15cm of aqua regia (3:1 HCl:HNO3) was added and the mixture was heated for 1 hour at 120 C, 2.0 cm HClO4 was added and evaporated to approximately 0.5 cm after cooling the residue was dissolved with 2%HNO3, filtered before transferred to a 50 cm volumetric flask and made up to the mark with 2% HNO3 (Kudirat and Fummilayo, 2011). Vegetable samples preparation and analysis: The vegetables were air-dried and grounded with mortar and pestle sieved through 2 mm mesh sieve, 2.0 g portion of the sample was weighed into 100cm Kyeildal digestion flask, 15 ml of concentrated HNO3 was added followed by 3 ml each of concentrated H2SO4 and 12 ml 60-62% HClO4, in the ratio of 5:1:4 ratio respectively. The flask was cooled and the content was made up to the mark with deionized water and transferred to 125 cm polyethene cans and stored for heavy metal determination with (unicam 919 AAS). Levels of Heavy Metals in Soil, Water and Vegetables..... 1529 SULAIMAN, BA; SULAIMAN, MB; AHMED, A; MAIGARI, IA; TIJJANI, AF Water samples preparation and analysis: 50 cm of water sample was measured into a beaker. A mixture of 10 cm of concentrated HNO3 and HCl in the ratio of 1:3 was added, it was evaporated to a smaller volume and the filtrate was transferred into a 100 cm volumetric flask and made up to a mark with distilled water and ready for atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Unicam 919 AAS). Bioaccumulation factor: The bioaccumulation factor is the ratio of the concentration of heavy metals in a plant to the concentration of heavy metals in soil, i.e the translocation of heavy metals from soil to vegetables (Naser et al., 2012; Sharma et al., 2018; Sulaiman et al., 2019; Gebeyehu and Bayissa 2020; Gemeda et al., 2020).

N2  - Pesticides have considerably increased agricultural output, but their overuse presents serious threats to human health, food safety, and the environment. Alarmingly, only around 1% of pesticides used reach their intended pests, with the remainder polluting soil, water, and air. This causes broad environmental contamination and negative consequences on non-target animals, including people. Top pesticide-consuming countries, including China, the United States, and Brazil, confront considerable issues due to residual pesticide buildup. Recent biotechnology developments provide intriguing pesticide mitigation strategies. Engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains have developed as very efficient bioremediation agents. These genetically engineered microbes are intended to convert hazardous chemicals into harmless metabolites. E. coli strains are tailored for increased expression of pesticide-degrading genes using modern genetic and metabolic engineering, dramatically enhancing their ability to break down hazardous chemicals. Studies have shown that modified E. coli may degrade persistent pesticides such as Paraoxon and p-nitrophenol (PNP), turning them to harmless molecules. These bacteria may reach great densities, making them ideal for large-scale detoxifying operations. Furthermore, recombinant DNA technology enables the development of E. coli strains with several copies of degradation genes, which improves their bioremediation capacities. Despite these advances, obstacles persist, including biosafety issues and the need for regulatory supervision. Ongoing research is critical for addressing these concerns and developing safer, more sustainable agriculture techniques. Engineered E. coli strains represent a substantial advancement in pesticide mitigation, providing a feasible approach for reducing environmental pollution and protecting human health.

N2  - Adequate knowledge is required to determine the toxicity degree of heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury in the human body causing adverse effects and chronic diseases like autism for kids. Microwave-assisted digestion, hair sampling using HNO3 solution combined with H2O2 hydrogen peroxide and the measurement by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) were used for the element determination. A study conducted on hair samples of 40 individuals ranging from 5 years to 17 years (school age) living in Malang in 2017 aimed to determine the level of heavy metals (Cd, Pb and Hg) across autism and normal children technique (ICP-MS). The results of replicate analysis shows the following mean concentrations (μg/g), Autsim cd 4.34 ± 0.06, Pb 44.75 ± 0.56 Hg 1.70 ± 0.078 and Normal Cd 2.63 ± 0.04, Pb 48.49 ± 0.80 Hg, 1.54 ± 0.13, indicating a higher concentration compared to the standard certified value GBW07601. The higher concentration of all the heavy metals (Cd, Pb, and Hg) occurred in both normal children and children with autism disease. The comparison noted that cadmium percentage was higher than elemental mercury in children with autism and vice versa in normal children. Yet, the concentration of both elements was higher in children with autism. Nonetheless, lead was found higher in normal children. It is also supported by several studies confirming the relationship between organic mercury and nervous system including autism disease. On the other hand, in this study, we found no statistically significant differences in the concentrations of heavy metals (Pb, Cd, and Hg,) between the normal children and children with autism disease. Keyword: heavy metal, autism, hair, children, indicator. INTRODUCTION Heavy metals are the main threat to human health, these metals have been extensively studied and their effects on human health regularly have been reviewed by international bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO). Although several adverse health effects of heavy metals have been known over a long period of time, the exposure to heavy metals continues to happen. Toxic elements can be very harmful even at low concentration when ingested for a long time. Toxic heavy metals that should be concerned at most are cadmium, lead, and mercury. The exposure to these metals is a continuous daily process as they can be found at the place of work, in potable water, in food, and in the air. The toxicity of metals stems from the fact that they are biologically non-degradable and have the tendency to accumulate in water, sediment and fish. Metal contamination of the environment results both from natural sources and industrial activities. Metals in soil and water may enter the food cycle with an additional contribution from air. The general population is primarily exposed to mercury through food, fish is a major source of methyl mercury exposure and dental amalgam. In addition, mercury also derives from Hg-containing pharmaceuticals administered to the mother while the child is growing in utero and injected organic-Hg from Thimerosal. Thimerosal is an organic-Hg compound (49.55% Hg weight) added to vaccines as a preservative, typically at concentrations from 0.005% to 0.01% (12.5 μg Hg or 25 μg Hg per 0.5 mL vaccine dose). Major sources of Pb pollution are exhaust gases of petrol engines, which account for nearly 80% of the total Pb in the air. Soils located near Pb mines may contain high Pb content of 0.5%. Apart from minerals, sources of Pb are pesticides, fertilizer impurities, emissions from mining and smelting operations, as well as atmospheric fallouts from the combustion of fossil fuels. Either organic or inorganic form of lead is absorbed through the lungs and gastrointestinal. Organic lead can also be absorbed through a skin. Inhalation exposure is more common in an occupational setting. Up to 94% of the body burden contained lead is in bone, where it has a half-life of years to decades. The lead would inhibit calcium-binding protein. Children and adolescents are more vulnerable to heavy metal poisoning, and can suffer from improper mental Mohamed et al. / Evaluation on Mercury... IJPCR, Volume 9, Issue 12: December 2017 Page 711 development and low intelligent quotients (Hope 2017). One of the disorders that result from the interplay between genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental hazards is Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autism is a serious neurodevelopment al disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and other restricted behaviors. The number of children reported with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) has increased dramatically during the last 10 years. Toxic heavy metals as mercury, aluminum, and lead represent potential environmental hazardous factors that might lead to the ASD development. Moreover, most of the studies confirmed that here is a strong relationship between chronic diseases (such as autism) and the accumulation of organic mercury compound during injection for children. Mohamed et al., analyzed the relation between intoxication with heavy metals and ASD. They assessed the level of aluminum, lead, and mercury in hair samples of 100 autistic children compared to age and sex matched those of healthy controls. Hair sampling was chosen because it is seen as the best non-invasive maneuver indicating the level of a given mineral in the body. They discovered significantly higher levels of all measured heavy metals in autistic children compared to controls with positive relation to exposure to risk factors for heavy metals intoxication like extensive antenatal consumption of fish, maternal smoking, cooking in aluminum pots, and anti-D intake. Autistic children are defective in metabolizing sulfur compounds that cause significant reduction of their abilities to detoxify heavy metals and increases their toxicity, with subsequent negative impact on the development of the brain and normal CNS functions. Mercury is neurotoxicity and it has been shown to specifically target long-range axons in the brain. In addition, Hg is able to potentiate the effects of other xenobiotics such that a combined exposure from different sources should be seriously concerned because cumulative effects from various sources could potentially increase a child’s Hg body burden. Moreover, lead also causes significant oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation either directly or indirectly, alters synaptic pruning, interferes with glutamate; an excitatory neurotransmitter that is thought to be related to normal development of neurons, lowers hippocampal expression of protein kinase C (PKC), and produces volume loss in vital portions of the prefrontal cortex. Accordingly, many authors postulated that lead is never safe whatever its level is and can result in aberrant learning and defective neurobehavioral at levels as low as 10 μg/dl. In addition, humans are susceptible to toxicity sources, primarily Cadmium. Gastrointestinal ingestion of Cd through food or drinking water is the major route of intake for this metal. In addition, this metal can also derive from mining and metallurgical activities of tanning industries. However, still, Cigarette smoke is the largest source of Cd exposure because each cigarette can contain up to 6.67 μg Cd, and 40-60% of it generally passes through the pulmonary epithelium into systemic circulation. Chronic Cadmium intoxication results mainly in renal disease but acute Cadmium exposure primarily results in liver accumulation and hepatocellular damage, occurring after the acute exposure to inorganic forms of Cadmium. Another emerging issue related to the environmental heavy metal toxicity that needs to be seriously taken into account is the increasing incidence (1 out of 150 children) of autism spectrum disorder recently reported by Center for Disease Control. High blood levels of heavy metals in autistic children suggest a possible relationship to heavy metal exposures such as Pb, Cd, and Hg. The potential role of Hg in the disease process gains some support from the possible relationship with a single agent in the environment with the incidence of a neurodegenerative disease process including autism. Despite the great number of studies being made concerning cellular and the molecular dysfunctions associated with autism. There are several biological specimens that can be obtained in a non-invasive way – saliva, hair, and nails. That kind of sample collection does not require special facilities and close supervision of private functions. One of the crucial points in non-conventional matrices is the possibility to extend the time window of detection over weeks or months, as the assessment of chronic disease and cumulative exposure monitoring performed through hair samples. These specimens can contain proteins, lipids, various enzymes, carbohydrates, which interfere with the analyte determination. The type of sample is one of a few factors that should be taken into account in choosing an analytical technique prior to final analysis, isolation and/or pre-concentration. Hair may constitute a suitable material for the evaluation of environmental metal exposure, including mercury, lead, and cadmium. The type of environment is connected with the place. The effect of the environment on concentrations of mercury, lead, and cadmium in human hair has been shown in several studies by many references. The content of analyzed metals in hair is significantly affected by the diet or some drugs. The place of residence also has an effect on the concentrations of these metals in hair. Inhabitants of rural areas have lower metal contents in their hair than those living in big cities. The height and weight of examined individuals do not have an effect on concentrations of lead and cadmium in their hair. Hair analysis is inexpensive and fast; it also detects and measures the content of heavy metals and minerals of the hair. The Global Enviro

N2  - Food gives an ideal nourishment source to microorganisms and for the most part has pH esteem in the reach expected to add to multiplication. During gathering, handling, dissemination, and planning, food is tainted with soil, air, and waterborne microorganisms. Amazingly high quantities of microorganisms are found in meat creatures' intestinal lots, and a portion of these discover their way to the body surfaces during collecting. Some evidently sound creatures may hold different microorganisms in the liver, kidneys, lymph hubs, and spleen. These microorganisms and those from defilement through butchering can move to the skeletal muscles by means of the circulatory framework. At the point when corpses and slices are thusly dealt with through the food appropriation channels, where they are decreased to retail cuts, they are exposed to an expanding number of microorganisms from the cut surfaces. The destiny of these microorganisms and those from different food sources rely upon a few significant natural components, like the capacity of the creatures to use new food as a substrate at low temperatures. Likewise, oxygenated conditions and high dampness will isolate the microorganisms generally equipped for fast development under these conditions. Refrigeration, perhaps the most feasible techniques for decreasing the impacts of contam ination, is generally applied to food sources in business food preparing and dispersion. Its utilization has forestalled flare-ups of foodborne sickness by controlling the microorganisms answerable for this condition. Nonetheless, right methods for cold stockpiling often are not followed, and food defilement may result. The development pace of microorganisms may support a huge expansion in a climate marginally over the negligible temperature needed for development. For the most part, food sources cool gradually in air, and the cooling rate diminishes with expanded holder size. Subsequently, it is hard to appropriately cool huge volumes of food. A considerable lot of the Clostridium perfringens foodborne ailment flare-ups have been brought about by the capacity of an enormous amount of food or stock in gradually cooling compartments. ID of tainting sources in a food creation office impacts straightforwardly a definitive viability of a foundation's disinfection control procedures. Both immediate and backhanded food-contact surfaces, water, air, and faculty are essential zones of worry as pollution sources in a food plant. Food items may send certain microorganisms, causing foodborne ailment from contaminations or inebriations. Foodborne contaminations can bring about two different ways: •The contaminating microorganism is ingested and afterward duplicates, as is valid for Salmonella, Shigella, and some enteropathogenic Escherichia coli. •Toxins are delivered as the microorganisms duplicate, sporulate, or lyse. Instances of such diseases are C. perfringens and a few strains of enteropathogenic E. coli. This issue of Foods is devoted to examine the microbial, compound and actual pollution difficulties of food items. Food defilement is by and large characterized as food varieties that are ruined or polluted in light of the fact that they either contain microorganisms, like microscopic organisms or parasites, or poisonous substances that make them ill-suited for utilization. A food toxin can be organic, synthetic or physical in nature, with the previous being more normal. These impurities have a few courses all through the inventory network (homestead to fork) to enter and make a food item unsuitable for utilization. Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium botulinum, C. perfrigens, Pathogenic Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholera, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus and Yersinia enterocolitica are basic bacterial dangers (a kind of natural pollutant). Synthetic food toxins that can enter the food inventory network incorporate pesticides, substantial metals, and other outsider compound specialists. The World Health Organization (WHO) has perceived food defilement as a worldwide test in a few archives and reports. It is plainly recognized in an explanation: "food pollution that happens in one spot may influence the soundness of shoppers living on the opposite side of the planet”. Indeed, a dominant part of individuals experience a foodborne or waterborne sickness eventually in their lives around the world. Accordingly, utilization of sullied food varieties causes ailment in huge number of individuals and many bite the dust because of it. This situation makes "food tainting" a significant issue. The rundown of food pollution challenges is long and continues to develop. I would list three difficulties, new produce tainting, anti-infection agents in food items and purposeful defilement of food varieties, to feature the significance of this point.

N2  - Milk is the fluid normally secreted by female mammals for the nourishment of their young ones. It is a compulsory part of daily diet for the expectant mothers as well as growing children. Milk and milk products are ideal foods for all age groups in both rural and urban people all around the world.1 Milk is defined to be the lacteal secretion, practically free from colostrums, obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows, 5 days after and 15 days before parturition.2 Raw untreated milk is still used by large number of farm families and workers and by a growing segment of the general population who believe that the milk is not only safe but also imparts beneficial health effects that are destroyed by pasteurization.3 Milk is considered a complete and nutritious food; not only for the new-born mammal and for the human beings, but it is considered as a good medium for many microorganisms.3,4 It starts its journey in the udder of a mammal as a sterile substance, but as it passes out of the teat, it is inoculated by the animal’s normal flora.5 Being a nutritionally balanced food stuff with a low microbial load when drawn from the udder of a healthy cow, milk gets contaminated at various stages including the cow itself, the milker’s hand or milking equipment, storage vessels and water supply particularly when used for adulteration.6‒8 Milk being a major constituent of human diet, can serve as a good medium for the growth of many microorganisms especially bacterial pathogens, therefore its quality control is considered essential to the health and welfare of a community. The threat posed by diseases spread through contaminated milk is well known and the epidemiological impact of such diseases is considerable. The presence of these pathogenic microorganisms in milk has emerged as a major public health concern especially for those individuals who still drink raw milk.9 Milk is virtually a sterile fluid when secreted into alveoli of udder. However, beyond this stage of production, microbial contamination might generally occur from three main sources; within the udder, exterior to the udder and from the surface of milk handling and storage equipments, but the surrounding air, feed, soil, feces and grass are also possible sources of contamination. Raw milk is usually colonized by a variety of many zoonotic pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureu sand Yersinia enterocolitica. Therefore, they represent an important source of food borne pathogens. These pathogens in milk have been linked to the environment in the farm, mixing clean milk with mastitis milk and from livestock.10 E.coli frequently contaminates food organism and it is a good indicator of fecal pollution.11 Presence of E. coli in milk products indicates the presence of enters pathogenic microorganisms, which constitute a public health hazard. E. coli is among many pathogenic microorganisms which can access to milk and some of dairy products which considered a reliable indicator of contamination by manure, soil and contaminated water.12 Therefore, the purpose of this study is to isolate and identify E. coli from raw cow`s milk samples taken from selected dairy farms in and around Mekelle and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of E. coli isolates.

T1  - Groundwater potential risk of agricultural activity in Vercelli Plain, North Italy
A1  - Zhao, Ye
Y1  - 2013///
N2  - As the increasing population and food consumption, more and more agriculture and natural resources are needed to keep the pace with the demands. To meet this gap, land expansion and land intensification are required, which consequently lead to problems like climate change, biodiversity loss and degradation of land soil and water bodies. Therefore, the principal challenge of agriculture expansion in the following decades, will be achieving an appropriate equilibrium between sufficient food and fiber production for the growing global population and meanwhile minimizing environmental cost. Agrochemicals can harm human health, as can pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant pathogens associated with certain animal test. Therefore, it is extremely urgent to develop a relative precise and cost effective method to evaluate the influence of agriculture activity on groundwater quality in regional areas. Thanks to the development of geographic information systems (GIS), which is ideally suited to the mapping and analyzing groundwater vulnerability factors over regions. The whole thesis deals with the relation between agrochemical application and potential risk of aquifer that beneath agricultural land use. In the first chapter, DRASTIC model and SINTACS model were used to determine the intrinsic vulnerability of the groundwater and the model output results were compared. Both of the two models showed that most of the Vercelli plain's groundwater is at high to very high risk in terms of pollution potential. Moreover, the results of this chapter reveal that the pesticide contamination in groundwater is much serious than nitrate in the rice paddy field, which is the main agricultural land in the study area. In chapter 2, the water balance in the rice paddy was calculated on the base of measured data on a field scale in 6 treatments. Different agriculture treatments and irrigation management are the main factors influencing the infiltration rate. It was also found that the infiltration rate could be a negative value, assuming that the interaction between the flooded water of rice paddy and shallow aquifer could influence the infiltration rate. Based on the study of water balance in rice field, the fate a transport of agrochemical can be simulated. RICEWQ model and the developed N mass balance model both considered little about the risk of groundwater by agrochemicals, although the detected agrochemicals concentrations in groundwater were used to verify the simulation result. The water type of the shallow alluvial aquifer in Vercelli Plain mainly belonged to Mg-Ca-HCO3. Seeing the trend over time, no obvious upward or downward trend of pesticide concentration was observed in shallow aquifers. The change of agrochemicals concentration in groundwater coincided with the change of the groundwater table. Related to the relative low health risk based on reported toxicity study, the harm to human health is slight. However, the study only considers the exposure routs from groundwater, the routes through air and soil have not been estimated here

N2  - This study assessed the uptake and distribution of fluoride in maize and beans grown in fluoride contaminated soils, (Ngarenanyuki) around Mount Meru in Northern Tanzania during the rainy season. The study revealed that fluoride uptake increases with increasing fluoride concentration in soils except in a stem and root part of maize and beans respectively. It was observed that fluoride accumulation followed the order of soil >roots > leaves >stem >grain > cob for maize, while the order soil> root> grain> stem was observed for the beans. when the soil contained 116.93ppm of fluoride, the corresponding plants harvested had the mean fluoride accumulation (ppm dry weight) in root, leaves, stem, grain, and cob of maize of 38.560, 24.251, 10.629, 7.7756 and 2.100 respectively, while the soil with 129.2ppm mean fluoride concentration, the accumulation in root, grain, and stem of beans were 16.27, 11.328 and 8.459 respectively. It was reported that beans plant had a higher efficiency in fluoride uptake to bean grain than maize plant. Maize and bean grain collected from Ngarenanyuki contains higher fluoride levels than other fluoride endemic areas. It was also reported that fluoride in the soil samples has a strongly positive correlation with sodium (p-0.000). This suggests that there is a high possibility of fluoride to be present in the form of NaF. Significant accumulation of fluoride in both bean and maize were observed in this study at p≤ 0.05. *Corresponding Author: Khairia Masawe  masawek@nm-aist.ac.tz Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences (JBES) ISSN: 2220-6663 (Print) 2222-3045 (Online) Vol. 15, No. 5, p. 29-36, 2019 http://www.innspub.net J. Bio. & Env. Sci. 2019 30 | Masawe et al. Introduction Soil pollution by the fluoride ion (F), caused by natural activities, is currently becoming a serious global environmental problem (Pratap and Singh, 2013). Fluoride is not a vital element to plants, although fluoride concentrations in plant part have been reported to be higher and in wide variation (Arnesen, 1997), (Chakrabarti, Patra, and Mondal, 2013). Fluoride contamination is a severe problem in most part of northern Tanzania, more prominently in Ngarenanyuki, Arusha (Ghiglieri et al., 2010), (Gumbo and Mkongo, 1995). Ngarenanyuki is a semiarid area located at the slope of Mount Meru. Studies conducted by (Ghiglieri et al., 2010), (Ghiglieri et al., 2012), (John Mkungu, Revocatus Lazaro Machunda, 2014) and reported high fluoride concentrations in agricultural soils associated with weathering of rocks and other natural environmental factors. Reportedly, plants can absorb fluoride from soil, water, pesticide, and fertilizer through plant roots (Anbuvel et al., 2015). Acceptance of fluoride by the plant relies on soil pH, plant species and fluoride activity (Domingos et al., 2003). The reactive behavior of fluoride makes it appear in complex forms with other ions. This further enhances its uptake and translocation to the shoots and other parts of the plant (Stevens, McLaughlin and Alston, 1998). The commencement symptoms which may be observed in plants when exposed to fluoride depends on many factors such as concentration, time of exposure, type and age of plant, temperature, type of light and intensity, composition of the air, and its rate of circulation (Greenwood, 1956). To that effect, high fluoride accumulation in plant led to abnormal fruit development, chlorosis, leaf alteration and synthesis of poison enzyme (Garrec, Plebin, and Faivre-Pierret, 1984). Intake of fluoride via food can have implication to human health (Chakrabarti, Patra, and Mondal, 2013). For instance, Fluoride is an essential element to human beings and animals. It strengthens the bones or enamel to prevent dental caries when taken in suitable amount (John Mkungu, Revocatus Lazaro Machunda, 2014). Excessive dietary intake of fluoride makes bones brittle or mottling the teeth and causes different types of fluorosis, such as primarily dental fluorosis, skeletal fluorosis and crippling fluorosis depending on the level and period of exposure (John Mkungu, Revocatus Lazaro Machunda, 2014). The World Health Organization (WHO, 1984) has set up the maximum acceptable limits of fluoride in drinking water at 1.5mg/l (Jha, Nayak and Sharma, 2009). Despite this, there are no strict threshold limits of fluoride in soil to plants which is reported to affect human upon consumption (Jha, Nayak and Sharma, 2009). Beans and maize are among the staple food consumed by the population as vegetable and crops respectively. Due to their frequency in use and cultivation by the communities along the Mount Meru area, we thought they are worth to be investigated to understand if they could accumulate fluoride from the soil into their various parts. In this study, beans and maize were used to investigate fluoride accumulation and uptake when grown on contaminated soil under the ambient environmental condition of Ngarenanyuki. Materials and methods Description of the study area The study was conducted in Ngarenanyuki ward located in Arumeru District on the slopes of Mount Meru have approximately 54,000 acres (Kihampa, Ram Mato and Mohamed, 2010). This ward comprises of five villages Uwiro, Ngabobo, Olkung’wado, Kisimiri Chini and Kisimiri Juu located at 3°9'0'' South, 36°51'0'' East. The climatic condition of Mount Meru is oceanic rainfall with continental temperatures. Rainfall data indicate that the Southern slopes of mount Meru receive much higher rainfall of up to 1000 mm than the southeastern slope which receives 950 mm rainfall per year (John Mkungu, Revocatus Lazaro Machunda, 2014). The mean annual temperature decreases linearly upslope with a lapse rate of 0.56°C per 100m starting at the foothills and the maximum and minimum temperature on the lower slopes (settlement areas) ranges are 15 30°C and 12 l7°C, respectively (John Mkungu, Revocatus Lazaro Machunda, 2014). According to the 2012 census, the area has a total population of 20,379 and the main source of income J. Bio. & Env. Sci. 2019 31 | Masawe et al. is from small-scale farming whereby people cultivate food and cash crops (Kihampa, Ram Mato and Mohamed, 2010). Establishment of the experimental plot This study was based on the accumulation of fluoride in beans and maize. The trials were carried under ambient environmental condition (From February to May 2018) during the rainy season. Three experimental plots were selected (Momela, Uwiro and Olkung’wadu). Land preparation involved clearing, plowing and finally planting. The experimental design followed a randomized complete block design (RCBD) in a factorial arrangement with 3 replications per crop. The field plots measured 5m x 6m with 8 rows of maize spaced at (0.75m x 0.3m) apart and 8 rows of bean measured 5m x 2m spaced at (0.25m x 0.25m). The plots were interspaced by 1 m to allow management of crops. Maize seeds variety (Situka) was obtained from SEEDCO Seed Company found in Arusha and local bean seeds variety (Lyamungo 90) were acquired from the local market. Two seeds were planted and later thinned to one plants after full-plant establishment. The soil was treated with urea (nitrogenous fertilizer) at the middle session of the cultivation. In all three experimental plots four plants in each replicate were monitored and then harvested for analysis. Soil sample and analysis The soil samples were collected from experimental plots (Momela, Olkung’wadu and Uwiro) from topsoil to subsoil (0-20cm) and (20-40cm) respectively. The soil was thoroughly mixed, dried, and grinded and sieved through 2.0 mm sieve. The basic characteristics of the soil such as pH, Electrical conductivity (EC), Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Sodium, Magnesium, Phosphorous, Nitrogen, Potassium, Calcium content and extractable fluoride were determined and are specified in Table 1. EC and pH of the initial soil were determined by using ORION ion Analyser (5-Star series). Textural analysis (Sand, Silt, and Clay) of the soil was carried out by International Pipette method, extractable F by the method adopted by (Larsen, S. Widdowson, 1971). Total fluoride determination in beans and maize The collected plants were taken and their parts separated (leaves, root, stem, grains cob), oven-dried for 72 hours at 60oC and grinded into powder, and sieved through a 40-mesh. The extracts were prepared and placed in Milestone Ethos Easy (MEE) with nitric acid at 65% and hydrogen peroxide at 30% followed by neutralization with aqueous KOH that used to digest fluoride in plant samples. Then extracted crop sample from MEE was mixed with TISAB and fluoride was measured by using Fluoride ion-selective electrode and indicated in tables 4 and 5 (Ahmad et al., 2015).

N2  - In Spring 2013, the Institute of Water Research of the Italian National Research Centre published a study on the presence of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the main Italian river basins, unveiling a serious contamination of water bodies and drinking water across the provinces of Vicenza and Padua. PFAS are man-made chemicals with a completely fluorinated carbon chain of various length, widely used for their heat-resistant and grease- and water-repelling properties. Until recently, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) were the two most employed PFAS congeners. PFAS are exploited for the production of fluoropolymers, non-stick and waterproof coverings, fire-fighting foams, lubricants, drugs, cosmetics, and pesticides. PFOA and PFOS are highly persistent in the environment and can spread at long distances through water and air. Moreover, they accumulate in biological tissues and along the food chain. The European Union Regulation 757/2010/EU included PFOS among Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). In 2013, PFOA was classified as a Persistent-Bioaccumulative-Toxic (PBT) substance and more recently (Reg. 2017/100/EU) it was added to the Annex XVII of the REACH Regulation (Reg. 1907/2006/EC). When the PFAS contamination in the Veneto Region was discovered, there were no enforceable thresholds for these substances in the various environmental matrices (soil, surface water, groundwater, drinking water). Afterwards, the European Directive 2013/39/EU added PFOS to the list of priority hazardous substances for water policy and set up Quality Standars in surface water and biota. Italy implemented the above-mentioned Directive with the Legislative Decree no. 172 of October 13 th 2015, which also established Quality Standars in surface water for five more perfluorinated compounds (PFOA; perfluorobutanoic acid, PFBA; perfluorobutane sulfonate, PFBS; perfluoropentanoic acid, PFPeA; and perfluorohexanoic acid, PFHxA). Moreover, with Decree of July 6 th 2016 the Italian Ministry of Environment established legal thresholds for PFBS, PFPeA, PFHxA, PFOA, and PFOS in groundwater. As regards drinking water, in January 2014 t he Italian Ministry of Health issued a statement of the National Institute of Health setting up performance thresholds for PFOA, PFOS and the sum of other PFAS. Recently, with Deliberation no. 1590 of October 3 rd 2017, the Veneto Regional Government established new and stricter performance thresholds in drinking water taking advantage of improved water filtering technologies, with the aim of attaining the maximum available protection of population health according to the precautionary principle. To tackle the issue of PFAS pollution, the Veneto Region adopted an integrated methodology for risk analysis and management, which took into account any possible exposure pathway for the population and required the coordinated action of many different Institutions and Stakeholders, under the oversight of the Regional Directorate of Prevention, Food Safety, and Veterinary Health. Municipalities involved in the contamination were identified and environmental matrices were analysed with the aim of performing a Health Impact Assessment and defining a Health Surveillance Plan for the exposed population.

N2  - The Second Agricultural Services Producer Organizations Project for Senegal is a national agricultural program on rural activities, mainly in the field of agriculture and animal husbandry. This environmental and social management framework gives an assessment of the environmental and social impacts, both beneficial and adverse that the project may entail, when implemented in whatever agro ecological area that may be concerned. Expected negative impacts associated with subprojects include: misuse of chemical pesticides and water pollution in the irrigation system; loss of pasturage for livestock and land degradation arising from overuse; clogging of the drainage system from stored materials, and interference with natural habitats if not ecosystem destruction; flooding; disease spread because of stagnant waters (including malaria and bilharzia) water contamination leading to dysentery and other diseases due to non-use of latrines and other unhygienic practices; conflicts over water usage; noise during blasting; erosion; soil salinization; the reduction of land able to be cultivated; lack of veterinary medicines; over-exploitation of forests; risk of contamination from pharmaceuticals improperly stored within households; environmental pollution from wastewater and solid waste from livestock; risk of marginalization of small producers due to market segmentation, the rise in the meat prices, infrastructure modernization and their maintenance costs, and unemployment of informal sector workers; loss of vegetal cover and increased erosion; lowering of the water table; and contamination due to pesticide use; air pollution and noxious odors; contamination of food products; and risk of fire, among other impacts. Mitigation measures may include: the rational use of pesticides, reserving spaces for foraging, restoring soil fertility, training farmers and farmer organizations to maintain flood works and in animal hygiene and veterinary techniques; latrine construction; conflict resolution used to control water usage; building of troughs and wells; installing of pumps far from residences; building irrigation canals for the dry season; replacing excavated material; providing compensation to displaced persons; using drainage works; replanting trees; integrated management of water resources; avoiding prolonged food storage; ensuring that imported animals are disease-free (have a certificate of health); encouraging traditional/local pastoral practices/indigenous knowledge and technical innovation, and improving traditional infrastructure; restoring the vegetal cover; establishing a waste management plan; promoting the use of organic fertilizer (manure); making selective site choices; wearing protective gear to avoid pesticide poisoning; avoiding the introduction of exotic species even if the risk is low; treating wastewater according to international norms; and raising sensitivity of sexually transmitted diseases among workers.

N2  - nological advances for improving pesticide detection. In addition, the report identifies several weaknesses in the food tolerance system, which establishes the maximum legal limits of pesticide residue which may be present in raw and processed foods. The report reveals that the state's detection capability is seriously limited. Testing methods currently in use cannot detect two-thirds of the pesticides registered for use on food by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Existing methods also fail to detect twothirds of the pesticides identified by EPA for their oncogenic (tumor-causing) potential, although these compounds "are the mainstays of agriculture's chemical arsenal." Additional findings reported by AOR include the following: -The existence of new detection technologies and improved analytical methods which could expand the state's detection capabilities; -The failure of existing law to provide incentives for pesticide registrants to "develop practical analytical methods for their products," especially when many existing methods are expensive, complex, and often out-of-date; -The failure of the Department of Health Services to develop and implement a program for routine testing of processed foods, despite statutory responsibility and the finding by its staff that such a program is needed because of the propensity for pesticides to concentrate in processed foods; and -The flawed nature of the food tolerance system, in that it "may underestimate dietary risk" because tolerances are based on inadequate health data; the consumption data used are outdated; the effects of inert ingredients and synergism are ignored; and tolerance levels are set for cancer-causing pesticides, meaning that a determination is made that some risk of cancer is acceptable-despite a "long-standing" tenet that "there is no exposure level so low it is known to be safe." AOR makes specific recommendations to the legislature in its report, including the following actions: -Identification of priority pesticides which pose health risks; -A requirement that priority pesticide registrants submit practical analytical methods to enable state laboratories to detect pesticide residues in food; -Implementation of a routine monitoring program for pesticide residues in processed foods; -Enactment of requirements that farmers maintain records of pesticide applications on food crops; -Legislation to direct the Department of Food and Agriculture to review existing testing methods for workability and effectiveness; -Prohibition of the use in pesticide formulations of inert ingredients known to cause cancer and other chronic adverse health effects; and -Adoption of an annual pesticide residue reporting system which would identify multiple residues detected on raw or processed food samples and the individual pesticides found. Integrated Solid Waste Management: Putting A Lid On Garbage Overload (April 1988), prepared jointly with the Assembly Natural Resources Committee, concerns the "increasingly ineffective" management of California's solid waste. The problems resulting from the state's management policy are recognized as potentially harmful to public health and the environment. The study reveals that in responding to disposal needs, state policy-as expounded by the California Waste Management Board (CWMB)-has placed "primary emphasis" on landfills and waste-to-energy projects. If the state continues to rely exclusively on these disposal methods, it will face a "serious statewide garbage crisis by or before the mid-1990s" because stiff public opposition has made waste-to-energy plants and landfills difficult to site. Public opposition to waste-to-energy projects centers on concerns over air pollution and litter. Presently, only one small waste-to-energy plant is operating in the state. CWMB continues to view landfills as the "cornerstone" of the Board's solid waste management policy. However, AOR's study concludes that this continued emphasis is likely to yield decreasing success because of the increasing costs of operating landfills and public opposition to siting based on legitimate health concerns. While providing case studies of problems at selected landfills, the study identifies health risks common to all such sites. Hazardous substances may leach from landfills to contaminate surrounding soil and nearby groundwater and surface water. Gas migration from landfills is known to create toxic air contaminants. Additionally, AOR staff found that many landfills were operating in violation of state and federal public health and environmental standards. Some of the most frequently found violations-inadequate leachate control barriers, inadequate drainage devices, lack of proper cover, and inadequate groundwater monitoring-may cause serious contamination of surrounding areas. AOR's report concludes that California's current solid waste management policy should be replaced with a multifaceted approach to solving the state's garbage disposal problems. Such an approach would allow for a limited reliance on landfills and waste-to-energy projects while giving "equal if not greater weight" to recycling, source reduction, and composting methods. The report includes the following specific recommendations: -Enactment of legislation to provide for "rigorous but realistic development and implementation of local waste reduction and recycling plans" to supplement and enhance current recycling markets; -Enhancement of existing foreign and domestic markets for recyclable materials through legislation which would, at minimum, strengthen state and local government procurement policies for those materials; -Establishment of comprehensive air, soil, and water protection requirements for existing and future landfills, with authority given to responsible state agencies to ensure that environmental protection standards are met at such sites; -Enactment of tax credits and other financial incentives to encourage development of a strong state market for recyclables; and -Establishment of clear definitions of authority and guidelines for solid waste management responsibilities for state agencies implementing the policy.

N2  - Industrial agriculture (IA) is detrimental to the environment, contaminates water and fosters climate change. Moreover, IA cannot guarantee food security for the 21st century. Single-Cell-protein (SCP) represents a safe alternative with minimal carbon and water footprints, but does not truly improve sustainability or food security when grown waste products of IA. This concept paper proposes autotrophic SCP bioprocess designs which enable sustainable, fail-safe and efficient “primary production” of edible biomass from CO2 and N2/NH3, while also providing flexible options of biomass upgrading. It can be driven by H2, CO, HCOOH from several sustainable sources. Most promising designs consist of 2-stages. In the 1st stage, homoacetogenic bacteria (HAB) fix CO2 and secrete fixed C as acetate with unrivaled yields. In the 2nd stage, acetate is transformed to edible biomass by selected microbes. Bacteria have versatile features such as O2-tolerant hydrogenases and N2-fixation. Eukaryotic microalgae are approved as food and exhibit oxygenic photosynthesis (O-PS), partly replacing solar-panels, seawater desalination and H2O-electrolyzers. Photoheterotrophic growth on HAB-derived acetate provides the opportunity to benefit from the highly efficient light-reaction, while avoiding the inefficient dark-reaction. Slow gas mass-transfer, poor light distribution and expensive cell harvest are major challenges arising from the cultivation in liquid media. To cope with these, microbes grow as hydrated biofilms, exposed directly to substrate gases and light. Two such bioreactors are presented and adaptations for 2-stage designs are proposed. One bioreactor was designed for algae growth in wastewater and provides a mechanism of dry cell harvesting. By harvesting microalgae from flowing waters, reduced carbon and nutrients can be obtained, while at the same time counteracting eutrophication. Non-food-grade biomass can be fed to anaerobic digesters (AD) with suppressed methanogenesis. Gaseous H2, CO2, NH3, H2S, CO2 and volatile organic acids can be extracted, with the gas phase acting as a “cleaning” barrier. This makes it possible to safely upgrade non-food-grade biomass to food. When food-grade waste is subjected to hydrolysis, diffusible PVA-tubes piercing the AD may allow simultaneous extraction of basic monomers and precious soluble nutrients. As an additional provision of CO2, alkalic pH and hydroxides formed at the cathode during electrolysis may be used to precipitate CO2 from the air as carbonates. 2stage designs with solar-powered H2 generation from seawater, were estimated to exceed productivity of wheat 20-200 fold. It is speculated that, considering the non-utilization of direct and indirect subsidies, autotrophic SCP is far superior to IA not only in ecological but also in economical aspects. Introduction In 2014, 800 million people suffered from undernourishment (FAO, 2015), and almost 2 billion people suffered from malnutrition (Grebmer et al., 2014). Nowadays, hunger could be largely eliminated by alleviating poverty, by reducing food wastage, and by substantially reducing the significant portion of grains dedicated to animal feed and biofuels (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2013). With today's requirements for food without feed and fuel, even organic farming, which has a low ecological footprint at slightly lower yields, could potentially provide enough food for the majority, or even the entirety, of the world population (Badgley et al., 2007; Connor, 2008). However, the world's population is expected to grow to about 9 billion by 2050 and will require 60-100% more food (Godfray et al., 2010). The demand of meat, dairy products and biofuels are also projected to increase, not only in total quantity, but also in relative shares of agricultural production (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). Unlike the previous decades, production of industrial agriculture (IA) is not expected to increase substantially due to climate change impacts in tropical, as well as in temperate climates (Challinor et al., 2014; Thornton, 2012; Wheeler and Braun, 2013). Food security is threatened by poor harvests and even crop failures that are becoming more likely due to climate change impacts, such as droughts and flooding, freshwater scarcity, pollinator decline, soil salinization due to inadequate irrigation and other forms of environmental degradation. The most important resource, freshwater, is already urgently lacking in many countries and is becoming increasingly unreliable and scarce (Connor, 2015). IA is likely to partly counteract these challenges by intensifying irrigation, application of fertilizers and pesticides, and by transforming more land into monocultures. Each of these measures has already PeerJ PrePrints | https://dx.doi.org/10.7287/peerj.preprints.1279v1 | CC-BY 4.0 Open Access | rec: 3 Aug 2015, publ: 3 Aug 2015 P re P rin ts had profound negative effects on freshwater resources, the ecosystem, climate change, public health and society. While the overall IA output has been doubled in the last decades, the scale of these side effects has been often found to grow at a significantly greater rate (Galloway et al., 2003; Van Grinsven et al., 2013; Tilman, 1999). Side effects are expected to increase faster with further IA gains, in the case of N-fertilizers even exponentially (Shcherbak et al., 2014). N-fertilizers (for simplicity referred to as fertilizer) are a comprehensive example of IA-associated effects: Commercial production by Haber-Bosch consumes large amounts of fossil-fuels, causing about 1-2% of all greenhouse gases. Nitrogen use efficiency of common crops is below 50% (Lassaletta et al., 2014), and the remaining half of fertilizer has various destinies: it is partly washed out, causing eutrophication, it is partly transformed to the highly potent greenhouse gases N2 O, and it is partly degraded to nitrate or NO2 which deteriorate public health (Galloway et al., 2003). Estimates of the annual cost of pollution by agricultural fertilizer range between 35-230 billion €, which is more than the economic benefit of fertilizers in agriculture (Van Grinsven et al., 2013). Counterintuitively, a surplus of nutrients entails a loss in biodiversity and ecosystem services. As an extreme example of the impacts of eutrophication, dozens of thousands of square kilometers of the baltic sea are hypoxic and unable to sustain O2-dependent marine life (Carstensen et al., 2014). The numerous environmental and social impacts of IA cannot be treated here comprehensively. However, among the most incisive, the destruction of forests and the drainage of moors, and the subsequent transformation into monocultures, causes significant loss of biodiversity and seriously affects the natural capacity of the biosphere to adapt to climate change impacts now and in the future. Last but not least, IA alone causes up to 29 % of all greenhouse gases (Vermeulen et al., 2012). Besides the unsustainable practices of IA, plants in general have inherent drawbacks that make them rather unsuitable as the only means of food production: 1. very high blue-green water footprint (irrigation, surface, ground and rain water). Global averages of common crops reach about 1.8 m3 of water per ton crop (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2014). 2. high vulnerability to abiotic stress such as drought, flooding and salinity. 3. High vulnerability to biotic stress, such as insects, weeds and fungal pests. Agroindustrial monocultures favor pests and require extensive pesticide treatment. Pesticide toxic to farmers and the surrounding environment in a wide radius through run-off and aquifer contamination. 4. inedibility of a large fraction of the plant such as ligneous stem, leaves and roots. 5. indigestibility of a fraction of edible biomass, such as cellulose. 6. Low efficiency of the Calvin-Benson-BasshamCycle (CBB) of CO2-fixation (CF). CBB is a major sink of energy in plants and also acts as a valve for excess energy. CBB requires several times more ATP than anaerobic prokaryotic pathways (Bar-Even et al., 2010). Due to the oxygenase side reaction of the CBB key enzyme RubisCO, evolved O2 can further degrade the efficiency of CBB (photorespiration). 7. Low productivity per surface and time. Global average of cereal productivity amounted to a mere 0,39 kg/m2 in 2013 (Faostat, 2015). 8. To meet an increasing demand, increased requirements for arable land are met by forest clearing and moor draining, during which biodiversity is destroyed and substantial amounts of GHG are released. 9. high dependency on nitrogen fertilizer with the mentioned high impacts of production and degradation. 10. strict dependency on light as the only possible energy source. Biomass formation is limited to daylight hours and parts of the day's production are consumed outside daylight hours. 11. limitation to CO2 as the only carbon source, excluding usage of organic wastes. Single-Cell-Protein as alternative food source Because of the inherent drawbacks of plant-based food production, this work concentrates on edible microorganisms or “single-cell-protein” (SCP) for the production of raw food material. SCP has several advantages: 1. it grows several orders of magnitude faster than

N2  - reference. Presents translational The Indian Nitrogen Assessment The increasing population densities of Asia, Africa and Oceania are in conflict with the ecosystem. A growing demand for food and fiber causes agriculture to rely heavily upon chemical fertilization, herbicides and pesticides. Rising industrial output creates higher contamination from cadmium, lead, selenium, and other metals. Soils and Groundwater Remediation explores the toxic levels of metals, radionuclides, inorganics, and anthropogenic organic compounds found in the soils and groundwater of Asia, Africa and Oceania. This 14 chapter book reviews the distribution, transformation, and dynamics of the pollutants. The authors also reflect on the impact of Acid-rain. The contributors to this book are well-known scientists from Japan, China, Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia, and Kenya. The authors address their findings to researchers, educators, government regulators, and students. As the title suggests, the book is ultimately concerned with remediation. Huang and Iskandar feel "the potential for restoring ecosystem health in these areas is enormous." The contributions of Soils and Groundwater Remediation will bring science closer to achieving that possibility. the that within the upon to the new examine a and a base that allows readers to where in made and how met. existing systems against definitions of and pinpoint those areas where can be made in current systems to further concepts of soil functions to be related to specific purposes. Managing soil quality takes a management oriented approach by identifying key issues in soil quality and management options to enhance the sustainability of modern agriculture. Topics covered include major plant nutrients (N, P, K), soil acidity, soil organic matter, soil biodiversity, soil compaction, erosion, pesticides and urban waste. Sustainable Agriculture Systems This book presents a comprehensive and up-to-date overview on soils of Taiwan. It includes sections on soil research history, climate, geology, geomorphology, major soil types, soil maps, soil properties, soil classification, soil fertility, land use and vegetation, soil management, soils and humans, soils and industry, future soil issues. The book summarizes what is known about the soils in Taiwan in a concise and highly reader-friendly way. Agronomy the agricultural, commercial, and ecological future of plants in relation to mineral nutrition. It covers various topics regarding the role and importance of mineral nutrition in plants including essentiality, availability, applications, as well as their management and control strategies. Plants and plant products are increasingly important sources for the production of energy, biofuels, and biopolymers in order to replace the use of fossil fuels. The maximum genetic potential of plants can be realized successfully with a balanced mineral nutrients supply. This book explores efficient nutrient management strategies that tackle the over and under use of nutrients, check different kinds of losses from the system, and improve use efficiency of the plants. Applied and basic aspects of ecophysiology, biochemistry, and biotechnology have been adequately incorporated including pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, agronomical, breeding and plant protection parameters, propagation and nutrients managements. This book will serve not only as an excellent reference material but also as a practical guide for readers, cultivators, students, botanists, entrepreneurs, and farmers. Unfortunately, most of the world’s agriculture is still reactionary, waiting for obvious yield declines to occur before taking action to identify the reasons. The modern soil laboratory is pivotal to informing soil managers what adaptive practices are needed to address chemical and physical imbalances before they occur, and the intelligent adaptive use of laboratory data not greatly speeds up and reduces the cost of empirical soil study, but can even render it unnecessary. This book provides a synopsis of the analytical procedures used for soil analysis, discussing the common physical, chemical and biological analytical methods used in agriculture and horticulture. Written by experienced experts from institutions and laboratories around the globe, it provides insights for a range of users, including those with limited laboratory facilities, and helps students, teachers, soil scientists and laboratory technicians increase their knowledge and skills and select appropriate methods for soil analysis. Quality while the broader range of environmental farming National policymakers who try to answer this question confront difficult trade-offs. This book offers four specific strategies that can serve as the basis for a national policy to protect soil and water quality while maintaining U.S. agricultural productivity and competitiveness. Timely and comprehensive, the volume has important implications for the Clean Air Act and the 1995 farm bill. Advocating a systems approach, the committee recommends specific farm practices and new approaches to prevention of soil degradation and water pollution for environmental agencies. The volume details methods of evaluating soil management systems and offers a wealth of information on improved management of nitrogen, phosphorus, manure, pesticides, sediments, salt, and trace elements. Landscape analysis of nonpoint source pollution is also detailed. Drawing together research findings, survey results, and case examples, the volume will be of interest to federal, state, and local policymakers; state and local environmental and agricultural officials and other environmental and agricultural specialists; scientists involved in soil and water issues; researchers; and agricultural producers. and a complete, and up-to-date treatment of the subject matter compiled by leading scientists. It is a resource rich in data, offering professional soil scientists, agronomists, biologists, naturalists, and students their first point of entry into a particular aspect of the soil sciences. Quality Laboratory Methods for Soil Health Analysis Analyzing, comparing, and understanding soil health data The maintenance of healthy soil resources is instrumental to the success of an array of global efforts and initiatives. Whether they are working to combat food shortages, conserve our ecosystems, or mitigate the impact of climate change, researchers and agriculturalists the world over must be able to correctly examine and understand the complex nature of this essential resource. These new volumes have been designed to meet this need, addressing the many dimensions of soil health analysis in chapters that are concise, accessible and applicable to the tasks at hand. Soil Health, Volume Two: Laboratory Methods for Soil Health Analysis provides explanations of the best practices by which one may arrive at valuable, comparable data and incisive conclusions, and covers topics including: Sampling considerations and field evaluations Assessment and interpretation of soil-test biological activity Macro- and micronutrients in soil quality and health PLFA and EL-FAME indicators Offering a practical guide to collecting and understanding soil health data, this volume will be of great interest to all those working in agriculture, private sector businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academic-, state-, and federal-research projects, as well as state and federal soil conservation, water quality and other environmental programs. and factually supported exploration of the problem at hand and the critical steps needed to reverse it.

And that these problems are rooted in land misuse and soil mismanagement. This book does provide policymakers and others with an understanding of the depth, complexity, and immediacy of this crisis, but more than a call to action, it also offers soil scientists working in this area with an understanding of what is being done and what needs to be done. Most importantly, this book helps us understand that the situation is not beyond remediation were we to act with great resolve and a sense of urgency. A tree's leaves may be ever so good, So may its bark, so may its wood; But unless you put the right thing to its root, It never will show much flower or fruit. — from Leaves Compared With Flowers, by Robert Frost Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Sustainable Development Soil degradation causes a shrinking of arable land resources, and the persistence of starvation and malnutrition. The depletion is compounded by the increasing populations of developing tropical nations, and the conversion of agricultural land to other uses. As a result, per capita grain harvesting and irrigated land is in steady decline all over the world. The decrease in horticultural resources and productivity has inspired Soil Quality and Agricultural Sustainability, which is based primarily on papers presented at the 1996 conference on soil degradation, sponsored by Ohio State University, the USAID and the International Agricultural Research Centers.

N2  - Heavy metal pollution of the environment through anthropogenic and natural processes are expanded in a serious problem. Heavy metals are elements in the predict table they have high atomic weight, atomic number and atomic densities higher than 4 g/cm3, among those metals lead, cadmium, zinc, mercury, arsenic, silver, chromium, copper, iron, platinum and others. Toxic heavy metal contamination of food crops is a big concern global world mainly in developing country like Ethiopia. Ultimately, heavy metal toxicity and disease in human and animals are because of conception of heavy metal contaminated soil, food and air. The huge amount environmental contamination by toxic heavy metals are dangerous because of their uptake by plants and subsequent accumulation in food crops consumed by animals and humans is deleterious to heath. There are many known source of toxic heavy metals including the nature, which releases in to the food, air and water, and human activities like fertilizer application in agricultural farm, the use of herbicides and pesticide and wastewater irrigation. Other sources of heavy metals in environment are smoking, automobile emission, industries, swage and waste disposal. Most studies showed that vegetables and other food crops consumed in Ethiopia are contaminated by heavy metals this is associated with adverse health issues such as cancer, which is currently serious in Ethiopia. It is therefore a big concern based on those issues the communities to avoid the conception of heavy metal contaminated food items. There is also need monitoring of the levels of heavy metals in food crops and precaution of heavy metal controlling methods.

N2  - Introduction The need to safeguard global food supply has led to an increasing use of chemical pesticides during the last 60 Years. However, this need should be balanced with our responsibil­ ity also to safeguard human and environmental health. By definition, chemical pesticides are toxic compounds and can become pollutants of soil, water and air after their applica­ tion. Such pollution can lead to human risk pathways, e.g. by the presence of pesticide residues in the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we breathe. Once applied to the surface or subsurface of a soil, the fate of a pesticide compound is governed by its decomposition/degradation, its adsorption onto the solid phase of the soil, its dissolution in the liquid phase with subsequent movement by leaching, and its volatili­ zation to the gas phase with subsequent diffusion through soil pores and/or emission to the atmosphere. Together with envi­ ronmental variables (e.g. temperature, soil type and structure, soil moisture content), the physical and chemical properties of individual pesticides dictate the extent to which each of these processes acts upon a given compound. The potential for air contamination depends on the extent to which the pesticide converts to the gaseous state, i.e. its volatility. For some pesti­ cides (e.g. the class known as fumigants), almost 100% of the chemical mass is potentially volatile under field conditions . In such a scenario, the potential for emissions from soil, and therefore air contamination, is very high. Research to under­ stand the processes controlling pesticide emissions better can lead to the development of strategies that reduce these emis­ sions; thereby assisting farmers in the protection of air quality and compliance with increas ingly stringent air quality regula­ tions. This article describes the extent of pesticide emissions from soil, the environmental and human health concerns of these emissions, and the efforts being made to predict these emissions using model simulations.

N2  - The efficiency of agricultural resources use is a concern especially in the developing world where production is common on fragile lands and characterized by low productivity, small-scale subsistence farming, and acute susceptibility to changes in weather. There is a need for a better understanding of factors influencing variations in efficiency among smallholder farmers. This study was conducted with the aim of estimating technical and economic efficiencies of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L) producing farmers and to identify factors affecting resources use efficiency. A sample of 179 tomato producers who can irrigate their crop were used. To estimate technical and economic efficiencies a Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier model was used; a Tobit model was used to analyze factors affecting tomato production under irrigation. Farmers producing tomato under irrigation were technically inefficient in using inputs of labor and seed and they were not cost efficient in using inputs of land, labor, seed, and fertilizer. Average levels of technical and economic efficiency of tomato farmers were 0.75 and 0.67, respectively. Degree of education, experience in tomato production, and application of pesticides were variables affecting technical and economic efficiencies positively. There are opportunities to optimize utilization of resources by tomato farmers.

N2  - Adoption of herbicides by Ethiopian smallholders has grown rapidly, with application on cereals doubling to more than a quarter of the area under cereals between 2004 and 2014. Relying on unique data from a large-scale survey of producers of teff, the most widely grown cereal in Ethiopia, we find considerable positive labor productivity effects of herbicide use of between 9 and 18 per cent. We show that the adoption of herbicides is strongly related to proximity to urban centers, access to all-weather roads, and levels of local rural wages. All these factors have changed substantially over the last decade in Ethiopia, explaining the rapid take-off in herbicide adoption. The sizable increase in herbicide use in Ethiopia has important implications for rural labor markets, potential environmental and health considerations, and capacity development for the design and effective implementation of regulatory policies on herbicides.Cet article étudie l'utilisation des herbicides en Éthiopie. Il révèle une augmentation rapide des importations d'herbicides dans le secteur privé en Ethiopie (une valeur quadruplée au cours de la dernière décennie). L'adoption des herbicides par les petits exploitants a augmenté rapidement, en particulier l'application dans le domaine des céréales qui a plus que doublé au cours des dix dernières années, attenant plus d'un quart de ce secteur en 2014. Nous constatons d'importants effets positifs sur la productivité du travail pour ceux qui adoptent de 9 à 18 pourcent. Nous montrons que l'adoption des herbicides est fortement liée à la proximité d'une ville, aux salaires ruraux, et à l'accès aux marchés. Tous ces facteurs ont considérablement changés au cours de la dernière décennie en Éthiopie, ce qui semble expliquer la popularité de l'adoption des herbicides. Ce changement a des répercussions importantes sur les marchés du travail ruraux, sur les considérations potentielles en matière d'environnement et de la santé, et sur les besoins en matière de renforcement des capacités pour la conception et la mise en œuvre de politiques réglementaires.

N2  - A portable and time-integrating field sampler based on the supported liquid membrane (SLM) extraction technique was constructed. Using two programmable syringe pumps and one programmable valve, the sampler could carry out automatic unattended extraction for up to seven extracts, combining the steps of sampling, trace enrichment and clean-up. The sampler was applied to the extraction of four s-triazine herbicides (atrazine, cyanazine, prometryn and terbutryn) and six major degradation products of s-triazines, including three dealkylated products (deethyl deisopropyl atrazine (DDA), deisopropyl atrazine DIA and deethyl atrazine (DEA)) and three hydroxylated products (hydroxy atrazine (ATOH), hydroxy propazine (PROH) and hydroxy terbutylazine (TZOH)). The donor solution was obtained by mixing sample and buffer, consisting of 1Mphosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 1.7M NaCl, in the ratio of 19: 1 (v/v). Extraction was performed by continuously pumping 10mL portions of donor along the SLM until 3 L of sample had been extracted. The SLM consisted of di-n-hexylether and the acceptor was 1M HCl. After extract collection, extracts were neutralised with NaOH and buffered with phosphate. Extracts were analysed with HPLC, using a gradient elution consisting of 3.5mM phosphate and acetonitrile and UV-detection at 220 nm. Enrichment factors in reagent water ranged from 1.3 (for DIA) to 2739 (for terbutryn). The developed field sampler was tested by carrying out 24-h time-weighted on-site extraction of the ten striazine target compounds in Hawassa Lake and its tributary river, located in the agricultural region of the Southern Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Atrazine, cyanazine and terbutryn were generally below the method detection limit, while prometryn was frequently found. Overall, s-triazines were not persistent in the studied environment and degradation products of s-triazines were found in higher concentrations than the parent herbicides in both the river and the lake. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter] is the most important cereal crop in Ethiopia, where it is the number one in terms of acreage covering 30% of the total area allocated to cereal crops. The crop is preferred both by farmers and consumers. Farmers benefit since it is tolerant to many extreme environmental conditions including water-logging and storage pests. Consumers prefer tef not only because it makes good quality bread, but also it is free of gluten for which some people are allergic. Hence, tef plays a vital role in food security, nutrition, and income generation to resource poor farmers. Despite its importance tef produces the lowest yield compared to other cereals due mainly to the widespread use of landraces and cultivars lacking desirable agronomic traits. The susceptibility of the plant to lodging caused by wind and rain contributes for significant yield loss in tef. Since the start of research in tef five decades ago, 35 improved varieties were released to the farming community although only few of the recently released varieties received high adoption by growers. The national average yield of tef doubled in the last 20 years due mainly to the increased use of inputs that include improved seeds, fertilizers and herbicides. In this review, we present some progresses made in tef research and dissemination of technologies to the farming community. In addition, we indicate the future perspectives of improving this vital crop that feeds 50 million people in the Horn of Africa.

N2  - Limited information exists on postharvest preservation strategies of stored wheat in Ethiopia. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of on-the shelf postharvest storage strategies of stored wheat in the country. The experiment consisted of eight treatments; (1) metal silos, (2) Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags, (3) Super GrainPro bags, (4) industrial filter cake dust applied to wheat in polypropylene bag, (5) plastic drums, 6) Triplex applied to wheat in polypropylene bag, 7) Triplex applied to wheat in plastic drum, and 8) polypropylene bag as control. Measurements of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, live adults of insects per kg, percentage seed damage, and percentage of weight loss, germination and seedling vigor were determined every two months for six months. Results indicated that storage strategies such as PICS and Super GrainPro bags, filter cake, Triplex, and plastic drums led to a significantly lower live insect density compared to the control. Besides, Triplex and filter cake dust or use of hermetic bags also resulted in a significantly lower rate of seed weight loss (%) compared to the control. After six months of storage, means ± SD germination of seed from the polypropylene bag (control) had decreased to 68.0 ± 6.1% while wheat in all other storage strategies exhibited means ± SD germination capacity ranging from 92.0 ± 3.6% to 98.0 ± 1.0%. The present results demonstrate the potential of preserving stored wheat without relying on synthetic insecticides by using hermetic bags, filter cake, and Triplex, with advantages over traditional strategies used by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. We recommend that hermetic bags, filter cake dust, and Triplex powder should be promoted for use by farmers for the postharvest preservation of their stored wheat.

N2  - Lathyrus sativus L. (Leguminosae) seed, commonly known as khesari, is an important legume in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and Ethiopia. Ten free fatty acids were identified in seed coat waxes of four varieties of L. sativus with total fatty acids accounting for between 10.5 and 17.4 mg per 100 g of seed depending on the variety. Palmitoleic acid (C16:1) was the predominant free fatty acid in two of the varieties; whereas palmitic (C16:0) and lauric (C12:0) acids were the predominant free fatty acids in the two other varieties. Attraction of free fatty acids from seed coat waxes of the four varieties were tested for attractiveness to females of Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) (Coleoptera: Bruchidae) at 2-8, 2-8, 4-8, and 4-8 μg concentrations, respectively, in Y-tube olfactometer bioassays. The attractiveness of synthetic mixtures comparable to the fatty acid compositions of the four varieties were also tested. Individual synthetic myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, and stearic acids at 0.66, 1.18, 1.36, and 1.18 μg, respectively, elicited attraction of the insect. A synthetic blend of 0.93, 1.68, 1.82, and 1.18 μg of myristic, palmitic, palmitoleic, and stearic acids, respectively, was most attractive to the insect. At present, C. maculatus are controlled with insecticides, which are harmful to human health and environment. Hence, the above mentioned combination of four fatty acids might be used for insect pest management such as baited traps.

N2  - Parthenium is a competitive weed spreading in tropical countries. Field experiments were conducted to compare the effect of hand hoeing, growing a smother crop, and applying a herbicide (2,4-D) on parthenium growth and on yield of grain sorghum in smallholder farming systems in eastern Ethiopia. Hand hoeing twice and a smother crop (cowpea) in combination with hand hoeing once consistently suppressed parthenium at the experimental sites. Application of 2,4-D provided inconsistent control of parthenium, possibly because of reemergence from the soil seed bank after control. Growing cowpea as the smother crop suppressed parthenium, but sorghum grain and stalk yields were reduced even when the smother crop was combined with hoeing. Hand hoeing twice, 4 and 8 wk after emergence of sorghum, consistently resulted in better yields than application of 2,4- D and growing smother crop. It is possible that hoeing, apart from controlling the weed, also created better soil conditions for rain water infiltration.

N2  - The flower industry in East Africa has grown in recent years, especially in the production and export of roses. The aim of this study was to assess pesticide use on selected flower farms in Ethiopia. Serum cholinesterase levels in workers were used as a marker of pesticide exposure. This study was a cross-sectional study involving 588 workers from 15 different flower farms. It had a response rate of 95.5%. The participants included 277 males (mean age 26 years; 148 pesticide sprayers and 129 non-sprayers) and 311 females (mean age 25 years; 156 working in greenhouses and 155 working outside the greenhouses). The researchers undertook structured interviews, blood sampling, and walkthrough surveys. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression were used in the statistical analyses. A total of 154 different trade names of pesticides were found. Of them, 31 (27%) were classified as moderately hazardous by the WHO, and 9% were organophosphates. Serum levels of cholinesterase deviating from 50–140 Michel units were considered abnormal. Abnormal serum cholinesterase levels (above 140 Michel units) were found in 97 participants (16.5%, 95% confidence interval 13.7%–19.7%). There were no differences between the four job groups regarding cholinesterase levels. The high prevalence of abnormal serum cholinesterase levels might indicate the presence of pesticide intoxication. Thus, there is a need for routine monitoring of all workers exposed to pesticides, not only sprayers.

N2  - Sesame is an important oil crop for the Ethiopian economy. However, the lack of adequate storage facilities results in significant losses of sesame seeds. This study was designed to compare the effects of storage conditions and the subsequent impact on sesame seed germination, mold growth, and mycotoxin accumulation over the storage period. The efficacy of two hermetic bags (1. Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags and 2. Super GrainPro (SGP) bags) was directly compared to sesame storage in polypropylene (PP bags) and Jute bags. Storage conditions (oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature, moisture content and relative humidity) of samples were analyzed in the laboratory in three replicates. Results showed that the oxygen concentrations dropped to 6.9% (±0.02) in PICS bags and 8.7% (±0.06) in SGP bags at the end of 6 months of storage. In non-hermetic bags Jute and PP), oxygen levels were close to atmospheric levels at 2-, 4-, and 6-month storage periods. In non-hermetic bags throughout storage, the amount of seed infection by mold constantly increased, and seed germination decreased. Sesame seeds stored in hermetic bags had 89.7% (±0.58) to 88.3% (±2.89) germination rates versus 61.67% (±2.08) for non-hermetic storage bags over the 6-month seed storage period. All mycotoxin levels increased over the same storage period, whereas comparative levels were much lower in hermetic bags after six months. Sesame seeds stored in both hermetic bags had the lowest level of tested mycotoxins, and levels among the SGP and PICS bags were not significantly different from one another. This study provides strong evidence indicating that hermetic storage structures such as PICS and SGP significantly affect temperature, humidity, moisture content, CO2 and oxygen levels resulting in the lowering of fungal growth and mycotoxin accumulation and effectively preserving stored sesame without relying on synthetic pesticides in Ethiopia.

N2  - This study aimed to determine the level of heavy metals in the Holeta and Golli rivers and their impacts on the community of Holeta town, Ethiopia. Water samples were collected from eight randomly selected locations (4 sites from each river). A questionnaire survey, FGD, and KII were also used. Secondary data were also taken from the nearby health center. The flame atomic absorption spectrometer was used to analyze the samples. Fe, Mn, Ni, Cr, Pb, Cu, Zn, Co, and Cd were the identified heavy metals. The Holeta River contains Fe > Mn > Zn > Ni > Cr > Cu > Pb > Co > Cd, whereas the Golli River contains Fe > Mn > Zn > Ni > Cr > Cu > Pb > Co > Cd. The levels of Fe, Cr, Ni, Fe, and Mn were above the permissible limit of WHO (1984) and USEPA (1992). The primary sources of income for the people who lived in the area were farming and jobs on flower farms. Wastewaters discharged from the surrounding flower farms were the major polluting source (84.3%) of the river. About 84.3% of the surrounding community claimed that wastewaters discharged from the flower farms are the major polluting sources of both rivers. Many of the flower farmworkers (43.9%) have also exposure to toxic insecticides and pesticides used on the farm. About 60% and 20.5% of the workers have frequent severe headaches and skin irritation due to exposure to heavy metals. Generally, both the surrounding community and flower farmworkers are facing significant health and socioeconomic impacts due to the heavy metals joining the rivers. Therefore, effective management of pollution sources and continuous monitoring of the river quality is very imperative to minimize the impacts.

N2  - The study was conducted in Kafa and Benchi-Sheko zones with an intention to identify types of pesticides, their utilization, and impacts on beekeeping. Purposive sampling was used for study sites selection. Accordingly, a total of four districts from two zones: Debub Benchi and Guraferda from Benchi Sheko Zone; Chena and Gimbo districts from Kafa zone were selected. Three peasant associations (PAs) were purposively selected from each district based on their pesticide utilization and agro-ecologies. Available data were collected through conducting questionnaire survey with farmers and key informants’ interviews (KII). In addition, focus group discussions (FGDs) and field observations were undertaken to exploit the necessary information on the types of pesticides, their supplies or marketing, and overall cares taken during utilization. However, to assess the utilization status among vast users (farmers) and comparing the general utilization status of two farmer groups: beekeepers and non-beekeepers, a formative survey data was collected from both groups (containing 180 respondents each). In the areas, a total of 12-types of pesticides: Roundup (Isopropylamine salt of glyphosate), 2,4-D (2.4-Dichloro-phenoxy acetic acid), Malathion (Carbaryl 0.3%, malathion 6%, Captan-12%), Diazinon (Phosphorothiota-48%), Ridomil (Metalaxyl-M40g/kg, Mancozeb 640%g/kg), Mancozeb (Mn2+15%, Zn 2+2%, C4H6N2S4-58%), Profit (Tricyclazole-75%),Agrolambacin (Profenos 30%, Lambda-Cyhalothrin-2%),Matico (Fluoxastrobin-18%,Tebuconazole-25%), Sevin (Carbaryl-22.5%), Imidacloprid (Imidacloprid 2.5%, Imidazolidi nimine-75%), and Karate (Lambda-Cyhalothrin 1.22%) were found to be used in the areas for controlling various crops’ and animals’ pests and diseases. Of which, 2,4-D and Roundups are widely used for controlling various weeds. About 68.9% of the respondents, use pesticide with significantly higher number of non-beekeepers (73.9%) using pesticides than beekeepers (63.9%) at p < 0.05. Illegal traders, legal traders, and Governmental Organizations were major sources of pesticides sharing 53%, 30%, and 17%, respectively. Utilization level of pesticides was higher in lowlands compared to midland and highland areas. Though most farmers have knowhow on side effects of pesticides, the overall cares taken before, during and after application of pesticides were very less. Data from 180 interviewee beekeepers indicated that a total of 15,644 kg honey estimated to be 62,576 USD lost due to dwindled (1015), absconded (482), and Dead (112) colonies. This revealed an ever-increasing utilization trend accompanied with unrestricted introduction and minimum cares taken resulting for subsequent economic loses from beekeeping subsector as we as pollination services unless a well-designed winning mitigation options undertaken.

N2  - Farmers continue losing substantial quantities of grain during storage due to damages from pests including insects. Hermetic bags, being promoted in Ethiopia, could be viable alternatives to traditional methods and insecticides that are commonly used by farmers to store grain. However, the economics and determinants behind farmers' decisions to use different storage methods are poorly understood. This study sought to ascertain the economics of hermetic grain storage technology among 450 representative small-scale maize farmers in northwestern Ethiopia. Gross margin (GM), and the marginal rate of return (MRR) were employed to estimate the economic costs and benefits of storage methods, while a multivariate probit regression model was employed to analyze the determinants of farmers' decision to store maize with a given storage method. The results show that farmers used a combination of different storage techniques: 19.6% did not store grain, 87.8% used traditional methods with pesticide, and 66.7% used Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) hermetic bags. Farmers who used hermetic bags also used other mentioned storage techniques. PICS had the highest GM (US$21.77 100 kg−1) and MRR (3.196), indicating that they were the most profitable. Moreover, a household could obtain an additional net cash flow of US$5.02 100 kg−1 PICS bag per season after 9.6 months of storage. Farmers’ decisions to use PICS bags were influenced by several factors including access to information, the initial cost, and storage capacity of the technology. Thus, increasing awareness and improving supply chain efficiency to reduce the cost of the PICS bags would improve adoption rates.

N2  - Several hundred cases of Hirmi Valley Liver Disease (HVLD), an often fatal liver injury, occurred from 2001 to 2011 in a cluster of rural villages in Tigray, Ethiopia. HVLD is principally caused by contamination of the food supply with plant derived pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), with high exposure to the pesticide DDT among villagers increasing their susceptibility. In an untargeted global approach we aimed to identify metabolic changes induced by PA exposure through 1H NMR spectroscopic based metabolic profiling. We analysed spectra acquired from urine collected from HVLD cases and controls and a murine model of PA exposure and PA/DDT co-exposure, using multivariate partial least squares discriminant analysis. In the human models we identified changes in urinary concentrations of tyrosine, pyruvate, bile acids, N-acetylglycoproteins, N-methylnicotinamide and formate, hippurate, p-cresol sulphate, p-hydroxybenzoate and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid. Tyrosine and p-cresol sulphate were associated with both exposure and disease. Similar changes to tyrosine, one-carbon intermediates and microbial associated metabolites were observed in the mouse model, with tyrosine correlated with the extent of liver damage. These results provide mechanistic insight and implicate the gut microflora in the human response to challenge with toxins. Pathways identified here may be useful in translational research and as exposome signals.

N2  - Objective: This study aims to assess the prevalence of pesticide use and its occupational exposure among small-scale farmers in the Kellem Wellega Zone of western Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study design using a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 249 small-scale farmers’ households through face-to-face interviews. Statistical analysis such as descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and binary logistic regression analysis was applied, and a P-value <.05 at 95% CI was considered statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of pesticide use was 87.15%. About 44.2%, 40.2%, and 43.8% of the study participants were classified as having poor knowledge, poor practice, and negative attitude toward pesticide use, respectively. Thus, small-scale farmers whose age was greater than 40 years were 7.87 times more likely to be exposed to skin irritation than those whose age was less than 20 years (AOR = 7.87; 95% CI: 1.75-35.45) and skin contact (AOR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15-0.91). Most farmers who were directly involved in agriculture were 2.22 times more likely to be exposed to the inhalation of pesticide chemicals than those involved in another activity (AOR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.14-4.33). Based on educational level, small-scale farmers who have a primary school and above were 81% less likely to inhale pesticide chemicals than those who did not have formal education (AOR = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.09-0.41). Furthermore, low-income small-scale farmers were 2.62 times more likely to be exposed to coughing (AOR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.25-5.51) than high-income participants. Furthermore, farmers with good knowledge were 1.79 times more likely to be exposed to skin irritation than those with poor knowledge (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.0-3.17). Farmers with poor practice were 1.85 times more likely to show coughing symptoms than those with good practice (AOR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08-3.2), and farmers with good practice were 48% less likely to be exposed to headache than those with poor practice (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.31-0.88). Conclusions: This study shows that small-scale farmers were exposed to pesticides through coughing, headache, skin irritation, inhalation, and skin contact. Low level of knowledge, poor practice, job, low income, older age, and educational level.

The Montreal accords of 1987 to limit the production of chlorofluorocarbons and the UN call for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war were steps in this direction. But a look at the "vital signs" of the earth as expressed by environmental crises will show how much more is needed. Deforestation for agriculture and logging causes as estimated loss of 11 million hectares of forest each year. Deforestation means erosion. The topsoil layer once 6-10 inches deep over the globe is being blown or washed away at the rate of 26 billion tons a year. The soil is not only being depleted it is being contaminated by agricultural pesticides and toxic wastes. In Poland for example 1/4 of the soil is unfit for food production and only 1% of the water is safe for drinking due to chemical contamination. The depletion of the ozone layer is no longer observed only in Antarctica; it has dropped up to 9% in North Dakota Maine and Switzerland. The loss of forests and the acidification of lakes and soil are causing whole species to become extinct. World population continues to grow as each year 80 million more people are born than die. But the real problem is not population growth per se; it is the relationship between population size and the sustainable yield of local forests grasslands and croplands. In 1982 Indias forests could sustain an annual harvest of 30 million tons of wood; the estimated demand was 133 million tons. In 9 Southern African countries the number of cattle exceed the carrying capacity of the grasslands by 50% to 100%. In India enough fodder is raised to supply only 50% to 80% of the needs of cattle. The results of deforestation overgrazing and overplowing is desertification which compounded by drought brings famine. The relationship between population growth and land degradation is reflected in per capita food production. In China it has risen by 1/3 since 1970 but in Africa it has fallen by 1/5; and India despite the Green Revolution will have to import grain if there is another failure of the monsoons. Another indicator of environmental ill-health is energy consumption which is again on the rise. Industrial use of oil and coal especially in the US the USSR and China has resulted in air pollution and acid rain which by September 1987 had damaged 30.7 million hectares of forests in Europe. But by far the most serious result of the burning of fossil fuels and wood is the 7 billion tons of carbon discharged annually into the atmosphere causing the greenhouse effect which will raise the global temperature between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius by year 2050. Patterns of World settlement and agriculture will change drastically; irrigation and drainage systems will have to be adjusted; and a rise in sea levels between 1.4 and 2.2 meters by year 2100 could inundate coastal cities. In view of these deteriorating "vital signs" of the planet nations must work together to turn one earth into one world. The Montreal accord on ozone protection and the 1987 US-Soviet arms limitation were a good beginning. The greenhouse effect and the changing climate are logical candidates for the next round of world environmental deliberations.

N2  - Grass pea Lathyrus sativus L. plays a major role in the nutrition of many poor people in Ethiopia. However, the crop suffers heavy damage by pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum (Hemiptera: Aphididae). To test potentially more sustainable and harmless alternatives to the commonly used insecticides, some botanicals (neem, garlic and hot pepper), soap, kerosene and the aphicide pirimicarb, were tested for their efficacy against A. pisum at Wondata village, close to the town of Bahir Dar, in northwestern Ethiopia, from 1999 to 2002. After pirimicarb, hot pepper was consistently the most effective botanical in controlling the pea aphid in terms of both pea aphid population as well as grain yield. Compared to the untreated control, there was up to 83 and 55% lower aphid population on pirimicarb- and hot pepper-treated plots in the 2000/2001 cropping season, respectively. There was also up to 93 and 54% higher grain yield on plots treated with pirimicarb and hot pepper extract, respectively. Soap was less effective, while kerosene caused phytotoxicity. Infestation levels increased with advancing maturity of the crop, rising exceptionally suddenly and dramatically near crop maturity. Combined ANOVA over years and crop growth stages indicated that aphid populations varied with years and growth stages. In 2001/2002, aphid populations were higher and grain yields were lower compared with the other years. Percentage parasitism of aphids was significantly higher on pirimicarb-treated plots (∼40%) than other treatments (<20%). Parasitism was essentially a late-season occurrence. Predator population, especially of ladybird beetles (Adonia spp.), was especially higher on hot pepper- and garlic-treated plots, and lowest on pirimicarb treated plots. Grain yield was positively correlated with level of aphid parasitism, ladybird beetle population and number of pods per plant, and strongly negatively correlated with aphid population. In conclusion, a fresh extract of hot pepper sprayed at the rate of 70 ml/4 m2 was selected for further research on rate, frequency and cost of application. © ICIPE 2004.

N2  - The Act of 27 April 2001 – Environmental protection law (Journal of Laws 2001 No. 62, item 627) defi nes soil as the upper part of the lithosphere, which consists of a mineral part, an organic part, soil water, soil air and organisms, covering the top part of the ground and subsoil [4].The soil-forming process is very slow, therefore soil resources are basically regarded as non-renewable. Among the basic functions of soil in on-land ecosystems mainly are fi ltering and buff ering activity, protection against excessive fl ow of various elements and compounds as well as substances of anthropogenic origin to other elements of biosphere, mainly waters and plants. Soil is a source of food, biomass, raw minerals and is a platform for landscape and human activity [1, 2]. Maintaining soil and ground at a required quality level allows for maintaining functions played by the lithosphere without changes. The quality of soil and land is assessed due to the presence of diff erent types of pollution (metals, inorganic contaminants, hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, pesticides etc.). On the other hand, the results of impacts exerted by contaminations depend on various factors, e.g. climate, physicochemical and biological properties of soil, the history of contamination, the way in which the area is used, accompanying contaminations, pathways through which contamination are transported, etc. In Poland soil and ground assessments and observation of changes in the contamination level are performed pursuant within the Polish environmental monitoring program [4]. The monitoring of arable grounds chemistry in Poland has been conducted since 1995 in 5-year cycles. In Poland arable soils are chemically analyzed at the Institute of Soil Science and

N2  - ABSTRACT Exposure to contaminants, generally called pollution, relates back to olden age when the environment was clean and free from chemicals. Knowledge of human exposure to environmental contaminants is an important component of environmental epidemiology, risk assessment, risk management, status and trends analysis. Exposure information provides a critical link between sources of contaminants, their presence in the environment and potential human health effects. Important exposure medias include outdoor air, indoor air, food, exterior and interior soil, household dust, drinking and cooking water. Exposure occurs via inhalation, ingestion and dermal contact. Indoor dust is becoming recognized as a reservoir for many toxic substances and a potentially significant source of human exposure. Pesticides found in indoor settled dust come from its use in the house, as well as from outdoor sources and as little or no training is provided for its use, unnecessary exposures often occur. Pesticides have also been examined in epidemiological studies as environmental risk factors for cancer. Assessing exposure to contamination with biological markers presents a unique advantage and represents a different perspective for evaluation of human exposure to contamination. Risk assessment may be used to identify and evaluate population and individuals at potentially greater risk so that appropriate mitigation actions can be implemented. A thorough evaluation of the various health and broader impacts of interventions to reduce pollution will help generate the evidence that is required for making sound policy recommendations. Thus globally, pollution prevention should be a key policy in National Environmental Protection activities of all the governments.  Key Words :  Hazards, Human Exposure, Exposure Media, Contaminants, Bio-markers, Risk Assessment

N2  - Pentachlorophenol is used as an industrial wood preservative for utility poles, crossarms, fence posts, and other purposes (79%);for NaPCP (12%); and miscellaneous, including mill uses, consumer wood preserving formulations and herbicide intermediate (9%) (CMR, 1980). As a wood preservative, pentachlorophenol acts as both a fungicide and insecticide (Freiter, 1978). The miscellaneous mill uses primarily involve the application of pentachlorophenol as a slime reducer in paper and pulp milling and may constitute ∼6% of the total annual consumption of pentachlorophenol (Crosby et al., 1981). Sodium pentachlorophenate (NaPCP) is also used as an antifungal and antibacterial agent (Freiter, 1978). Pentachlorophenol also is used as a general herbicide (Martin and Worthing, 1977). Photolysis and microbial degradation are the important chemical removal mechanisms for pentachlorophenol in water. In surface waters, pentachlorophenol photolyzes rapidly (ECETOC, 1984; Wong and Crosby. 1981; Zepp et al., 1984); however, the photolytic rate decreases as the depth in water increases (Pignatello et al., 1983). Pentachlorophenol is readily biodegradable in the presence of accli-mated microorganisms; however, biodegradation in natural waters requires the presence of microbes that can become acclimated. A natural river water that had been receiving domestic and industrial effluents significantly biodegraded pentachlorophenol after a 15-day lag period, while an unpolluted natural river water was unable to biodegrade the compound (Banerjee et al., 1984). Even though pentachlorophenol is in ionized form in natural waters, sorption to organic particulate matter and sediments can occur (Schellenberg et al., 1984), with desorption contributing as a continuing source of pollution in a contaminated environment (Pierce and Victor, 1978). Experimentally determined BCFs have shown that pentachlorophenol can significantly accumulate in aquatic organisms (Gluth et al., 1985; Butte et al., 1985; Statham et al., 1976; Veith et al., 1979a,b; Ernst and Weber, 1978), which is consistent with its widespread detection in fish and other organisms. Direct photolysis may be an important environmental sink for pen tachlorophenol present in the atmosphere. The detection of pen tachlorophenol in snow and rain water (Paasivirta et al., 1985; Bevenue et al., 1972) suggests that removal from air by dissolution is possible. Soil degradation studies indicate that pentachlorophenol is biodegrad able; microbial decomposition is an important and potentially domin ant removal mechanism in soil (Baker et al., 1980; Baker and Mayfield, 1980; Edgehill and Finn, 1983; Kirsch and Etzel, 1973; Ahlborg and Thunberg, 1980). The degree to which pentachlorophenol leaches in soil is dependent on the type of soil. In soils of neutral pH, leaching may be significant, but in acidic soils, adsorption to soil generally increases (Callahan et al. , 1979; Sanborn et al. , 1977). The ionized form of pentachlorophenol may be susceptible to adsorption in some soils (Schellenberg et al., 1984). In laboratory soils, pen tachlorophenol decomposes faster in soils of high organic content as compared with low organic content, and faster when moisture content is high and the temperature is conducive to microbial activity. Half- lives are usually ∼2-4 weeks (Crosby et al., 1981). Monitoring studies have confirmed the widespread occurrence of pentachlorophenol in surface waters, groundwater, drinking water and industrial effluents (see Table 2). The U.S. EPA's National Urban Runoff Program and National Organic Monitoring Survey reported frequent detections in storm water runoff and public water supplies (Cole et al., 1984; Mello, 1978). Primary sources by which pen tachlorophenol may be emitted to environmental waters may be through its use in wood preservation and the associated effluents and its pesticidal applications. Pentachlorophenol can be emitted to the atmosphere by evaporation from treated wood or water surfaces, by releases from cooling towers using pentachlorophenol biocides or by incineration of treated wood (Skow et al., 1980; Crosby et al., 1981). Pentachlorophenol has been detected in ambient atmospheres (Caut reels et al., 1977), in snow and rain water (Paasivirta et al,. 1985; Bevenue et al., 1972) and in emissions from hazardous waste incinera tion (Oberg et al., 1985). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Total Diet Study (conducted between 1964 and 1977) found pen tachlorophenol residues in 91/4428 ready-to-eat food composites (See Tables 4 and 5). The average American dietary intake of pen tachlorophenol during 1965-1969 was estimated to range from <0.001-0.006 mg/day (Duggan and Corneliussen, 1972). The most likely source of pentachlorophenol contamination in many food prod ucts may be the exposure of the food to pentachlorophenol-treated wood materials such as storage containers (Dougherty, 1978). Acute toxicity data indicated that salmonids are more sensitive to the toxic effects of pentachlorophenol than other fish species, with LC50 values of 34-128 μg/l for salmonids and 60-600 μg/l for other species. More recent data showed that carp larvae, bluegills, channel catfish and knifefish also had LC50 values < 100 μ gl (see Table 10). The most sensitive marine fishes were pinfish larvae, the goby, Gobius minutus, and eggs and larvae of the flounder, Pleuronectes platessa, all with LC50 values <100 μ g/l (Adema and Vink, 1981). The most sensitive freshwater invertebrate species were the chironomid, Chironomus gr. thummi (Slooff, 1983) and the snail, Lymnaea luteola (Gupta et al., 1984). The most sensitive marine invertebrates were the Eastern oyster (Borthwick and Schimmel, 1978), larvae of the crusta ceans, Crangon crangon and Palaemon elegans (VanDijk et al. , 1977), and the copepod, Pseudodiaptomus coronatus (Hauch et al., 1980), all with LC50 values <200 μg/l. In chronic toxicity tests, the lowest concentration reported to cause adverse effects was 1.8 μg/l (NaPCP), which inhibited growth of sockeye salmon (Webb and Brett, 1973). The marine species tested displayed similar thresholds for chronic toxicity. Both acute and chronic toxicity increased at lower pH, probably because a lower pH favors the un-ionized form of pentachlorophenol, which is taken up more readily and is therefore more toxic than ionized pentachlorophenol (Kobayashi and Kishino, 1980; Spehar et al., 1985). Data concerning the effects of pentachlorophenol on aquatic plants were highly variable. Therefore, it was difficult to draw conclusions from these data. Pentachlorophenol did not appear to bioaccumulate in aquatic or ganisms to very high concentrations. BCFs for pentachlorophenol were <1000 for most species tested. The highest BCF was 3830 for the polychaete, Lanice conchilega (Ernst, 1979). Some species appear to have an inducible pentachlorophenol-detoxification mechanism, as evidenced in several experiments in which pentachlorophenol tissue levels peaked in 4-8 days and declined thereafter despite continued exposure (Pruitt et al., 1977; Trujillo et al., 1982). A study by Niimi and Cho (1983) indicated that uptake of waterborne pentachlorophenol from gills was much greater than uptake from food, indicating that bioconcentration of pentachlorophenol through the food chain is unlikely. Biomonitoring data of Lake Ontario fishes showed that similar pentachlorophenol levels were found in predators andforage species. Studies with experimental ecosystems have indicated that ecological effects may occur at pentachlorophenol levels as low as those causing chronic toxicity in sensitive species in single-species tests. The lowest concentration that caused adverse effects in these studies was 15.8 μg/l, which caused a reduction in numbers of individuals and species in a marine benthic community (Tagatz et al., 1978). Pentachlorophenol is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of rats, mice, monkeys and humans (Braun et al. , 1977, 1978; Ahlborg et al., 1974; Braun and Sauerhoff, 1976). Peak plasma concentrations are reached within 12-24 hours after oral administration to monkeys (Braun and Sauerhoff, 1976), but 4-6 hours after oral administration to rats (Braun et al., 1977). After oral administration, the highest concentration of radioactivity was found in the liver and gastrointesti nal tract of monkeys (Braun et al., 1977). In rats and mice, tet rachlorohydroquinone was identified in the urine (Jakobson and Yllner, 1971; Braun et al., 1977; Ahlborg et al., 1974) as well as unmetabolized pentachlorophenol and glucuronide-conjugated pen tachlorophenol. Although Ahlborg et al. (1974) reported that oxidative dechlorination of pentachlorophenol occurs in humans, as evidenced by the presence of tetrachlorohydroquinone in the urine of workers occupationally exposed (probably by inhalation), analysis of human urine after ingestion of pentachlorophenol revealed the presence of conjugated pentachlorophenol and unmetabolized pentachlorophenol (Braun et al., 1978). The primary route of excretion after oral administrtation of all species studied is in the urine (Braun et al. , 1977, 1978; Ahlborg et al., 1974; Larsen et al., 1972; Braun and Sauerhoff, 1976). Although urinary excretion followed second-order kinetics in rats (Larsen et al., 1972; Braun et al., 1977) except in females receiving a single high dose (100 mg/kg) of pentachlorophenol, urinary excretion of pentachlorophenol in humans and monkeys followed first-order kinetics (Braun and Sauerhoff, 1976; Braun et al., 1978). Enterohepatic circulation played an importation role in the pharmacokinetics of pen tachlorophenol. The half-life of pentachlorophenol in the plasma is longer in female rats and monkeys than it is in male rats and monkeys (Braun et al. , 1978; Braun and Sauerhoff, 1976). Because many preparations of pentachlorophenol are contaminated with small but measurable amounts of highly toxic substances, such as dibenzodioxins, special

N2  - A study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of Deltamethrin (0.4% impregnated targets and 1% pour-on formulation) in controlling tsetse and trypanosomosis was carried out in two selected 10 km × 10 km Universal Transverse Mercator Grids of the Southern Tsetse Eradication Project (STEP) area in the southern rift valley of Ethiopia. The Grids selected were H3 (site I) and G5 (site II) in two districts of the Wolaita Zone. The trial was underway from September 2003 to April 2004. The strategy followed to accomplish the trial was a pre-intervention phase (entomology and parasitology) and an intervention phase with insecticide (Deltamethrin 0.4%)-impregnated odour-baited targets in site I and Deltamethrin 1% 'pour-on' application to cattle in site II. The intervention phase was monitored on a monthly basis. Following the deployment of 460 targets at a density of 4 targets per km2 in trial site I, the relative abundance of tsetse fly (Glossina pallidipes) declined from a pre-intervention mean catch of 1.35 flies per trap per day to 0.05 flies per trap per day at final monitoring. These resulted in an 88.9% overall reduction. Similarly, an 83.25% reduction was recorded in the incidence of trypanosomosis in sentinel cattle as it dropped from 10.75% (first monitoring) to 1.8% (last monitoring). The corresponding measures of packed cell volume (PCV) have shown a significant improvement from a mean of 21.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 20.7-22.9) at first monitoring to 25.5% (95% CI: 24.3-26.7) of last monitoring (P < 0.01). In site II, the trial was started by spraying Deltamethrin 1% pour-on to 409 cattle at a rate of 1 ml/10 kg body weight. Pour-on treatment was repeated every month throughout the trial period. A sharp drop in the relative abundance of tsetse fly was revealed soon after. The catch was nil at fourth monitoring as it declined from 0.91 flies per trap per day of pre-intervention (P < 0.01). A 94.9% overall reduction was achieved. The incidence of trypanosomosis in sentinel cattle also declined from 10% (first monitoring) to 0.95% (last monitoring) with about 90.5% decline. An improvement in the overall mean PCV was seen as it rose from a mean of 24.1% (95% CI: 22.9-25.3) at first monitoring to 27.2% (95% CI: 26.2-28.1) at last monitoring which revealed a significant increase (P < 0.01) until the third monitoring and maintained a stable state thereafter. This work finally disclosed that a relatively better efficacy was attained by using Deltamethrin pour-on formulation than targets in controlling tsetse and trypanosomiosis. However, this difference did not prove an apparent significance (P > 0.05). So it is recommended to continue the current tsetse suppression by using the integrated approach of both techniques under consideration. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Biological methods such as mycorrhiza biotechnology used for raising and sustaining soil fertility in agricultural ecosystems close to freshwater biomes are gaining attention. However, ubiquitous ecological conditions may subject mycorrhizal management to choices that depend on inoculum sources (autochthonous or cultured). Effects of AMF on growth of M. stenopetala and M. oleifera were evaluated using three native soil types, representative of Lake Victoria basin and a standard substrate. Autochthonous AMF was harnessed from the native soils while allochthonous AMF cocktail was acquired from culture banks of Glomus hoi, G. mosseae and G. intraradices, using Plantago major as plant indicator and trap-culture. The soils were blocked according to tillage intensities. P. major supplied Moringa with AMF inoculum. To facilitate mycorrhization, nitrogen fixing bacteria (NFB) in chickpea rhizobia inoculum was integrated. The hyphopodium assays revealed > 90% arbuscle occupancy in root cortex of plants established in paddy LT soils. AMF inoculation improved growth and biomass of both Moringa species. Autochthonous AMF inoculum had relatively higher biomass turnover compared to cultured AMF. The presence of dark septate endophytes (DSE) in plant biodiversity gave a new insight into target plant performance at plant competition for nutrients. Results reveal that inoculum AMF and NFB are potential candidates in optimizing plant production technology applicable in eco-sensitive-oriented low in-put agriculture. West African Journal of Applied Ecology, vol. 21 (1), 2013 48 are coated with glomalin, bound together by hydrophobic interactions (Nichols, 2003) Knopf et al.: Improving Moringa growth by using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 53 forstering stable soil macro-/microaggregates > 0. 25 mm (Tisdale & Oades, 1975; Tisdall & Nelson, 1979). Research trends in the Glomeraceae taxa categories representing natural classification based on molecular phylogenetic analyses at present are recognized as Glomus macrocarpum and Claroidoglomeraceae of Glomeraceae family (Schüßler & Walker, 2010). Allochthonous mycorrhiza are commonly cultured off-site while autochthonous cultures are communities in rhizospheric soils that can be harnessed to develop inoculum banks for possible application within the same environment. Limited availability of propagules could invite allochthonous mycorrhizal cultures in biological soil fertility improvement domains. Autochthonous preferences in inoculation strategy guarantees successful mycorrhizal re-establishment in degraded soil and are physiologically and genetically adapted to environment (Caravaca et al., 2003). Effectiveness of either autochthony or allochthony of fungal strains could be much dependent on species, edaphic factors, etc. Marulanda et al. (2007) documented that autochthonous AMF strains formed highest intraradical arbuscular development and produced higher lavender root biomass with efficient N and K absorption than with the inoculation of similar allochthonous strains under drought conditions. Requena et al. (2001) confirmed that dual inoculation with autochthonous AMF and rhizobial NFB not only enhanced the establishment of key plant species, but increased soil fertility, quality, soil N content, organic matter, hydrostable soil aggregates and enhanced N transfer from N-fixing to non-fixing species associated within the natural succession. Schreiner (2007) observed that plant growth was not affected by either native or non-native G. mosseae isolates in one case, although in another setup non-native isolates were registered to be more effective in promoting growth and nutrient uptake compared to native ones. Nevertheless, long term ecological implications of cultured specimens are unspecified. Situations such as water stress, invasive species or ruderal weeds may alter benign association in mycorrhization with gross impacts. Conditions fluctuate enough that any given association moves back and forth along mutualism-parasitism continuum (Bellgard & Steven, 2011), interfering with organism fitness, resiliency and functions. Like introduced species that often become invasive, exotic propagules may require caution before general application. Currently dark septate fungal endophytes (DSE) are gaining attention in mutualistic symbiosis, parasitism or even antagonistic impacts in the mycorrhizosphere, identified frequently in grasses and forbs (Jumpponen & Trappe, 1998), as well as tall grass prairie in complex nutritional acquisition (Mandyam et al., 2010). Jaison et al. (2012) recently reported that 33% of fruit crops in their study that was associated with DSE fungi, similarly, contained AMF, requiring further investigations based on endophytic roles in mycorrhization. Developments in AMF biotechonlogy also consider rhizobialmycorrhizal-legume symbiosis where P is bioavailed by legume rhizobia establishment and N2 fixation (Barea et al. 2005) facilitating AMF formation. Studies have confirmed that mycorrhiza is mutualistically associated with N-fixing prokaryotes, encouraging dual Knopf et al.: Improving Moringa growth by using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 49 inoculum in effective mycorrhizal management. Being native to Lake Victoria ecology, Moringa, in beneficial symbiosis with AMF is practicable Knopf et al.: Improving Moringa growth by using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 53 Knopf et al.: Improving Moringa growth by using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 49 when applied in Agroforestry, Moringa (class Moringacea; genera Rosidae) is a monotypic drought tolerant tropical species, falling under “underutilized” plants of the tropics (Price, 2000) that adjust to almost all soil types within altitudes from 600 m to1200 m within 25-40 °C temperature ranges but can survive at 2000 m above sea level and outlive light frosts (Reyes, 2006). M. stenopetala is endemic to Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia, while M. oleifera is indigenous to the sub-Himalayan tracts of north-west India, Asia (Makkar et al., 2001). The multiple uses of Moringa range from ecosystem services, human/animal/poultry food or multivitamins, soil/ water bioremediation/phytoremediation activities, medicinal usage, fertilizer, fungicide/pesticide and other diverse industrial usages such as oil production. The basis of this study was to improve tropical Moringa plant performance using eco-sensitive methods of enhancing soil fertility relevant to Lake Victoria basin. Materials and methods Soil sampling, treatment and storage Native soil sample selection (Table 1) was based on altitude range of 800-1800 m above sea level, representative of Lake Victoria basin, Kenya. The soils were categorized according to tillage frequency, high tillage (HT), medium tillage (MT), low tillage (LT) and standard substrate (ST) as effective soil control. The paddy LT frequency types were cored from a rice growing district at 00° 42' 00'’ N and 37° 22' 00'’ E, and an altitude of about 1300 m above sea level. The land tillage is up to 10-16 cm deep. Clay MT Alfisol came from sugarcane growing area 00° 05' 04.77'’ S and 35° 07' 57.51'’ E location, an important water catchment area for Lake Victoria. Tillage systems range from heavy machinery tillage, mould ploughs down to small tills privately applied by farmers. The well-drained acidicred oxisol came from the humid highlands with high rainfall situated at approximately 1800 m above sea-level. The fields are frequently tilled using multiple techniques. The arable lands are mostly used for annual crops but accommodate perennial cropping like tea bushes. The soils were air-dried in the shade for 2 weeks, pulverised and passed through 2-mm size sieve to remove organic matter, stored in a laboratory at room temperature, analysed using VDLUFA MB I, D2.1 (Fingerprobe) A 5.1.1 (pH-Wert) and A 6.2.1.1 CAL-Methods, version 2002 in soil analyses methods in an earlier study based in the research centre Helmholtzzentrum, München.

N2  - Cadmium and lead are known to be toxic for living organism even if it is present in low levels. This study deals with the use of the reactive poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers for the removal of cadmium and lead from aqueous solutions. In this study, PET was grafted with 2-hydroxy propyl methacrylate (2-HPMA) as a monomer in the presence of benzoyl peroxide (Bz2O2) as an initiator. Reactive fibers were used as a new adsorbent for the removal of cadmium and lead ions from aqueous solutions. The effects of HNO3 and NaOH on filter adsorption properties were studied. The results were shown that the used reactive fiber was resistance under basic and acidic conditions and ion adsorption was no significant change. Removal of adsorbed cadmium and lead from filter were examined by Ca(NO3)2, HNO3 and NaOH. More than 93 percent of the adsorbed ions by the filter were removed by HNO3. While Ca(NO3)2 was able to desorbed 40 percent of adsorbed ions. Keyword: CD, Pd, PET Received 22/12/2014 Accepted 02/04/2014 ©2014 AELS, INDIA INTRUDUCTION On environmental topics; metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, nickel and chromium are heavy metals and their effects and compounds are damaging to human health and the environment. These toxins are available in the air, water, building materials, kitchen appliances and even clothing [1, 2]. Cadmium increases naturally in the environment t h r o u g h gradual processes such as rock abrasion and soil erosion as well as from singular events such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires. It is also a d d ed to the environment by human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels, the application of phosphate fertilizers, electroplating, metal production, and the manufacture of batteries, screens, and pigment [3,4]. Cadmium is, therefore, could naturally be present everywhere in soil, water, air, and foods. Greenockite, cadmium sulfide (77.6% Cd), is the most important cadmium mineral. Other minerals are cadmium carbonate (61.5% Cd), otavite, and pure cadmium oxide (87.5% Cd). Greenockite (CdS) is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS) [4]. Cadmium has been classified as a human carcinogen and teratogen impacting the lungs, liver, kidneys, and reproductive organs [1, 5]. A wellknown, major case of cadmium poisoning resulted in ‘Itai-Itai’ disease caused by cadmium contamination of the Jintsu River in Japan. The World Health Organization (WHO) has determi ned 0.003 mg L −1 to be the maximum acceptable concentration of Cd2+ in drinking water [6]. Lead is a heavy metal that is also present with other metals, and in agriculture has found many applications (used in pesticides). The source of Lead is mainly from the fuel of gasoline-powered vehicles. In addition, the lead content of chemical fertilizers and white iron pipe corrosion in water pipes, or the dissolution of glazed earthenware can enter in the food chain of animal and human. Transfer of lead in soil and plant tissues is very low. The Limit intake of lead in human solid food is about 600 micrograms per day [7-10].World Health Organization has been suggested the o.3 mg / kg as the limit of lead [WHO].[6] B eca u s e o f the low limit of cadmium and lead pollution acceptable in drinking water, there

N2  - For agricultural production is used almost 40% of the global land from where it dominates conventional agriculture which uses large amounts of inputs in the form of fertilizers and pesticides leading to the contamination of soil, water resources, air pollution and land erosion, affects biodiversity and extinction of many plants and animals. On the other hand, the world's population is constantly growing and currently numbers more than 8 billion people and it is estimated that food production will have to double by 2050. In order to meet the future needs of the population for food raw materials, food production must significantly increase, and at the same time, the impact of agriculture on the environment and natural resources must be drastically reduced. Sustainable agriculture is emerging as one of the solutions. This way of agricultural practice refers to the management and preservation of natural resources through organizational and technological changes in modern agricultural production in order to satisfy human needs and preserve the environment. One of the most important natural resources on which the entire agricultural production relies is land. In intensively cultivated lands, there is a noticeable trend of intense degradation, which represents a major problem facing humanity. The paper reviews the decrease in soil fertility based on the samples collected during the five-year monitoring, as well as a proposal for measures to increase fertility and future preservation of this environmental resource.

N2  - 29 Toxic elements e.g. arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), 30 and zinc (Zn) are the chief environmental pollutants which can cause deleterious health effects in 31 humans. Inhalation and consumption of metal-contaminated food are the major pathways of metal 32 entrance into human body. Cultivation of crop plants in the metal-contaminated soils induces the 33 bioaccumulation of toxic elements in the food chain. Among different food items, vegetables have 34 major contribution in the daily diet, and the heavy metal contamination of vegetables poses a threat 35 to human health with the prevalence of skin and gastrointerestinal cancer. 36 The uptake and bioaccumulation of toxic elements in vegetables are influenced by a number 37 of factors such as atmospheric deposition, metal concentrations in soil, soil characteristics, and 38 duration of cultivation. Cultivation areas near highways are exposed to atmospheric pollution in the 39 form of metal containing aerosols which can be deposited on leaves of vegetables and then 40 absorbed. The magnitude of heavy metal deposition on vegetable surfaces varied with morpho41 physiological nature of the vegetables. Post-harvest activities, such as transportation, marketing, 42 cooking, etc., may also influence the deposition of toxic elements in vegetables. Incorporation of 43 toxic elements during transportation and marketing of vegetable can be occurred due to the use of 44 contaminated water. Higher heavy metal content in vegetables from urban area then those from 45 rural areas may be due to the contribution of urban activities which elevates heavy metal loads in 46 atmospheric deposition and consequently in the edible part of the vegetables. Cooking has definite 47 influence to the content of toxic elements in cooked items if the heavy metal concentrations in the 48 cooking water are high. 49 Vegetable consumption varies with age group, food habit, as well as vegetable availability. 50 For example the mean daily vegetable consumption among the European people is 153 g (ranged 51 between 109-241 g) while it is around 250g among the South Asian people. Vegetables occupy a 52 substantial proportion of the daily diet for the South-East Asian people, especially the Japanese, 53 Korean and Chinese people. Thus, whatever the metal contents in vegetables are, their intake in 54 human is, off course, dependent on the total vegetable consumption. In this review, the contribution 55 of vegetables in dietary intake of toxic elements has been discussed from a common platform. 56 57 INTRODUCTION: 58 Metals comprise about 75% of the known elements and have been used from the beginning 59 of ancient human civilization. Since the beginning of the Industrial Age, metals have been emitted 60 to and deposited in the environment [1]. In some cases, metals have accumulated in terrestrial and 61 aquatic environments in high concentrations and cause harm to animals and humans via ingestion 62 of soil and/or dust, food, and water; inhalation of polluted air; and absorption via the skin from 63 polluted soils, water and air [2]. Increasing use of metals with the boom of population and economy, 64 especially in the developing countries, could contaminate the soil and water causing the 65 deterioration of environmental quality and posing threat to human health. [1]. 66 Metals can be classified in to light, heavy, semimetal (i.e. metalloids), toxic, and trace, 67 depending on several physico-chemical characteristics [3]. Certain metals and metalloids, 68 commonly known as micronutrients, are essential for plant growth and animal health. 69 Micronutrients include B, Cu, Fe, Zn, Mn, Mo. In addition, As, Co, Cr, Ni, Se, Sn, and V are 70 especially essential in animal nutrition. Micronutrients are also known as “trace elements” since 71 they are needed in only small quantities. In excess, trace elements can be toxic to living beings 72 though their deficiency is also a problem to the normal growth of plant, microbes, and animals [1]. 73 Important trace elements in the environment are As, Ag, B, Ba, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Mo, 74 Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn. However, the trace elements are also essential for organisms at low 75 concentrations in most of the cases [4]. 76 The trace elements can be derived from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Natural 77 (geogenic) sources includes parent rocks and metallic minerals, and the anthropogenic sources 78 include agriculture (fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and animal manures), mining, smelting, and 79 sewage sludge and scrap disposal [4]. Anthropogenic deposition is a major mechanism for heavy 80 metal input in the environment. Soil is the major recipient of trace elements in terrestrial 81 environment, while sediments are the major sink in aquatic environment. Leaching of heavy metals 82 or transport via mobile colloids can contaminate groundwater. On the other hand, runoff and 83 drainage of the heavy metals via sediments can contaminate freshwater environment [2, 4]. 84 Bioaccumulation of toxic elements in the food chain can be especially dangerous to human 85 health. The toxic metals can enter into the human body by either inhalation or by ingestion; and 86 ingestion is the main route of exposure to these elements [5]. For most of the people the main route 87 of exposure to trace elements is diet except occupational exposures at related industries [6]. The 88 exposure of heavy metal through the food chain has been reported in many countries, particularly in 89 developing countries, and received huge attention from the governmental and non-governmental 90 agencies [7-10]. The concern by environmentalists of the accumulation of toxic metals in the food 91 chain, and the harmful effects on the environment by those metals has escalated in recent years. 92 Once these metals enter into the biological systems they disturb the normal biochemical processes, 93 and in some cases it can be fatal [11]. Regulations have been set up for the industries and other 94 structures that discharging pollutants into the environment in many countries to control the 95 emission of trace elements and their subsequent health effects. 96 Vegetables constitute essential components of the diet, by contributing proteins, vitamins, 97 iron, calcium, and other nutrients. A constant supply of essential bioavailable trace elements is 98 necessary and highly recommended for daily life [12]. Vegetables also act as buffering agents for 99 acid substances obtained during the digestion process and contain both essential and toxic elements 100 over a wide range of concentrations [13]. Vegetable is one of the major diets for the populations of 101 many countries. A Bangladeshi individual, regardless of gender, consumes an average of 130 g 102 vegetables per day (leafy and non-leafy) and in the total diet, the proportion varied from 12 21% 103 [14, 15]. However, the recommended requirement of vegetables in daily diets is 200 g person day 104 1 [16]. The Japanese diet is substantially high in vegetables, fish and soy products, and low in 105 saturated fats and sugar [17]. A large proportion of the adult United States population eats no 106 vegetables (0.17) or fruit (0.41) on any given day [18]. Based on a comprehensive literature review, 107 the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) concluded that diet influences the risk of several major 108 chronic diseases and recommended eating five or more daily servings of a combination of 109 vegetables and fruit, especially green and yellow vegetables and citrus fruit [19]. The US 110 Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) 111 recommend as part of their food guidance system that the daily diet include two to three servings of 112 fruit and three to five servings of vegetables [20, 21]. But about 45 percent of the population had no 113 servings of fruit or juice and 22 percent had no servings of a vegetable on the recall day. Only 27 114 percent consumed the three or more servings of vegetables and 29 percent had the two or more 115 servings of fruit recommended by the US Departments of Agriculture and of Health and Human 116 Services; 9 percent had both [22]. The people of Mediterranean countries consume about 248 g 117 (113-456 g) of vegetables a day [23]. On the other hand, vegetable is neglected in the daily diet of 118 Arabian countries. 119 Recently, vegetable becomes popular in daily diet of health conscious people because of its 120 antioxidant properties. A wide number of vegetables are consumed by the population of different 121 countries worldwide. Heavy metal uptake in vegetables and other food crops due to soil, water, and 122 atmospheric contamination is a great threat to the food quality and food safety [5]. The uptake and 123 bioaccumulation of trace elements in vegetables are influenced by a number of factors such as 124 climate, atmospheric depositions, the concentrations of trace elements in the soils, the nature of 125 soils on which the vegetables are grown, and the exposure time [24, 25]. Trace elements from air 126 may also be deposited on vegetables during post-harvest activities such as transportation, 127 marketing, etc. [6]. Vegetables accumulate trace elements from contaminated soils and store them 128 in their edible and inedible parts with various concentrations, as well as from deposits on parts of 129 vegetables exposed to the air from polluted environment [26]. 130 Dietary intake of trace elements from vegetables is an important concern because of their 131 potential health risks, and detrimental effects on the environment. It has been reported that nearly 132 half of the mean ingestion of lead, cadmium, and mercury through food is of plant origin (fruits, 133 vegetables, and cereals) [5]. Previously, a large scale study on trace elements in vegetables and 134 fruits from the Valparaiso region of Chile has been conducted by Pinochet et al. [27

N2  - Pesticide pollution is a serious concern of our life and also for our ecosystem. Because of exponential growth in population and rapid industrialization the contamination of our food, air, water and soil due to extensive use of pesticides and other toxic compounds has become a threat to the continued survival of all living beings. The quality of ground and surface water badly affected by the agricultural run offs as they contain synthetic pesticides and fertilizer residues. When pesticides and chemicals contaminate water that becomes harmful to living beings when it consume or come in contact with fishes and other animals then it increase the incidences of mass mortality and also badly affects the fish survival, physiology, growth, reproduction and overall behaviour. The use of organophosphorus pesticides in agricultural industry cause the environmental issues and the argent demand for different another methods of pest control for minimise such damage, in that spot comprehensive review on pest control with the use of biopesticides. Normally neem oil a biopesticide is considered of low toxicity towards non-target aquatic life comparative to organohosphorus pesticides. Therefore, the use of neem oil in fish farming and agricultural lands should be promoted to its productivity in enhancing immunity against retardation of the development of specific virulent. This article provides the major assessment to know the benefits of bio-pesticide comparative to organophosphorous pesticide nuvan.

N2  - Chemical contaminants may occur in our food from various sources. Contaminants can be present in foods mainly as a result of the use of agrochemicals, such as residues of pesticides and veterinary drugs, contamination from environmental sources (water, air or soil pollution), cross-contamination or formation during food processing, migration from food packaging materials, presence or contamination by natural toxins or use of unapproved food additives and adulterants. They typically pose a health concern, resulting in strict regulations of their levels by national governments and internationally. Therefore, analysis of relevant chemical contaminants is an essential part of food safety testing programs to ensure consumer safety and compliance with regulatory limits. Modern analytical techniques can determine known chemical contaminants in complex food matrices at very low concentration levels. Moreover, they can also help discover and identify new or unexpected chemical contaminants.

N2  - Cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) is a popular leafy vegetable in  Ethiopia. However, the production and productivity of the crop are often constrained by several factors, such as deprived soil fertility and poor agronomic practices. Thus, a study was conducted in two locations in the East Gojjam zone of northwestern Ethiopia during the 2021/2022 cropping season to evaluate the effect of bud numbers and farmyard manure fertilizer rates on the growth and yield components of cabbage. Three numbers of cabbage buds (1, 2, and 3) and four levels of farmyard manure (0, 2.5, 5, and 7.5 tons/ha) were laid out in a 3 × 4 factorial arrangement in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Data on yield and quality were recorded and subjected to analysis of variance. The results revealed that growth, yield, and quality components were significantly influenced by the interaction effects of bud number and farmyard manure fertilizer rate. In both locations, the highest marketable (41.8 tons/ha) and total (43.1 tons/ha) yields were attained from the combined effects of 2 buds of cabbage and 5 tons of farmyard manure. The highest medium-sized heads (31.8 tons/ha) of cabbage were also recorded from the combination of 2 buds with 5 tons of farmyard manure. Moreover, the combined effects of 2 buds and 5 tons of farmyard manure showed the highest net benefit (5,679.03 US dollars) over the other treatments at the two locations. Hence, based on the results of the study, the combination of 2 buds and 5 tons of farmyard manure fertilizer can be suggested for the economical production of cabbage in northwestern Ethiopia and similar environments.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic malaria parasitemia patients constitute an effective  transmission pool for malaria infection in the community. However, less attention has been given to malaria control and elimination strategies. Therefore, to achieve a malaria elimination strategy, investigating the magnitude of asymptomatic malaria in different settings in Ethiopia is crucial. However, there is not enough information on the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infection and associated risk factors in the Bench Sheko Zone, southwest Ethiopia. This study, therefore, aimed to provide information and help achieve sustainable malaria elimination. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to April 2019 in Mizan-Aman town, southwest Ethiopia. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic information. Plasmodium species were screened using microscopy and rapid diagnostic test (RDT). HemoCue was used to measure haemoglobin levels. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0 was used for descriptive and logistic regression statistics to risk factors. A P-value of 0.05 was used as a cutoff-value for significance. RESULTS: A total of 353 malaria-like symptom free participants were enrolled in this study. 17 seventeen (4.8%, 95% Confidence interval = 2.57, 7.03) asymptomatic malaria cases were revealed; among these, 12 (70.58%) (95% CI = 65.75, 75.25) were due to Plasmodium vivax and 5 (29.41%) (95% CI = 24.74, 34.25) were due to Plasmodium falciparum. Asymptomatic malaria was significantly associated with the presence of mosquito breeding sites [Adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 6.06 (1.76-20.82)], insecticide-treated nets (ITN) use [AOR = 3.51 (0.97-12.68)], and indoor residual spraying (IRS) [AOR = 3.95 (1.26-12.37)]. Mild anaemia was found in 20% (3/15) of the asymptomatic malaria patients. Additionally, there was a significant association between malaria and anaemia [OR = 5.786 (1.46-22.85)] in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The population of the current study area will be at risk because asymptomatic malaria is present. Low coverage of the IRS, ITN, and proximity of stagnant water in residences had an impact on asymptomatic malaria. Further studies are needed on the burden of asymptomatic malaria via molecular methods, and the Bench Sheko regional health office is better able to scale-up malaria prevention and control tools.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria prevention has  traditionally been implemented in Ethiopia by the district health office with technical and operational inputs from regional, zonal, and central health offices. The United States President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia tested the effectiveness and efficiency of integrating IRS into the government-funded community-based rural health services program. METHODS: Between 2012 and 2014, PMI conducted a mixed-methods study in 11 districts of Oromia region to compare district-based IRS (DB IRS) and community-based IRS (CB IRS) models. In the DB IRS model, each district included 2 centrally located operational sites where spray teams camped during the IRS campaign and from which they traveled to the villages to conduct spraying. In the CB IRS model, spray team members were hired from the communities in which they operated, thus eliminating the need for transport and camping facilities. The study team evaluated spray coverage, the quality of spraying, compliance with environmental and safety standards, and cost and performance efficiency. RESULTS: The average number of eligible structures found and sprayed in the CB IRS districts increased by 19.6% and 20.3%, respectively, between 2012 (before CB IRS) and 2013 (during CB IRS). Between 2013 and 2014, the numbers increased by about 14%. In contrast, in the DB IRS districts the number of eligible structures found increased by only 8.1% between 2012 and 2013 and by 0.4% between 2013 and 2014. The quality of CB IRS operations was good and comparable to that in the DB IRS model, according to wall bioassay tests. Some compliance issues in the first year of CB IRS implementation were corrected in the second year, bringing compliance up to the level of the DB IRS model. The CB IRS model had, on average, higher amortized costs per district than the DB IRS model but lower unit costs per structure sprayed and per person protected because the community-based model found and sprayed more structures. CONCLUSION: Established community-based service delivery systems can be adapted to include a seasonal IRS campaign alongside the community-based health workers' routine activities to improve performance efficiency. Further modifications of the community-based IRS model may reduce the total cost of the intervention and increase its financial sustainability.

N2  - Material Flow Analysis is a method that can be used to assess sanitation systems  with regard to their environmental impacts. Modelling water and nutrients flows of the urban water, wastewater and waste system can highlight risks for environmental pollution and can help evaluating the potential for linking sanitation with resource recovery and agricultural production. This study presents the results of an analysis of nitrogen and phosphorus flows of Arba Minch town in South Ethiopia. The current situation is modelled and possible scenarios for upgrading the town's sanitation system are assessed. Two different scenarios for nutrient recovery are analysed. Scenario one includes co-composting municipal organic waste with faecal sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks as well as the use of compost in agriculture. The second scenario based on urine-diversion toilets includes application of urine as fertiliser and composting of faecal matter. In order to allow for variations in the rate of adoption, the model can simulate varying degrees of technology implementation. Thus, the impact of a step-wise or successive approach can be illustrated. The results show that significant amounts of plant nutrients can be provided by both options, co-composting and urine diversion.

N2  - Selenium (Se) deficiency among populations in Ethiopia is consistent with low  concentrations of Se in soil and crops that could be addressed partly by Se-enriched fertilisers. This study examines the disease burden of Se deficiency in Ethiopia and evaluates the cost-effectiveness of Se agronomic biofortification. A disability-adjusted life years (DALY) framework was used, considering goiter, anaemia, and cognitive dysfunction among children and women. The potential efficiency of Se agronomic biofortification was calculated from baseline crop composition and response to Se fertilisers based on an application of 10 g/ha Se fertiliser under optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. The calculated cost per DALY was compared against gross domestic product (GDP; below 1-3 times national GDP) to consider as a cost-effective intervention. The existing national food basket supplies a total of 28·2 µg of Se for adults and 11·3 µg of Se for children, where the risk of inadequate dietary Se reaches 99·1 %-100 %. Cereals account for 61 % of the dietary Se supply. Human Se deficiency contributes to 0·164 million DALYs among children and women. Hence, 52 %, 43 %, and 5 % of the DALYs lost are attributed to anaemia, goiter, and cognitive dysfunction, respectively. Application of Se fertilisers to soils could avert an estimated 21·2-67·1 %, 26·6-67·5 % and 19·9-66·1 % of DALY via maize, teff and wheat at a cost of US$129·6-226·0, US$149·6-209·1 and US$99·3-181·6, respectively. Soil Se fertilisation of cereals could therefore be a cost-effective strategy to help alleviate Se deficiency in Ethiopia, with precedents in Finland.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Intestinal schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma mansoni is a wide  spread disease in most parts of Ethiopian highlands. Snail control is one major strategy in schistosomiasis control. The use of molluscicidal plant products is becoming interesting due to their environmental friendliness, accessibility and easy application. This research is aimed to evaluate the molluscicidal effect of Achyranthes aspera on Biomphalaria pfeifferi and Lymnaea natalensis snails, which are of great medical and veterinary importance in Ethiopia. METHODS: Adult B. pfeifferi snails were exposed to the various concentrations of A. aspera aqueous leaf extract for 24, 48 and 72 h. Similarly, adult L. natalensis snails were exposed to the extract for 24 h. Mortality data were analyzed using probit regression model. Phytochemical content of the plant was analyzed using standard screening methods. RESULTS: The plant's molluscicidal effect on the two snail species was demonstrated. The 24 h LC(50) and LC(90) values against L. natalensis were 69.5 and 93.9 ppm respectively. In the 24, 48 and 72 h exposure of B. pfeifferi, the LC(50) values were 72.4, 69.9, 64.7 ppm and the LC(90) were 96.5, 93.8, 92.8 ppm, respectively. The phytochemical screening tests indicated presence of saponins. CONCLUSION: From the findings of this study, A. aspera has a molluscicidal potential. The result provides a useful foundation for further in-depth studies to ensure its wider applicability in different water bodies and evaluate its toxic effects on non-target species.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pesticide exposure is a major public health issue among farmers  affecting make it their health, economic stability, and agricultural productivity. This study aimed to investigate the magnitude and determinants of farmers' knowledge of health risks, safety practices, and acute pesticide poisoning in the South Wollo Zone, Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the South Wollo Zone's irrigation areas from July to August 2022. Using a multistage sampling technique, five out of ten irrigation districts were randomly selected, and three kebeles (the smallest administrative unit) from each district (15 total) were chosen based on intensive irrigation activities. A proportional sample size was allocated across the selected kebeles according to the number of farmers. Trained data collectors conducted face-to-face interviews using a pretested structured questionnaire. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals at a p-value of 0.05 identified statistically significant factors. RESULT: The study found that 55.2% of farmers had below mean knowledge of health risks, 63.7% practiced below mean safety practices, and 47.9% experienced acute pesticide poisoning. Significant factors for below mean knowledge included no formal education (AOR = 2.32; 95% CI: 1.27-4.23) and lack of pesticide training (AOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.33-3.21). Below mean safety practices were associated with age > 47 years (AOR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.06-4.04), below mean retailer actions (AOR = 1.97; 95% CI: 1.34-2.89), and below mean attitude (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.23-2.62). Acute pesticide poisoning was significantly associated with over 10 years of exposure (AOR = 4.34; 95% CI: 2.55-7.39), below mean knowledge (AOR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.23-2.62), lack of training (AOR = 3.73; 95% CI: 2.33-5.98), and below mean safety practices (AOR = 4.40; 95% CI: 2.86-6.78). CONCLUSION: Farmers' knowledge of health risks and safety practices was not satisfactory. Low educational status, lack of training, and minimal government involvement were associated with below mean knowledge. Below mean knowledge and below mean safety practices, low education, lack of training, and minimal government involvement were associated with acute pesticide poisoning. Young farmers, limited retailer involvement, and below mean attitudes contribute to unsafe practices.

N2  - The use of agricultural waste for soil amendment is limited in developing  countries. Competition between fuel and feed is the major cause for the insufficient application of agricultural waste on cropland. The aims of this study were therefore (i) to investigate variation in agricultural waste allocation between groups of farmers with different livelihood strategies and link this allocation with the nutrient balances of their production systems, (ii) to identify farm characteristics that influence utilisation of agricultural waste for soil amendment, and (iii) to assess demand for urban waste compost. A total of 220 farmers were selected randomly and interviewed using standardised semi-structured questionnaires. Four groups of farmers, namely (i) field crop farmers, (ii) vegetable producers, (iii) ornamental-plant growers, and (iv) farmers practising mixed farming, were identified using categorical principal component and two-step cluster analyses. Field crop farmers produced the largest quantity of agricultural waste, but they allocated 80% of manure to fuel and 85% of crop residues to feed. Only <10% of manure and crop residues were applied on soils. Farmers also sold manure and crop residues, and this generated 5-10% of their annual income. Vegetable and ornamental-plant growers allocated over 40% of manure and crop residues to soil amendment. Hence, nutrient balances were less negative in vegetable production systems. Education, farm size, land tenure and access to extension services were the variables that impeded allocation of agricultural waste to soil amendment. Replacement of fuel and feed through sustainable means is a viable option for soil fertility management. Urban waste compost should also be used as alternative option for soil amendment. Our results showed variation in compost demand between farmers. Education, landownership, experience with compost and access to extension services explained variation in compost demand. We also demonstrated that labour availability should be used to estimate compost demand beside cash.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world. However, as daily consumables, coffee beans may contain pesticide residues that are capable of causing adverse health effects. Thus, we investigated residue dynamics in coffee beans using supervised field trials under Good Agricultural Practice conditions and determined the effects of household coffee processing on the coffee-bean pesticide residues dinotefuran and its metabolites 1-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl) urea (UF) and 1-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl) guanidine (DN). RESULTS: The recovery rate of dinotefuran and its metabolites UF and DN was in the range 73.5%–106.3%, with a relative SD < 10%. The limits of detection and limits of quantification for dinotefuran, UF and DN were all 0.003 and 0.01 mg kg −1 , respectively. Dissipation experiments were conducted over 2015 and 2016 and showed a mean half-life of 40.8 days. Coffee processing procedures were performed as described for traditional household coffee processing in Ethiopia. Dinotefuran contents were reduced by 44.4%–86.7% with washing of coffee beans and the roasting process reduced these contents by 62.2%–100%. DN residues were not detected in roasted coffee beans before day 21 or in brewed coffee before day 35 and UF residues were not detected in brewed coffee before day 35. Kruskal–Wallis analyses indicated large variations in the stability of pesticide residues between processing methods (P ≤ 0.05). Reductions of pesticide concentrations with washing were also significantly lower than those following roasting (P = 0.0001) and brewing processes (P = 0.002). Moreover, processing factors were less than one for all processing stages, indicating reductions of pesticides contents for all processing stages. CONCLUSION: The cumulative effects of the three processing methods are of paramount importance with respect to an evaluation of the risks associated with the ingestion of pesticide residues, particularly those in coffee beans. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

N2  - Calpurnia aurea extracts are used in southern Ethiopia to protect stock against ticks. Acetone, hexane and water leaf extracts of C. aurea collected in southern Ethiopia were tested for repellent/attractant and acaricidal properties on unfed adult Rhipicephalus pulchellus ticks. In contrast to many other plant species evaluated, C. aurea extracts did not have repellent properties, but rather had a slight attractant capacity. With 20% and 10% acetone extracts, all ticks were either killed or their mobility severely compromised after 1 μl of extract was topically applied on the abdomen. At a 5% concentration, 85% of ticks were still affected. A 10% aqueous solution also had a marked effect. The results prove the efficacy of the traditional use of this extract and may lead to a product that can be used commercially to protect animals against tick infestation, under subsistence as well as industrialized conditions. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Samples of maize, teff, red pepper, and coffee (green bean and coffee bean with pulp) were collected from a local market in the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. Samples were analyzed for the occurrence of cypermethrin, permethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, DTT and its metabolites, and endosulfan (α, β). In the analytical procedure, the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) extraction methodology with dispersive solid phase extraction clean up (d-SPE) technique was applied. Validation of the QuEChERS method was satisfactory. Recovery percentages of most pesticides were in the range of 70% to 120%, with good repeatability (%relative standard deviation<20). The limit of detection and limit of quantification varied between 0.001μg/g and 0.092μg/g and between 0.002μg/g and 0.307μg/g, respectively. The main pesticides detected were DDT, endosulfan, cypermethrin, and permethrin. All of the pesticides analyzed were detected in red pepper and green coffee bean. Residues of DDT in coffee pulp significantly differed (p<0.01) from other food items except for red pepper. The concentration of pesticides in the food items varied from 0.011mg/kg to 1.115mg/kg. All food items contained 1 or more pesticides. Two-thirds of the samples had residues below corresponding maximum residue limits, and the remaining one-third of samples were above the maximum residue limits. These results indicate the need for a good pesticide monitoring program to evaluate consumer risk for the Ethiopian people. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:1294-1302. © 2014 SETAC.

N2  - Upper Awash Agro Industry Enterprises (UAAIE) is one of the major state farms in Ethiopia with known large-scale pesticide use. Although organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been applied for about three decades, no studies have been carried out on levels of residue in the region. In this work a fast selective pressurised liquid extraction (SPLE) methodology has successfully been applied for screening of 13 OCPs in 12 soil samples from different fields in UAAIE, which further strengthen this methodology. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were done using a dual column gas chromatography-electron capture detection system (GC-ECD) and a GC equipped with a mass spectrometer (MS), respectively. The main contaminants identified comprised of previously used persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and currently used insecticides. Low concentrations or non-detectable levels of certain OCPs (aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, and heptachlor) indicate a positive phasing out of these persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Similarly HCHs were found in few soils and at low concentrations. Endosulfans and DDTs were detected in substantial amounts in the soils with Σendosulfans up to 56 000 and ΣDDTs up to 230 ng g-1 dry weight, which is a threat to the surrounding and downstream ecosystems, especially considering that the investigated OCPs constituted 29 000 l of the 63 000 l of pesticide applied annually on the fields. Additional concerns must be raised concerning synergistic effects of all pesticides added. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - In Ethiopia, tef is one of the major staple crops used as a basic raw material  for food development such as stable bread called injera. Studies reported that imbalanced N fertilizer reduces the overall deliciousness of grains. Nowadays nitrogenous fertilizers are considered as the source of variation for the quality of injera, Ethiopian traditional flat bread. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted to assess the effects of N fertilizer rates (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 kg N ha-1) on grain nutrition and sensory quality of injera of three tef varieties of (Kora, Boset, and Asgori). The experiment was conducted in main cropping season in Randomized Complete Block Design with three replications and Di-ammonium Phosphate was used in the same dose. Crop attribute parameters were determined using standard methods. Sensory quality and color of injera were determined by panelists and injera eye software respectively. Results showed that only protein content increased with nitrogen rates, while carbohydrate decreased significantly at (P < 0.05). Kora at the control plot (K0) had better color, flavor, texture, and taste values of injera, but they decreased with nitrogen rates. Injera from white tef varieties had a better acceptance as compared with Asgori red tef variety. Injera eye software indicated that the color of injera was significantly affected by varieties. Kora had a higher (55.74) lightness value followed by Boset (54.71), and Asgori (51.26). Injera from the Asgori variety had a maximum red color. Kora and Boset had higher yellow color on the control plot, but for Asgori it increased with the nitrogen rate.

N2  - Multiple agricultural productions were a way of life for Ethiopian farmers.  However, it was known for low productivity due to improper resource allocation. Hence, the farm household is under food insecurity and earned a low annual income. To overcome these challenges, the present study used hierarchical-based cluster data envelopment analysis by collecting data from 152 sample households through structured questionnaires. The finding suggested that the farm households in the study area were characterized by the low level of technical efficiency in multiple agricultural productions, implying that most farmers were unable to keep up with the current production frontier and technologies. The study's key result is that hierarchical-based cluster data envelopment analysis is more efficient than traditional data envelopment analysis. Furthermore, farmers in the study area are technically inefficient. From the determinants of technical efficiency in multiple agriculture, access to credit and the fertility of farmland have a positive impact on technical efficiency, whereas the age of the household and distance from infrastructures have a negative impact. Based on the significant determinants of efficiency, the present work recommends government agencies and agricultural development planners must improve farmers' knowledge towards soil fertility management practices through the construction of soil bunds, tree planting, grass planting, fencing, and the use of natural fertilizer; expansion of microfinance to rural area; and construction of the road for the market facility in the study area. Additionally, changing farmers' knowledge towards the uses of integration of manure products from livestock as fertilizer inputs for crop production and residues of crops as livestock consumption were paramount important.

The aim of this study was to assess pesticide use on selected flower farms in Ethiopia. Serum cholinesterase levels in workers were used as a marker of pesticide exposure. This study was a cross-sectional study involving 588 workers from 15 different flower farms. It had a response rate of 95.5%. The participants included 277 males (mean age 26 years; 148 pesticide sprayers and 129 non-sprayers) and 311 females (mean age 25 years; 156 working in greenhouses and 155 working outside the greenhouses). The researchers undertook structured interviews, blood sampling, and walkthrough surveys. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression were used in the statistical analyses. A total of 154 different trade names of pesticides were found. Of them, 31 (27%) were classified as moderately hazardous by the WHO, and 9% were organophosphates. Serum levels of cholinesterase deviating from 50–140 Michel units were considered abnormal. Abnormal serum cholinesterase levels (above 140 Michel units) were found in 97 participants (16.5%, 95% confidence interval 13.7%–19.7%). There were no differences between the four job groups regarding cholinesterase levels. The high prevalence of abnormal serum cholinesterase levels might indicate the presence of pesticide intoxication. Thus, there is a need for routine monitoring of all workers exposed to pesticides, not only sprayers.

N2  - Background & Aims Hirmi Valley liver disease was first reported in 2001 in Tigray, Ethiopia. 591 cases, including 228 deaths, were reported up to December 2009. The pyrrolizidine alkaloid acetyllycopsamine was detected in stored grain and residents reported adding the pesticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) directly to their food stores. We aimed to characterise the clinical features of the disease, and explore the role of these chemicals in its aetiology. Methods 32 cases were examined and full clinical histories taken. Nine cases underwent liver biopsy in hospitals. Serum and urine samples were collected from cases and controls. Urine was analysed for acetyllycopsamine by UPLC-MS. Total DDT in serum was measured by ELISA. Hepatotoxicity of DDT and acetyllycopsamine alone or in combination was explored in C57BL/6J mice. Results Clinical presentation included epigastric pain, abdominal swelling, bloody diarrhoea, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and ascites. Histology revealed acute injury characterised by centrilobular necrosis or chronic injury with bile ductular reaction, cytomegaly and fibrosis but no hepatic vein occlusion. Acetyllycopsamine was detected in urine samples taken in the affected area with significantly greater concentrations in 45 cases than in 43 controls (p = 0.02). High levels of DDT (>125 ppb) were detected in 78% of serum samples. In mice, DDT (3 × 75 mg/kg) significantly increased the hepatotoxicity (plasma ALT, p = 0.0065) of acetyllycopsamine (750 mg/kg), and in combination induced liver pathology similar to Hirmi Valley liver disease including centrilobular necrosis and cytomegaly. Conclusions This novel form of disease appears to be caused by co-exposure to acetyllycopsamine and DDT. © 2013 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Pesticides are the parent compounds, their metabolites, and associated impurities of agricultural and health chemical inputs. If they are found at concentration levels higher than the standard limits, they have potential negative impacts on the ecosystem in general and on fish and humans in particular. This study investigates organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) residue occurrences in fish muscle and assesses their public health potential risks, in North West Ethiopia. The concentration of OCPs residue under gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD) was detected in 37.84% of fish muscle samples. The mean amounts detected were Endosalfan I, 341.50 ± 32.19 μg/kg; Endosalfan II, 36.01 ± 2.3 μg/kg; Endosalfan sulfate, 5.43 ± 4.06 μg/kg; 4, 4, DDE (4,4-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), 64.01 ± 9.08 μg /kg; 4,4, DDD (4,4-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane), 5.65 ± 3.12 μg/kg; and 4, 4, DDT (4,4-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), 1.58 ± 0.30 μg/kg. The mean concentration of Endosalfan I tested in fish muscle samples was higher than that of the permissible limit of different international standards. However, due to the low per capita consumption rate of fish origin food in Ethiopia, the health risk index (HRI) ranges from 0.002 to 0.1275, which shows there is no public health risk. This study highlights the possibility of chemical residue occurrence in fish food products, and hence pesticide use regulations and monitoring concentration levels should be implemented regularly to avoid human and environmental health risks.

N2  - The physiological role of human paraoxonase (PON), a serum enzyme that hydrolyzes organophosphate insecticides and nerve agents, is not clear. Of the three genes in the paraoxonase gene family, PON1 shows a polymorphism, Gln 192→Arg, governed by two common alleles named *Q and *R. These determine two different isoforms associated, respectively, with lower and higher activity towards paraoxon, a toxic metabolic product of the insecticide parathion. The *R allele has often been found associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. As human populations tend towards greater exposure to environmental changes, including changes in dietary habits and contact with insecticides or other toxic substances, health risks will change as well. In studying the prevention of these newly emerging risks, it could be important to know the distribution of the two alleles in the various world populations. In this paper we report on the genotype and allele frequencies of this polymorphism in different populations, most of which have never been examined for this polymorphism. Samples were taken from mainland Italy, Sardinia, Ethiopia, Benin, and Ecuador. The *R allele frequencies for the samples were: 0.313, 0.248, 0,408, 0.612, and 0.789, respectively. The data show a large variability in allele frequencies, and, in particular, that PON1 allele distribution depends on membership to different geographic populations.

N2  - A study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of Deltamethrin (0.4% impregnated targets and 1% pour-on formulation) in controlling tsetse and trypanosomosis was carried out in two selected 10 km × 10 km Universal Transverse Mercator Grids of the Southern Tsetse Eradication Project (STEP) area in the southern rift valley of Ethiopia. The Grids selected were H3 (site I) and G5 (site II) in two districts of the Wolaita Zone. The trial was underway from September 2003 to April 2004. The strategy followed to accomplish the trial was a pre-intervention phase (entomology and parasitology) and an intervention phase with insecticide (Deltamethrin 0.4%)-impregnated odour-baited targets in site I and Deltamethrin 1% 'pour-on' application to cattle in site II. The intervention phase was monitored on a monthly basis. Following the deployment of 460 targets at a density of 4 targets per km2 in trial site I, the relative abundance of tsetse fly (Glossina pallidipes) declined from a pre-intervention mean catch of 1.35 flies per trap per day to 0.05 flies per trap per day at final monitoring. These resulted in an 88.9% overall reduction. Similarly, an 83.25% reduction was recorded in the incidence of trypanosomosis in sentinel cattle as it dropped from 10.75% (first monitoring) to 1.8% (last monitoring). The corresponding measures of packed cell volume (PCV) have shown a significant improvement from a mean of 21.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 20.7-22.9) at first monitoring to 25.5% (95% CI: 24.3-26.7) of last monitoring (P < 0.01). In site II, the trial was started by spraying Deltamethrin 1% pour-on to 409 cattle at a rate of 1 ml/10 kg body weight. Pour-on treatment was repeated every month throughout the trial period. A sharp drop in the relative abundance of tsetse fly was revealed soon after. The catch was nil at fourth monitoring as it declined from 0.91 flies per trap per day of pre-intervention (P < 0.01). A 94.9% overall reduction was achieved. The incidence of trypanosomosis in sentinel cattle also declined from 10% (first monitoring) to 0.95% (last monitoring) with about 90.5% decline. An improvement in the overall mean PCV was seen as it rose from a mean of 24.1% (95% CI: 22.9-25.3) at first monitoring to 27.2% (95% CI: 26.2-28.1) at last monitoring which revealed a significant increase (P < 0.01) until the third monitoring and maintained a stable state thereafter. This work finally disclosed that a relatively better efficacy was attained by using Deltamethrin pour-on formulation than targets in controlling tsetse and trypanosomiosis. However, this difference did not prove an apparent significance (P > 0.05). So it is recommended to continue the current tsetse suppression by using the integrated approach of both techniques under consideration. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - Since Ethiopia is going through a rapid transformation of its agricultural sector, we assessed the human health and environmental risks due to the past use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) as well as the risks of the current pesticide use by farmers. A monitoring programme and risk assessment was carried out for the Wedecha-Belbela irrigation system in the Debra Zeit area. The Wedecha and Belbela rivers and adjacent temporary ponds were sampled and examined for the presence of OCPs between August and October 2014, while data on the current pesticide use by small- and large-scale farmers was collected by interviews. The usage patterns were evaluated for risks of using the river or temporary ponds as source of drinking water and for risks for the aquatic ecosystems in the river and ponds with the aid of the PRIMET_Registration_Ethiopa_1.1 model. The samples were collected in five sampling periods, and results indicate that most of the 18 target OCPs were not detected above the detection limit, while g-chlordane may pose chronic risks when surface water is used as drinking water. Endosulfan and heptachlor pose risks to aquatic organisms at second-tier level, while for heptachlor-epoxide B, g-chlordane and b-BHC only risks could be determined at the first tier due to a lack of data. For all nine pesticides used by small-scale farmers the calculated acute risks to humans were low. Second tier risk assessment for the aquatic ecosystem indicated that lambda-cyhalothrin, endosulfan, profenofos, and diazinon may pose high risks.

N2  - Dietary intake of fish containing organic contaminants poses a potential threat to human health. In the present work, an assessment has been carried out to look at the human health risk associated with consumption of fish contaminated with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyles (PCBs) in certain fish species collected from Lake Hawassa, Ethiopia. The health risk assessment was made by comparing the concentrations of OCPs and PCBs in fish muscle tissues with reference doses given in the USEPA guidelines. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), endosulfans, PCBs and chloridanes were identified in fish species collected from Lake Hawassa. The most predominant pesticides were DDTs, with mean concentrations of ∑DDT ranging from 19 to 56 ngg-1 wet weights. The highest concentrations of DDTs were found in Barbus intermedius, representing the highest trophic level. PCBs, DDT and endosulfan concentrations found in B. intermedius exceeded the reference dose for children between the ages of 0-1 year (with hazard index of above 1.0). Therefore, consumption of fish from a high trophic level (e.g. B. intermedius) from Lake Hawassa may pose a special health risk to children. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

N2  - Several hundred cases of Hirmi Valley Liver Disease (HVLD), an often fatal liver injury, occurred from 2001 to 2011 in a cluster of rural villages in Tigray, Ethiopia. HVLD is principally caused by contamination of the food supply with plant derived pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), with high exposure to the pesticide DDT among villagers increasing their susceptibility. In an untargeted global approach we aimed to identify metabolic changes induced by PA exposure through 1H NMR spectroscopic based metabolic profiling. We analysed spectra acquired from urine collected from HVLD cases and controls and a murine model of PA exposure and PA/DDT co-exposure, using multivariate partial least squares discriminant analysis. In the human models we identified changes in urinary concentrations of tyrosine, pyruvate, bile acids, N-acetylglycoproteins, N-methylnicotinamide and formate, hippurate, p-cresol sulphate, p-hydroxybenzoate and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid. Tyrosine and p-cresol sulphate were associated with both exposure and disease. Similar changes to tyrosine, one-carbon intermediates and microbial associated metabolites were observed in the mouse model, with tyrosine correlated with the extent of liver damage. These results provide mechanistic insight and implicate the gut microflora in the human response to challenge with toxins. Pathways identified here may be useful in translational research and as exposome signals.

N2  - The origins of myrrh and frankincense are traced to the Arabian Peninsula. According to Herodotus (5th century BC): "Arabia is the only country which produces frankincense, myrrh, cassia, and cinnamon.., the trees bearing the frankincense are guarded by winged serpents of small size and various colors." Diodorus Siculus wrote, in the second half of the first century BC, that "all of Arabia exudes a most delicate fragrance; even the seamen passing by Arabia can smell the strong fragrance that gives health and vigor." He also mentioned gold mines so pure that no smelting was necessary. The Magi, carrying myrrh, frankincense, and gold, came from the East: Arabia. The frankincense trade route, with transport by donkeys and later by camel caravans, reached Jerusalem and Egypt from the Dhofar region of what is today Oman, through Yemen, turning north to follow the Red Sea coast. It is likely that the same or similar species of the resin-bearing plants grew across the Red Sea in the area that is now Somalia and Ethiopia, while the collection of the gum resins was initiated in Arabia. Myrrh contributed much in the human welfare. Schistosomiasis was known in ancient Egypt since remote times. Haematuria with urinary bladder disturbances was mentioned in four Papyrus papers dated back to 1950-1900 BC, and Schistosoma ova was detected in a cirrhotic liver of a mummy from 1200 BC (Ruffer, 1910). Also, Fasciola eggs were detected in a mummy (Looss, 1896). Fascioliasis infected over 17 million people worldwide causing marked morbidity and mortality (Haseeb et al., 2002). Schistosomiasis affected over 200 million people in 74 countries and territories worldwide (WHO, 1999) causing several chronic complications. Both were incriminated to predispose or accompanied human hepatitis and predisposed to HCV (Wahib et al., 2006). Most zoonotic helminthes induced immune response (Nutman, 2001) characterized by producing of type 2 cytokines, Ig G1, IgG2, IgE antibodies and eosinophil and mast cell activation (Hoffman et al., 2002). Treatment of fascioliasis required high or drug multiple doses with side effect (Farid et al., 1990). In schistosomiasis, praziquantel (PZQ) in use for > 20 years was faced with low efficacy (Leishout et al., 1998), or with increased resistance (Coles et al., 1986; Watt et al., 1988; Herrera et al., 1994; Ismail et al., 1994; 1999; Tonelli et al., 1995; Stelma et al., 1995; Fallon et al., 1997; Bennett et al., 1997; Boisier et al., 1998; Periera et al., 1998; Kusel and Hagan, 1999; Liang et al., 2000; King et al., 2000; N'Goran et al., 2003; Raso et al., 2004), potentiality of carcinogenicity, genotoxicity (Rosenkranz et al., 1995), mutagenicity (Montero et al., 1993), big dose lethality and enhanced clastogenicity of environmental pollutants (Anwar, 1994). On the other hand, Nomicos (2007) in USA reported that since antiquity, the genus Commiphora is composed of more than 200 species, and exploited as a natural drug to treat pain, skin infections, inflammatory conditions, diarrhea, and periodontal diseases. He added that in more recent history, products derived from C. myrrha and various other species of Commiphora are becoming recognized to possess significant antiseptic, anesthetic, and antitumor properties. Traditional practice and evidence-based research have supported that these properties are directly attributable to terpenoids (especially furanoses-quiterpenes), the active compounds present in myrrh essential oil. Very recently, current studies have focused on applying clinical trial methodologies to validate its use as an antineoplastic, an antiparasitic agent, and as an adjunct in healing wounds. Weeks and Simpson (2007) in USA presented the molecular phylogeny of Commiphora, a predominantly tropical African, arid-adapted tree genus to test the monophyly of its taxonomic sections and to identify clades to help direct future study of this species-rich and geographically widespread taxon. The multiple fossil calibrations of Commiphora phylogeny proved that it is sister to Vietnamese Bursera tonkinensis and that its crown group radiation corresponds with the onset of the Miocene. Auffray (2007) in France studied the impact of two types of antioxidant on sebum squalene peroxidation by UV irradiation. The first type was free radical scavenger (Butyl hydroxyl toluene and an olive extract rich in hydroxytyrosol). The second type was the essential oil of C. myrrha, a singlet oxygen quencher. These properties were confirmed using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl test for anti-radical capacity and 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran test for the capacity to quench singlet oxygen. Also, the author extended an ex vivo method to classify the efficacy of cosmetics to protect squalene by collecting sebum in vivo and irradiating it in a controlled way. The squalene monohydroperoxide formation was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography. This method compared the efficiency of 3 antioxidants at 0.6% in a cosmetic formulation to protect squalene from photo oxidation. The data showed that essential oil of C. myrrha gave the best protection against squalene peroxidation, and that squalene peroxidation during solar exposure was mainly because of singlet oxygen and not due to free radical attack, and that sun care cosmetics should make use not only of free radical scavengers but also of singlet oxygen quenchers. This study aimed to review more than 70 out of hundreds papers (Pub-med-indexed for Medline) on the medical importance and safety of Commiphora molmol and other Commiphora species.

N2  - Wheat rust diseases pose one of the greatest threats to global food security, including subsistence farmers in Ethiopia. The fungal spores transmitting wheat rust are dispersed by wind and can remain infectious after dispersal over long distances. The emergence of new strains of wheat rust has exacerbated the risks of severe crop loss. We describe the construction and deployment of a near real-time early warning system (EWS) for two major wind-dispersed diseases of wheat crops in Ethiopia that combines existing environmental research infrastructures, newly developed tools and scientific expertise across multiple organisations in Ethiopia and the UK. The EWS encompasses a sophisticated framework that integrates field and mobile phone surveillance data, spore dispersal and disease environmental suitability forecasting, as well as communication to policy-makers, advisors and smallholder farmers. The system involves daily automated data flow between two continents during the wheat season in Ethiopia. The framework utilises expertise and environmental research infrastructures from within the cross-disciplinary spectrum of biology, agronomy, meteorology, computer science and telecommunications. The EWS successfully provided timely information to assist policy makers formulate decisions about allocation of limited stock of fungicide during the 2017 and 2018 wheat seasons. Wheat rust alerts and advisories were sent by short message service and reports to 10 000 development agents and approximately 275 000 smallholder farmers in Ethiopia who rely on wheat for subsistence and livelihood security. The framework represents one of the first advanced crop disease EWSs implemented in a developing country. It provides policy-makers, extension agents and farmers with timely, actionable information on priority diseases affecting a staple food crop. The framework together with the underpinning technologies are transferable to forecast wheat rusts in other regions and can be readily adapted for other wind-dispersed pests and disease of major agricultural crops.

N2  - Introduction Human embryo is well protected in the uterus by the embryonic membrane, although teratogens may cause developmental disruptions after maternal exposure to them during early pregnancy. Most of the risk factors contributing to the development of congenital anomalies are uncertain; however, genetic factors, environmental factors and multifactorial inheritance are found to be risk factors. Regardless of their clinical importance, there are little/no studies conducted directly related to predisposing risk factors in southwestern Ethiopia. Objective The study aimed to determine the associated risk factors with congenital anomalies among newborns in southwestern Ethiopia. Methods Case—control study was conducted on newborns and their mothers in six purposively selected hospitals in southwestern Ethiopia from May 2016 to May 2018. Data was collected after evaluation of the neonates for the presence of congenital anomalies using the standard pretested checklist. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. P <0.01 was set as statistically significant. Results Risk factors such as unidentified medicinal usage in the first three months of pregnancy (AOR = 3.435; 99% CI: 2.012–5.863), exposure to pesticide (AOR = 3.926; 99% CI: 1.266–12.176), passive smoking (AOR = 4.104; 99% CI: 1.892–8.901), surface water as sources of drinking (AOR = 2.073; 99% CI: 1.221–3.519), folic acid supplementation during the early pregnancy (AOR = 0.428; 99% CI: 0.247–0.740) were significantly associated with the congenital anomalies. Conclusions In this study, risk factors such as passive smoking, exposure to pesticides, chemicals and use of surface water as a source of drinking during early pregnancy had a significant association with congenital anomalies. There is a need to continuously provide health information for the community on how to prevent and control predisposing risk factors.

N2  - A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted for Ethiopian rose cultivation. The LCA covered the cradle-to-gate production of all inputs to Ethiopian rose cultivation up to, and including transport to the Ethiopian airport. Primary data were collected about materials and resources used as inputs to, and about the product outputs from 21 farms in 4 geographical regions (i.e. Holleta, Sebeta, Debre Ziet, and Ziway). The primary data were imported in, and analyzed with the SimaPro7.3 software. Data for the production of used inputs were taken from the EcoInvent®2.0 database. Emissions from input use on the farms were quantified based on estimates and emission factors from various studies and guidelines. The resulting life cycle inventory (LCI) table was next evaluated with the CML 2 baseline 2000. V2/world, 1990/characterization method to quantify the contribution of the rose cultivation chain to 10 environmental impact categories. The set of collected primary data was comprehensive and of high quality. The data point to an intensive use of fertilizers, pesticides, and greenhouse plastic. Production and use of these inputs also represent the major contributors in all environmental impact categories. The largest contribution comes from the production of the used fertilizers, specifically nitrogen-based fertilizers. The use of calcium nitrate dominates Abiotic Depletion (AD), Global Warming (GW), Human Toxicity (HT) and Marine Aquatic Ecotoxicity (MAET). It also makes a large contribution to Ozone Depletion (OD), Acidification (AD) and Fresh water Aquatic Ecotoxicity (FAET). Acidification (AC) and Eutrophication (EU) are dominated by the emission of fertilizers. The emissions from the use of pesticides, especially insecticides dominate Terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TE) and make a considerable contribution to Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity (FAET) and Photochemical Oxidation (PhO). There is no visible contribution from the use of pesticides to the other toxicity categories. Production and use of greenhouse plastic are another important contributors, and just a bit less than the contribution of calcium nitrate to Abiotic Depletion (AD). The results of this study clearly indicate nutrient management and emissions from pesticide use, especially insecticides, as a focus point for environmental optimization of the rose cultivation sector in Ethiopia. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The concentrations and biomagnifications of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites were examined in four fish species (Clarias gariepinus, Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zillii, and Carassius auratus) from Lake Ziway, Rift Valley, Ethiopia. Paired stomach content analysis, and stable isotope ratio of nitrogen (δ15N, ‰) and carbon (δ13C, ‰) were used to study the trophic position of the fish species in the lake. 4,4'-DDE, 4,4'-DDT and 4,4'-DDD were the main DDTs identified in the fish samples, with 4,4'-DDE as the most predominant metabolite, with mean concentration ranging from 1.4 to 17.8ngg-1 wet weight (ww). The concentrations of DDTs found in fish from Lake Ziway were, in general lower than those found in most studies carried out in other African Lakes. However, the presence of DDT in all tissue samples collected from all fish species in the lake indicates the magnitude of the incidence. Moreover, the observed mean 4,4'-DDE to 4,4'-DDT ratio below 1 in C. auratus from Lake Ziway may suggest a recent exposure of these species to DDT, indicating that a contamination source is still present. 4,4'-DDE was found to biomagnify in the fish species of the lake, and increases with trophic level, however, the biomagnification rate was generally lower than what has been reported from other areas. Significantly higher concentrations of 4,4'-DDE were found in the top consumer fish in Lake Ziway, C. gariepinus than in O. niloticus (t=2.6, P<0.01), T. zillii (t=2.5, P<0.02) and C. auratus (t=2.2, P<0.03). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The Global Monitoring Plan of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) was established to generate long-term data necessary for evaluating the effectiveness of regulatory measures at a global scale. After a decade of passive air monitoring (2008-2019), MONET is the first network to produce sufficient data for the analysis of long-term temporal trends of POPs in the African atmosphere. This study reports concentrations of 20 POPs (aldrin, chlordane, chlordecone, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, endosulfan, HBCDD, HCB, HCHs, heptachlor, hexabromobiphenyl, mirex, PBDEs, PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs, PeCB, PFOA, and PFOS) monitored in 9 countries (Congo, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mali, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria, and Sudan). As of January 1, 2019, concentrations were in the following ranges (pg/m3): 0.5-37.7 (∑6PCB), 0.006-0.724 (∑17PCDD/F), 0.05-5.5 (∑9PBDE), 0.6-11.3 (BDE 209), 0.1-1.8 (∑3HBCDD), 1.8-138 (∑6DDT), 0.1-24.3 (∑3endosulfan), 0.6-14.6 (∑4HCH), 9.1-26.4 (HCB), 13.8-18.2 (PeCB). Temporal trends indicate that concentrations of many POPs (PCBs, DDT, HCHs, endosulfan) have declined significantly over the past 10 years, though the rate was slow at some sites. Concentrations of other POPs such as PCDD/Fs and PBDEs have not changed significantly over the past decade and are in fact increasing at some sites, attributed to the prevalence of open burning of waste (particularly e-waste) across Africa. Modeled airflow back-trajectories suggest that the elevated concentrations at some sites are primarily due to sustained local emissions, while the low concentrations measured at Mt. Kenya represent the continental background level and are primarily influenced by long-range transport.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles stephensiwas known to be local malaria vector in South East  Asia but recently found expanding to the horn of Africa including urban areas of Ethiopia. Recent studies indicated that An. stephensihave high level of insecticide resistance to pyrethroid (Deltamethrin, permethrin and alpha-cypermethrin), Carbamates (Bendiocarb and Propoxur) and organophosphates (pirimiphos-methyl). The aim, of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of An. stephensi from Diredawa against broflanilide, chlorfenapyr, clothianidin and pyriproxyfen. METHODS: A standard diagnostic doses of broflanilide, chlorfenapyr, clothianidin and pyriproxyfen were tested, using the revised WHO bottle bioassay test protocol, against wild adult An. stephensieared from larval collections from urban artificial larval habitats in Dire Dawa. RESULTS: The 60 minutes knock down result indicated 85%, 76% and 14% against brofilanilide, clothianidin and clorfenapyr respectively. No KD was observed in controls and PPF. Complete mortality of An.stephensiat 24 hours was observed against broflanilide (9ug/bottle) and clothiandin (10ug/bottle). Also 66% mortality at 24 h and 100% mortality at 48 h post exposure against clorfenapyr (100ug/bottle) were observed. In case of PPF (100ug/bottle), no mortality at 24 h, 11% at 48 h. and 15% at 72 h were recorded and no mortality in all controls.In addition, 100% of oviposition were observed in controls and no oviposition were observed in PPF exposed mosquitoes. These results suggest that all three types of insecticides namely: Broflanilide, Chlorfenapyr and Clothianidin showed higher mortality than pyriproxyfen. CONCLUSION: Full susceptibility to the three novel insecticides were observed and full oviposition inhibition were observed in wild reared larvae An. stephensi exposed to PPF. Therefore, this study recommends using these novel insecticides to control An. stephensi in Ethiopia.

N2  - Crops respond differently to soil nutrients because of climate, soil, and  management. This study aimed to determine the most important nutrients for tef production. The experiment was conducted over two production seasons. All (NPKSZnB), All-B, All-Zn, All-S, All-K, All-P, All-N, RNP, RNP+Sx1, and no fertilizer treatments were applied. The pre-planning soil status of the study sites, available P concentrations during the rainy season are between 5.1 and 8.9 mg kg-1, however, 21.4 mg kg-1 of available P is observed during irrigation. In rain-fed production systems, the mean soil N concentrations are 0.12% in nitisols and 0.15% in vertosols, whereas in irrigation production systems, it is 0.14% in nitiosols. The grain yield significantly (p ≤ 0.01) varied with the omission of nutrients during the production season. However, there was no significant (p<0.05) decrease in yield due to the omission of KSZnB nutrients. The lowest mean grain yields of 342 kg ha-1 (nitisols) and 491 kg ha-1 (vertosols) were obtained from the no fertilizer treatment. Nitrogen omission decreased yields by 49 and 65% in nitisols and vertosols under the rainy season, respectively, whereas a 19% yield decrease was also observed in the irrigation season. A 10% yield decrease was observed from the P omitted treatment in the rainy season. Thus, N is the primary limiting nutrient to yield in both production seasons, while P is also a yield-limiting nutrient in nitisols. Thus, the government should import the right kind of fertilizer to boost crop productivity in Ethiopia. The required plant nutrients should be periodically monitored in farming systems.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Insecticide-treated bed nets are often used as a physical barrier  to prevent infection of malaria. In Sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most important ways of reducing the malaria burden is the utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets. However, there is no sufficient information on the utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets and their associated factors in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets and associated factors among households in Pawie District, Benshangul Gumuz, North West Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in the Pawie district to identify factors influencing the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Diverse household groups were engaged, and data were collected using a structured questionnaire and observational checklists by trained interviewers. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 23. Advanced statistical methods, including binary and multi-variable logistic regression, were employed to examine the factors associated with ITN utilization. RESULTS: From the total of 633 respondents, more than two third, 438 (69.2% with 95% CI: 65.2%, 72.5%) had utilized insecticide-treated bed nets during the early morning of the interview. Approximately 297 respondents (67.8%) successfully hung their insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) properly during the early morning of observation. In this study, 406 respondents (64.1%, 95% CI: 60.5, 68.1) showed a solid understanding of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) utilization. Key predictors for the utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) included age (AOR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.11, 3.13, p = 0.019), educational status (AOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.26, 0.77, p = 0.008), knowledge level (AOR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.89, 3.81, p < 0.001), and family size (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.31, 2.74, p = 0.001). All of these variables were found to be statistically significant for the utilization of insecticide-treated bed net. CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of the insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) remains low in the study area. To address this, it is crucial to raise public awareness and improve utilization of the insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to decrease malaria transmission in the district. Ongoing health education initiatives, including demonstrations on the proper way to hang bed nets, will be essential in fostering better practices and improving community health outcomes.

N2  - Tomato yield can be increased by the application of optimum water and fertilizer.  A field experiment was conducted in Efratana Gidim district, North Shewa, Amhara, Ethiopia, during 2019 and 2020. The objective was to determine the nitrogen (N) rate and irrigation regime for optimum tomato yield and water use efficiency (WUE). The experiment consisted of three-irrigation regimes (75% ETc (Evapotranspiration from the crop), 100% ETc, and 125% ETc) and four nitrogen (N) rates (control; i.e. without N application(1), 46 kg N ha(-1), 92 kg N ha(-1), and 138 kg N ha(-1)). The treatments were laid out in a split-plot design with four replications. The Irrigation regime were assigned to the main plot, while the N rate were assigned to the subplot. Data on growth, yield, and yield-related traits of tomatoes, include; plant height, number of fruit clusters per plant, fruit length, fruit diameter, number of marketable fruits, number of un-marketable fruits, the total number of fruits, marketable fruit yield, un-marketable fruit yield, total yield were collected. The data were subjected to analysis of variance using R studio. The results indicated that the experimental site had low total N content, and the application of N fertilizer significantly improved tomato yield. Increasing irrigation depth also significantly increased tomato yield. The result indicated that the highest mean marketable fruit yield (35,903 kg ha(-1)) was obtained from the combined application of 125% ETc with 92 kg N ha(-1), while the lowest (13,655 kg ha(-1)) marketable fruit yield was obtained from 75% ETc with 92 kg N ha(-1). The analysis of variance showed that the highest (5.4 kg m(-3)) WUE recorded from 75% ETc with 46 kg N ha(-1) increased WUE by 77% (2.4 kg m(-3)) compared with the lowest (2.3 kg m(-3)) WUE recorded from 125% ETc with 0 kg N ha(-1). The partial budget analysis also indicated that the highest net benefit (266,272 ETB (Ethiopian Birr) ha(-1)) and an acceptable marginal rate of return (1240%) for the invested capital was recorded from the combined application of 125% ETc with 92 kg N ha(-1). Therefore, the application of 125% ETc with 92 kg N ha(-1) resulted in the highest net benefit.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) has been the main tool used to control  malaria. Reducing the life span and the density of the vector mosquitoes are direct effects of IRS towards restricting malaria transmission. Residents must not wash or re-plaster walls after the spray application for at least 6 months to fight against malaria with IRS. This study sought to assess the alteration of the sprayed wall after the IRS operation and associated factors among households in the Boricha district. METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 608 households selected using multi-stage sampling. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were analysed by SPSS version 25. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was done. Finally, the strength of the association was measured based on AOR with 95% CI and statistical significance was declared at a p-value less than 0.05. RESULT: From the total of 608 sprayed houses included in the study, 37.3% (95% CI: 33.41% - 41.15%) were found to have altered sprayed walls. The highest class of wealth index category (AOR = 2.50; 95% CI: 1.19, 5.16), low level of comprehensive knowledge about IRS (AOR = 6.08; 95% CI: 3.37, 10.94), did not get information within 2 weeks before spray (AOR = 2.09; 95% CI: 1.43, 3.05), absence of supervision after the spray operation (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.27, 2.73) and walking distance to nearest health facility (AOR = 2.39; 95% CI: 1.63, 3.35) remained significant factors of altering of the sprayed wall after IRS. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of alteration was relatively high. The highest socio-economic status, poor knowledge about indoor residual spraying, lack of information about IRS within two weeks before spray, absence of supervision after IRS, and walking distance of more than 30 min to reach the nearest health post were the factors affecting the alteration status of the sprayed wall. Future efforts to focus on successive awareness creation activities should be done before and after IRS operation to the community by concerned bodies.

N2  - Increasing global food insecurity amidst a growing population and diminishing  production resources renders the currently dominant linear production model insufficient to combat such challenges. Hence, a circular bioeconomy (CBE) model that ensures more conservative use of resources has become essential. Specifically, a CBE model that focuses on recycling and reusing organic waste is essential to close nutrient loops and establish more resilient rural-urban nexus food systems. However, the CBE status quo in many African food systems is not established. Moreover, scientific evidence on CBE in Africa is almost inexistent, thus limiting policy guidance to achieving circular food systems. Using a sample of about 2,100 farmers and consumers from key food value chains (cassava in Rwanda, coffee in DRC, and bananas in Ethiopia), we explored existing CBE practices; awareness, knowledge, and support for CBE practices; consumers' opinions on eating foods grown on processed organic waste (CBE fertilizers), and determinants of such opinions. We analysed data in Stata, first descriptively, and then econometrically using the ordered logistic regression, whose proportional odds assumption was violated, thus resorting to the generalized ordered logistic regression. Results show that communities practice aspects of CBE, mainly composting, and are broadly aware, knowledgeable, supportive of CBE practices, and would broadly accept eating foods grown CBE fertilizers. Households with heads that used mobile phones, or whose heads were older, or married, or had a better education and agricultural incomes were more likely to strongly agree that they were knowledgeable and supportive of CBE practices and would eat CBE foods (foods grown on processed organic waste). However, the reverse was true for households that were severely food insecure or lived farther from towns. Rwandan and Ethiopian households compared to DRC were less likely to eat CB foods. Policies to stimulate CBE investments in all three countries were largely absent, and quality scientific evidence to guide their development and implementation is currently insufficient.

N2  - BACKGROUND: An increasing number of malaria-endemic African countries are rapidly  scaling up malaria prevention and treatment. To have an initial estimate of the impact of these efforts, time trends in health facility records were evaluated in selected districts in Ethiopia and Rwanda, where long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) had been distributed nationwide by 2007. METHODS: In Ethiopia, a stratified convenience sample covered four major regions where (moderately) endemic malaria occurs. In Rwanda, two districts were sampled in all five provinces, with one rural health centre and one rural hospital selected in each district. The main impact indicator was percentage change in number of in-patient malaria cases and deaths in children < 5 years old prior to (2001-2005/6) and after (2007) nationwide implementation of LLIN and ACT. RESULTS: In-patient malaria cases and deaths in children < 5 years old in Rwanda fell by 55% and 67%, respectively, and in Ethiopia by 73% and 62%. Over this same time period, non-malaria cases and deaths generally remained stable or increased. CONCLUSION: Initial evidence indicated that the combination of mass distribution of LLIN to all children < 5 years or all households and nationwide distribution of ACT in the public sector was associated with substantial declines of in-patient malaria cases and deaths in Rwanda and Ethiopia. Clinic-based data was a useful tool for local monitoring of the impact of malaria programmes.

N2  - Pesticides have posed health risks to consumers and the ecosystems in different  parts of the world, including Ethiopia, and researchers recommend continual assessments of pesticide residues in food items and ecosystems to know the level of risks. This study aimed to quantify the pesticide residues in samples of cabbage and fish and their risks to humans and the ecosystems. The cabbage samples were collected from April to May 2023 from 3 market centers, and the fish samples were collected in June 2023 from two fish ponds of Fogera District of Ethiopia using appropriate sampling procedures, extracted using the modified QuEChERS methods, and analyzed using a triple quadrupole GC/MS technique to quantify the pesticide residues and level the risks to humans and the ecosystems. The findings of the present study confirmed that all the samples of cabbage and fish were contaminated with pesticide residues. More than 44% and 37% of pesticide residues detected in both cabbage and fish samples were organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides, respectively. Furthermore, 92.86% of the pesticide residues and 96.43% of the maximum pesticide residues in cabbage exceeded the MRL and the TQ set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. The sum total hazard indices of the pesticide residues in the cabbage (22.320) and fish (43.071) were much higher than the threshold value. Though Fogera District is a potential area for fish production in ponds, agricultural pesticides are a threat to the sector. Establishing an efficient system of monitoring for the pesticide supply chain and application procedures, choosing the appropriate pesticide types, timing in spraying, and establishing pesticide-free buffer zones are crucial steps in mitigating the negative effects of pesticides in the area.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Adequate coverage and proper use of long-lasting insecticidal nets  (LLINs) and indoor residual spaying (IRS) reduce density of indoor-resting mosquitoes, man-mosquito contact and malaria infection. However, distribution, ownership and usage of the interventions may vary among households in a malarious area, which in turn limits the impact of interventions on the transmission of malaria. A study was undertaken to assess distribution and utilization of LLINs and IRS in a malarious village of north-western Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 352 randomly selected households in Jiga Yelmdar village, Jabi Tehnan District of north-western Ethiopia were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The most important questions included distribution and utilization of LLINs/IRS and knowledge by the households of malaria and the interventions. RESULTS: More than 99% of the respondents had information about malaria. About 97% of the households had at least one LLIN and 89.3% of houses had been treated with IRS within the previous six months. Only 58.2% of the LLIN-owning households had used the nets the previous night. Not being a malaria transmission season was the main reason cited by 69.7% of the households for not using their LLINs the previous night. The most preferred malaria control strategy in the village was LLINs (cited by 71.1%) followed by IRS (cited by 14.5%). About 29% of the households had a history of malaria within the previous six months and the great majority of them (86.3%) sought treatment at the Jiga Yelmdar Health Post or Jiga Health Centre. CONCLUSION: Residents of Jiga Yelmdar village were knowledgeable about malaria and the control strategies of the disease such as LLINs and IRS. Although LLIN use is their most preferred strategy, the compliance rate was low which probably contributed to the 29% of household-level malaria infection in the village within the previous six months. This indicates the need for improved compliance to LLINs and IRS in the village.

N2  - Disruptions of key food and fertilizer exports from Russia and Ukraine have  exposed many countries to challenges accessing some commodities since these countries' war began. We evaluated the short-term, external, and direct impacts of disruptions of six food commodities and three types of fertilizer supplies from Russia and Ukraine on food access for all trading partners of the two countries by applying a set of trade and socioeconomic indicators. We found that the external food supplies of 279 countries and territories were affected to varying degrees; 24 countries-especially Georgia, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Mongolia-are extremely vulnerable because they depend almost entirely on a variety of food imports from Russia and Ukraine. Access to fertilizers was affected in 136 countries and territories, particularly Estonia (potassic fertilizer), Mongolia (nitrogenous fertilizers), Kazakhstan (mixed fertilizers), and Brazil, the United States, China, and India (all types of fertilizers). An integrated assessment of countries' import types, purchasing power parity per capita, and populations indicated that the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Pakistan are most vulnerable to such supply disruptions. Development of research into diversification and decentralization strategies for food access is needed to guide stable food supply policies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has shown notable progress in reducing the burden of malaria  over the past two decades. Because of this progress, the country has shifted efforts from control to elimination of malaria. This study was conducted to analyse the malaria epidemiology and stratification of incidence in the malaria elimination setting in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to analyse the epidemiology of malaria by reviewing the district health office data from 2013 to 2019 in Harari Region. In addition, three years of sub-district level malaria data were used to stratify the malaria transmission intensity. Malaria interventions (Long-lasting insecticidal nets [LLIN] and indoor residual spraying [IRS]) employed were reviewed to analyse the intervention coverage at the Regional level. Descriptive statistics were used to show the malaria transmission in terms of years, season and species of the malaria parasite. Incidence rate per 1000 population and death rate per 1 000 000 population at risk were computed using the total population of each year. RESULTS: In the Harari Region, malaria incidence showed a more pronounced declining trend from 2017 to 2019. Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax and mixed infections accounted for 69.2%, 30.6% and 0.2% of the cases, respectively. There was an increment in malaria intervention coverage and improved malaria diagnosis. In the year 2019 the coverage of LLIN and IRS in the Region were 93.4% and 85.1% respectively. The annual malaria incidence rate dropped from 42.9 cases per 1000 population in 2013 to 6.7 cases per 1000 population in 2019. Malaria-related deaths decreased from 4.7 deaths per 1 000 000 people annually in 2013 to zero, and there have been no deaths reported since 2015. The malaria risk appears to be heterogeneous and varies between districts. A higher number of malaria cases were recorded in Erer and Jenella districts, which constitute 62% of the cases in the Region. According to the sub-district level malaria stratification, there was shrinkage in the malaria transmission map and about 70% of the sub-districts have achieved elimination targets. CONCLUSIONS: In the Harari Region, malaria morbidity and mortality have been significantly declined. Thus, if this achievement is sustained and scaling-up of the existing malaria prevention and control strategies by focusing on those populations living in the higher malaria transmission districts and sub-districts, planning of malaria elimination from the study area might be feasible.

N2  - Smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) currently grow rainfed maize with  limited inputs including fertilizer. Climate change may exacerbate current production constraints. Crop models can help quantify the potential impact of climate change on maize yields, but a comprehensive multimodel assessment of simulation accuracy and uncertainty in these low-input systems is currently lacking. We evaluated the impact of varying [CO(2) ], temperature and rainfall conditions on maize yield, for different nitrogen (N) inputs (0, 80, 160 kg N/ha) for five environments in SSA, including cool subhumid Ethiopia, cool semi-arid Rwanda, hot subhumid Ghana and hot semi-arid Mali and Benin using an ensemble of 25 maize models. Models were calibrated with measured grain yield, plant biomass, plant N, leaf area index, harvest index and in-season soil water content from 2-year experiments in each country to assess their ability to simulate observed yield. Simulated responses to climate change factors were explored and compared between models. Calibrated models reproduced measured grain yield variations well with average relative root mean square error of 26%, although uncertainty in model prediction was substantial (CV = 28%). Model ensembles gave greater accuracy than any model taken at random. Nitrogen fertilization controlled the response to variations in [CO(2) ], temperature and rainfall. Without N fertilizer input, maize (a) benefited less from an increase in atmospheric [CO(2) ]; (b) was less affected by higher temperature or decreasing rainfall; and (c) was more affected by increased rainfall because N leaching was more critical. The model intercomparison revealed that simulation of daily soil N supply and N leaching plays a crucial role in simulating climate change impacts for low-input systems. Climate change and N input interactions have strong implications for the design of robust adaptation approaches across SSA, because the impact of climate change in low input systems will be modified if farmers intensify maize production with balanced nutrient management.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Co-infection of malaria with helminths poses significant risks,  including fetomaternal hemorrhage, fetal growth retardation, spontaneous abortion, and preterm delivery. However, there is a lack of community studies to demonstrate the prevalence of co-infection of helminths with Plasmodium and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and associated factors among pregnant women in Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 287 randomly selected pregnant women in the Abaya district from September to December 2022. Data were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Blood and stool samples were collected from each pregnant woman and data analysis was performed using SPSS. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify associated factors. RESULTS: The co-infection prevalence of Plasmodium and STH was 19.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.92-24.08%), where STHs were 40.6% (95% CI: 34.9-46.3%) and Plasmodium was 32.4% (95% CI: 27-37.8%). Hookworm and Plasmodium falciparum were the most commonly identified parasite species. Factors significantly associated with co-infection with Plasmodium and STH included the habit of eating soil (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.36-5.34), not using insecticide-treated bed nets (AOR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.76-6.85), living near stagnant water (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.07-4.64), and rural residence (AOR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.07-5.97). CONCLUSIONS: Interventions should prioritize enhancing sanitation, educating pregnant women on the use of insecticide-treated bed nets, avoiding eating soil, and eliminating stagnant water near homes. More research should be conducted on the area using more advanced methods.

N2  - Biochar is a carbon-rich product, which is processed by pyrolyzing biomass to  improve soil properties and maintain environmental sustainability. This study aim was to investigate the effect of biochar and inorganic fertilizer on soil properties, growth, and yield. Four treatments and four replications have been used for the experimental plots using Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). Soil physiochemical properties have been investigated based on soil samples within 0-30 cm depth in each plot. The two types of biochar (grass and chat waste) have been used for the treatments. The pyrolyzing temperature required for grass and chat waste is 250°C and 1100°C, respectively. The plant height, total yield, and the marketable and nonmarketable yield of onion have been examined. The analysis showed that treatment with grass biochar and inorganic fertilizer had a similar effect on soil properties but chat (Catha edulis) biochar had a lower effect on soil properties. The total yield and days to 70% maturity have been increased due to the cumulative treatment of grass biochar and inorganic fertilizer. The biochar of grass and inorganic fertilizer have been significantly increased in marketable bulb yield, but unmarketable yield becomes decreased. The chat waste and controlled treatments shown an increased unmarketable yield and declined marketable bulb yield. Overall, biochar can substitute the inorganic fertilizer, which can help to improve the w soil fertility and environmental sustainability. Therefore, biochar has a win-win solution.

N2  - Due to continuous cultivation, high soil acidity, and low nutrient inputs, soil  fertility depletion has been a major threat to northwest Ethiopia's crop productivity and food security. This study aimed to examine the effects of vermicompost and lime rates on soil properties and malt barley (Hordeum distichum L.) productivity under a furrow irrigation system on acidic soil in the Mecha district, northwest Ethiopia. The treatments were combinations of three levels of vermicompost (0, 2.66-, and 5.31-tons ha-1) and three levels of lime (0-, 2.16-, and 3.24-tons ha-1) arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The results showed that the integrated application of 5.31 tons of vermicompost and 3.24 tons of lime ha-1 provided the highest soil pH (6.20), available phosphorus (8.55 mg kg-1), total nitrogen (0.25%), and organic carbon (3.40%). On the other hand, adding vermicompost and lime in combination or separately noticeably decreased the exchangeable acidity and aluminum toxicity. Besides, the integrated application of 5.31 tons vermicompost (VC) and 3.24 tons lime (L ha-1 provided the highest dry biomass (12.22 tons ha-1), grain yield (5.30 tons ha-1), and net benefit (197, 246 Ethiopian Birr (ETB). Overall, the integrated application of vermicompost and lime can substantially increase soil fertility and crop yields. However, this study needs further testing and validation at varied rates in other areas.

N2  - Soil fertility provides the foundation for nutritious food production and  resilient and sustainable livelihoods. A comprehensive survey and summit meeting were conducted with the aims of understanding barriers to enhancing soil fertility in sub-Saharan Africa and providing evidence-based recommendations. The focus regions were West Africa, East Africa, the Great Lakes region, and Ethiopia. Overall recommendations were developed with four emerging themes: (1) strengthening inorganic fertilizer-based systems, (2) access to and use of quality organic inputs, (3) capacity building along the entire knowledge-transfer value chain, and (4) strengthening farming systems research and development across biophysical and socio-economic factors. The evidence-based process and methodology for prioritizing these recommendations makes these findings useful for setting out action plans for future investments and strategies. Access to inorganic fertilizer, its use, and related implementation issues were prominent considerations; nevertheless, biophysical and socio-economic barriers and solutions were identified as equally important to building soil fertility and natural resources. Soil management initiatives should focus on providing holistic solutions covering both biophysical and socio-economic aspects along the entire value chain of actors and creating an enabling environment for adoption. A broader view of soil fertility improvement using all available options including both inorganic and organic sources of nutrients and farming system approaches are highly recommended.

N2  - Due to low adoption and sub-optimal fertilizer use and planting density  recommendation in maize, redesigning and testing these technologies are required. The study was conducted to evaluate redesigned fertilizer use of maize in two pant densities (32,443 and 53,333 plants ha-1 in Central Rift Valley (CRV); 27724 and 62,000 plants ha-1 in Jimma) on farmers' fields in contrasting agro-ecologies of Ethiopia. The on-farm study was conducted in the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons with 3 × 2 fertilizer and plant density, factors in both regions of Ethiopia. In redesigned fertilizer use, nutrients were estimated based on the target yield. In this study, 40.8, 0.0, and 12.2 kg ha-1 N, P, and K were estimated for the redesigned fertilizer use in CRV (50% of water-limited potential yield (Yw) = 3.1 t ha-1) whereas in Jimma (50% of Yw = 7.5 t ha-1) 149.8, 9, 130.6 kg ha-1 N, P and K were estimated to produce the 50% of Yw. Linear mixed modeling was used to assess the effect of fertilizer-plant density treatments on maize yield and nutrient use efficiency. The result revealed that the average estimated maize yield for WOF, FFU, and RDFU fertilizer treatments were 2.6, 3.6, and 4.5 t ha-1 under current plant density (32,443 plants ha-1) in CRV whereas the average yields of these treatments were 3.2, 4.5 and 4.5 t ha-1 respectively when maize was grown with redesigned plant density (53,333 plants ha-1) in the same location. The average maize yield with WOF, FFU, and RDFU were 3.0, 4.6, and 4.6 t ha-1 with 27,774 plants ha-1 plant density in Jimma whereas the average maize yields over the two seasons with the same treatments were 4.3, 6.0 and 8.0 t ha-1 respectively when the crop is planted with 62,000 plants ha-1 plant density. The RDFU and redesigned plant density resulted in significantly higher yield compared to their respective control CRV but RDFU significantly increased maize yield when it was planted at redesigned (62,000 plant ha-1) in Jimma. FFU and RDFU were economically viable and redesigned plant density was also a cheaper means of improving maize productivity, especially in the Jimma region. Soil organic carbon and N were closely related to the grain yield response of maize compared to other soil factors. In conclusion, this investigation gives an insight into the importance of redesigned fertilizer use and redesigned plant density for improving maize productivity and thereby narrowing the yield gaps of the crop in high maize potential regions in Ethiopia like Jimma.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite its significant application, DDT and its metabolites pose a  potential threat to the environment. Therefore, data on environmental and health concerns must thus be investigated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the environmental and human health risks posed by DDT and its metabolites in Ethiopian surface waters. METHODS: The total amount of DDT and its metabolites consumed as a sum (∑DDT) is calculated by considering their equivalent toxicity. To calculate the human risk from drinking contaminated water, the maximum concentrations in all of Ethiopia's surface waterways were pooled. The average concentration values were added to calculate the human risk from consuming fish contaminated with ∑DDT. Similarly, ∑DDT residues in water can be used to predict the potential environmental risk. RESULTS: A higher level of ∑DDT in surface water was detected in Gilgel Gibe I hydroelectric dam reservoir and its tributaries with an average concentration of 640 ng/l. There is no health risk associated with drinking these surface waters because the concentrations of ∑DDT were below the WHO's recommended level. In fish samples, B. intermedius accumulated a higher level of ∑DDT (21.47 ng/g ww). With the exception of local infants, ∑DDT does not pose a non-carcinogenic risk to any age group. However, consuming fish contaminated with ∑DDT poses an unacceptable risk of cancer to all age categories. The risk posed by ∑DDT on aquatic species is highly likely. The bioaccumulation factor (BAF) value indicates that fish tissue does not absorb ∑DDT directly from the water. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ∑DDT would link to both historical pollution and their current application in vector control. Ecosystems are frequently exposed to chemical mixes later in life; thus, rather than focusing on the ideal case of exposure to a single toxin, future studies can examine the mixture toxicity of numerous organic contaminants.

METHODS: Across sectional study was conducted in June 2020 using 240 blood samples, 140 from the exposed small-scale farmers (ESSFs) and 100 from non-exposed small-scale farmers (NESSFs). The blood sample analysis was mad for 5 organochlorines (OCs) and 3 synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) pesticides by gas-liquid chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) methods. Extraction, and clean up of the samples were made by using standard analytical methods. To define the relationships between the outcomes and explanatory variables, logistic regression models were used. RESULTS: The results shows that p,p'-DDT, heptachlor and deltamethrin were the most frequently detected pesticides with 96.4%, 95%, and 100% in both ESSFs and NESSFs, respectively. The ESSFs blood samples have shown the highest mean concentrations of permethrin and p,p'-DDT(1.26 ± 0.15) and (0.28 ± 0.4) mgL(-1), respectively. SSFs under the age of 40 were 21% less likely to be exposed to permethrin than those above the age of 40 (Adjusted Odd Ratio, AOR, 0.21; 95% CI: 0.1-0.44). Male SSFs were 17 times more likely to be exposed to heptachlor than females (AOR, 17.36; 95%CI: 7.34-41.09) and farmers with no formal education were 18 times more likely to be exposed to deltamethrin than those with primary schools and beyond (AOR, 18.1; 95 %CI: 4.53-72.06). Furthermore, SSFs that did not use PPE appropriately were 3.6 and 6.21 times more likely to be exposed to cypermethrin (AOR, 3.6; 95%CI: 1.94-6.54) and p,p'-DDE(AOR, 6.21; 95%CI: 3.38-11.41) blood levels than those who did, respectively. SSFs that perform different activities like eating and drinking (11%), chewing (10%), and diverse activities (8%) were more likely to be exposed to p,p'-DDT than those farmers who didn't use pesticides. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a high concentration p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, heptachlor, cypermethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin in the blood of small scale farmers. The older age, less education, and farmers with inappropriate PPE use are more likely exposed to pesticides.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Even though several measures have been taken to eliminate malaria,  its burden remains persistently high in Sub-Saharan Africa. More than 125 million pregnant women are at risk of getting malaria per year. There is a scarcity of community based evidence on malaria prevalence among pregnant women and associated factors in Northwest Ethiopia. This study aimed to generate evidence on the prevalence and associated factors of malaria among pregnant women in East Dembia district, North West Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March to June 2022 in East Dembia district, Northwest Ethiopia. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 821 pregnant women. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Malaria was diagnosed using rapid diagnostic testing. The data was entered using EPI info version 7 and transferred to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive statistics were presented using frequency and percentages. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with malaria infection among pregnant women. Variables having p-value < 0.2 were considered in the multivariable analysis. And a p value of < 0.05 was used as the cut-off value for statistical significance in the multivariable models. Adjusted odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval was used to measure the strength of the association. RESULTS: In this study, 111 (14%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 10.20-19.40%) of the participants were found to have malaria. Among these, 82 (73.80%) of the parasite-positive pregnant women were infected with Plasmodium falciparum, and the remaining 23 (20.72%) and 6 (5.41%) were infected with Plasmodium vivax and mixed species respectively. In the multivariate analysis; unprotected source of water (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 14.99; 95% CI: 1.08-207.50), utilization insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) (AOR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.03-0.49) stagnant water less than 1Killo meter (KM) distance from home (AOR: 3.52; 95% CI: 1.16-10.74), ownership bed net (AOR: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.04-0.70) were significantly associated with malaria among pregnant women. CONCLUSION: Malaria is still a public health problem among pregnant women in East Dembia district. The present study indicated that adequate distribution of bed net, its community ownership, and eradication of stagnant water in regular basis might be helpful to prevent and control malaria. In addition, screening pregnant women for asymptomatic malaria infection and distribution of proper utilization of bed nets shall be provided.

N2  - BACKGROUND: As Sub-Saharan African country urban malaria is potential catastrophe  in Ethiopia, particularly in relation to rapidly growing small towns, which requires updating the epidemiology of malaria. There was lack of information regarding the study area, hence this study was designed to determine the prevalence of malaria and associated risk factors in Damboya town. METHODS: A Community-based cross-sectional study was carried from March 7 to May 29, 2023 among 422 randomly selected participants. Prevalence of malaria was determined using microscopic examination of thick and thin smear and rapid diagnostic test using kits to standard of the manufacturer. Pretested structured questionnaire was employed to collect socio-demographic data and associated risk factors. Data were entered in Epi data 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 25 software. Factors associated with malaria was analyzed using bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression. The strength of the association was determined by computing Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) at Malaria is one of the most vital leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries particularly in Sub Saharan Africa (Bugssa and Tedla, 2020). About 95 % of all malaria cases and 96 % of all malaria deaths in 2021 occurred in Africa (Bugssa and Tedla, 2020). Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 60 % of global cases and 90 % of global fatalities (WHO, 2022). Over the two peak years of the pandemic (2020-2021), COVID-related setbacks increased malaria cases by around 13 million and fatalities by 63,000 (WHO, 2022). Malaria is thought to directly cost Africa $12 billion annually and reduce GDP growth by 3 %. In addition, it is thought to cause cognitive disorders and school absences, which are barriers to the development of human capital (Monroe et al., 2022). 95 % confidence interval (CI) and p-value of < 0.05. RESULT: The prevalence of malaria was 5 % (20, 95 % CI: 3-7), Plasmodium vivix account for 14 (61.9 %) of the infection. Presence of stagnant water (AOR = 3.630, 95 % CI: 1-13, P < 0.049), unavailability of Insecticide-treated bed net (AOR = 3.89, 95 % CI: 1.08-14.01, P < 0.038), living in a house with eaves (AOR = 5.06, 95 %CI: 1.25-20.58, p < 0.023), travel history (AOR = 3.58, 95 %CI: 1-12.79, p < 0.049), low-income (AOR = 5.3, 95 %CI: 1.09-25.2, P < 0.038), were significantly associated with malaria occurrence. CONCLUSION: Malaria is still a public health concern in Damboya town. Thus, implementing intervention strategies properly and evaluate the access and utilization status of the suburb community and improve accordingly was required to interrupt the transmission in the community of this town.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Aluminum phosphide is a cheap and commonly used rodenticide that is  also an effective solid fumigant and frequently used for grain preservation. The pill contains around 44% inert elements (ammonium carbonate) to avoid disintegration of the tablet, while the rest (about 56%) is aluminum phosphide. Because it is freely available on the market, it is one of the commonly used agents for self-poisoning in different parts of the developing world. Early signs of toxicity are manifested by shock and circulatory failure. Until now, no specific antidote is available. Aggressive supportive management is the key to survival in cases of aluminum phosphide poisoning. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of successful management of aluminum phosphide poisoning-induced cardiotoxicity with a favorable outcome in a 48-year-old Black African female patient who was taken to a private clinic 6 hours after intentional ingestion of two tablets of aluminum phosphide. She presented with repeated vomiting, restlessness, and confusion. Upon examination, the patient was drowsy, pale, cold, and clammy. She had nonrecordable blood pressure and radial pulsation. Glasgow Coma Scale was 14/15. Routine laboratory investigations and initial electrocardiogram were normal. Six hours after intensive care unit admission, the electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with fast ventricular response, ST segment elevation, and inverted T-waves. Cardiac troponin level was elevated. With the diagnosis of acute aluminum phosphide poisoning with cardiotoxicity (acute myocardial infarction), hospital-based protocol was administered and medical treatment for myocardial infarction was given. She was discharged on the fourth day after full recovery. She came for regular follow-up visits and had normal clinical evaluation, electrocardiogram, and laboratory findings. CONCLUSION: Exposure to phosphine gas released from aluminum phosphide fumigants increases the risk of major morbidity and mortality. The mortality due to aluminum phosphide poisoning is very high and variable. The use of magnesium sulfate to reduce cardiac arrhythmias and mortality is well documented, but there is no uniformity in dose or frequency of its administration worldwide. LIMITATIONS: One of the limitations of this report is the nature of the case report, being a retrospective design, giving no chance to establish a cause-effect relationship. Arterial blood gas analysis, serum magnesium level, and cardiac computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging modalities were not available in the town. The recommended gastric lavage with potassium permanganate solution was not used in this case, because potassium permanganate is not available in Ethiopia. The other limitation is that, as it is a case report from a single center, it may not be representative of the general population. These limitations might have a negative impact on the generalizability of the findings.

N2  - The resistance of foodborne pathogens to antimicrobial agents is a potential  danger to human health. Hence, establishing the status of good agricultural practices (GAPs) and the antimicrobial susceptibility of major foodborne pathogens has a significant programmatic implication in planning interventions. The objective of this study was to assess the gap in attaining GAP and estimate the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Salmonella in vegetable farms fertilized with animal manure in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total of 81 vegetable farms from four sub-cities in Addis Ababa were visited, and 1119 samples were collected: soil (n = 271), manure (n = 375), vegetables (n = 398), and dairy cattle feces (n = 75). Additional data were collected using a structured questionnaire. Isolation of Salmonella was done using standard microbiology techniques and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using disk diffusion assays. Carriage for antimicrobial resistance genes was tested using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among the 81 vegetable farms visited, 24.7% used animal manure without any treatment, 27.2% used properly stored animal manure and 80.2% were easily accessible to animals. The prevalence of Salmonella was 2.3% at the sample level, 17.3% at the vegetable farm level, and 2.5% in vegetables. The highest rate of resistance was recorded for streptomycin, 80.7% (21 of 26), followed by kanamycin, 65.4% (17 of 26), and gentamicin, 61.5% (16 of 26). Multidrug resistance was detected in 61.5% of the Salmonella isolates. Vegetable farms have a gap in attaining GAPs, which could contribute to increased contamination and the transfer of antimicrobial resistance to the vegetables. The application of GAPs, including proper preparation of compost and the appropriate use of antimicrobials in veterinary practices, are recommended to reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.

N2  - The blanket NP fertilizer recommendation over the past five decades in Ethiopia  did not result in a significant increment of crop productivity. The main lack of success was highly linked to the extrapolating approach of one site success to others without considering the climate, soil, and ecological setting and variations. As a result, a new fertilization approach was desperately needed, and with this premise, new blended fertilizers are now being introduced to replace the conventional approach. Thus, the objective of this study was to examine the effect of NPSZnB blended fertilizer on bread wheat yield attributes, quality traits and use efficiency in two different soil types under rain-fed conditions in Ayiba, northern Ethiopia. Relevant agronomic data were evaluated and recorded from plots of each soil types for analysis. The analysis of variance revealed a significant (p < 0.001) variation on all the agronomic and grain quality traits due to the main and interaction effects of soil type and fertilizer treatment factors. Most agronomic and quality characteristics recorded the highest result in the highest treatment applications (175 and 150 kg NPSZnB ha(-1)) in both soils. Yield and grain quality traits of bread wheat was also found better under fertilized plots than unfertilized plots. In both soil types increasing application of the new blended fertilizer rate from 50-175 kg NPSZnB ha(-1) showed an increasing trend in grain yield from 1.6 to 4.3 and 2.5 to 5.4 t ha(-1) in Vertisol and Cambisol soils, respectively. The varied yield as a response of fertilizer treatments across soils signifies soil-specific fertilization approach is critically important for production increment. On the other hand, based on the partial budget analysis the highest net benefit with the highest marginal rate of return in both Vertisol and Cambisol soils were obtained when treated with 100 and 125 kg NPSZnB ha(-1), respectively. Therefore, to produce optimum bread wheat yield under rainfed conditions in Ayiba (northern Ethiopia) fertilizing Vertisols with 100 kg NPSZnB ha(-1) and fertilizing Cambisols with 125 kg NPSZnB ha(-1) is recommended.

N2  - Acid soils are a major constraint to agricultural productivity in many parts of  sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. Restoring soil pH to optimal ranges for agriculture can have a significant impact on yields, particularly for acid intolerant crops like wheat and barley. The application of agricultural lime is the standard corrective, although the large application requirements, lack of farmer awareness, and weak or non-existent lime supply chains make this a complex problem to address at scale. To date, no large-scale farmer trials of lime application have been undertaken in Ethiopia. This leaves open the question to local policy makers as to the economic benefits given the enormous capital and logistics investments required. To help address this we leverage existing spatial edaphic data and longitudinal crop surveys to simulate the productivity impact of varying lime and fertilizer applications. Our estimates find the impact of moving pH from 5.5 to 6.5, modeled as a lime soil remediation strategy, increases yields by 22% and 19% for wheat and barley, respectively. In addition, at lower pH levels our models indicate that commonly used nitrogen-based fertilizers are less cost-effective. For wheat in highly acidic soils, we find that fertilizers cost over two times as much as a single application of lime over a five-year period. The cost savings of the use of lime reaches as high as 121% of average one-year agricultural household income for wheat; with barley these savings are lower but still substantial at 24%. In general, we advocate for an integrated soil fertility management strategy that applies appropriate levels of fertilizer on pH balanced soil. If successful, Ethiopia's acid soil reclamation could become a modest version of Brazil's successful "cerrado miracle" and serve as an example for Africa.

N2  - Breast cancer (BC) is becoming one of the most prevalent non-infectious disease  in low and middle income countries. The steady rise of BC incidence may be related to the different risk factors. Among many, rampant presence of environmental pollutants might be one of the risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate exposure to organochlorine pesticides as a risk factor to breast cancer. A case-control study design was employed among breast cancer patients and non-breast cancer individuals (controls). Blood samples were collected from 100 study participants (50 cases and 50 controls) followed by serum separation, extraction and cleanup using standard analytical procdures. The findings revealed that ten organochlorine pesticides were detected in the serum of the study participants. From the detected organochlorine pesticides, heptachlor was observed at higher concentration for breast cancer patients (6.90±4.37 μg/L) and controls (9.15±3.84 μg/L). Mean serum level of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, heptachlor, gamma-chlordane, endosulfan, and dibutyl-chlorendate were significantly higher in the serum of breast cancer patients than the controls. From the studied pesticides, p,p'-DDT and gamma-chlordane are significant predictors for BC, while, others are equivocal. A unit increment of the concentration of p,p'-DDT (AOR; 2.03, 95% CI: 1.041-3.969) increased the odds of developing breast cancer by two, while for gamma-chlordane (AOR;3.12, 95% CI; 1.186-8.203) by three. Our study results suggesting that, organochlorines are a risk factors for breast cancer in Ethiopia. Decreasing exposure to such organochlorines might have a significant public health relevance in reducing non-communicable chronic illnesses. Besides, continues monitoring of persistent organic pollutants using body biomarkers is important for disease prevention and device mitigation measures.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to study the association of different modern  contraceptive methods and anemia on women of childbearing age. METHODS: The study was conducted based on secondary data from Ethiopia demographic and health surveys (EDHS) in 2016. The study included 12,981, women of childbearing age. The dependent variable is anemia which was defined based on the level of hemoglobin concentration, and was classified as non-anemic (above 12 g/dL) or anemic (below 12 g/dL). The association between anemia with modern contraceptive method and BMI was analyzed using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 12,891 non-pregnant women were recruited for this study, 26.3% (95% CI: 25.9 to 27.1) had anemia, and hemoglobin level was 12.9 ± 1.7. The current use of modern contraceptives has substantially reduced the odds of anemia by 50% compared with non-users. Compared to barrier methods, individual modern contraceptive use showed higher odds ratio of, oral contraceptive pills (OCP) 0.6 (95% CI: 0.45 to 1.12), injectables 0.59 (95% CI: 0.24 to 1.79), implant 0.72 (95% CI: 0.60 to 0.86) and significantly reduces the risk of anemia. In addition to the contraceptive method, BMI found to improve anemia and the underweight women showed significant effect on an anemia (OR 2.20 (95% CI 1.58-2. 62)) P = 0.000. CONCLUSION: The use of hormonal contraceptive methods reduces anemia among women of childbearing age. Moreover, there is an association between BMI and anemia.

N2  - This simulation study was carried out to assess the impact of climate change and  adaptation strategies on maize production across 22 locations in Ethiopia using Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer - Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM) CERES-Maize. Three maize varieties, i.e., [BH-660 (late maturing), BH-540 (medium maturing) and Melkasa-1 (short maturing)] along with three planting dates [early (25-Apr), normal (25-May) and late (25-Jun)], four N fertilizer rates (64, 96, 128 and 160 kg N/ha) and three water levels [rainfed (no irrigation), two irrigations (each 30 mm at time of flowering and 5 d after flowering with total = 60 mm) and five irrigations (each 30 mm at time of flowering to early grain-filing, which were applied every five days in total = 150 mm)] were evaluated as the adaptation strategy. The mid-century (2040-2069) temperatures and solar radiation were extracted from multiple model means across the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) models under the highest Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5). Maize productivity was evaluated assuming that maize was grown on shallow sandy loam soils. Yield of an early, medium and late maturing maize were changed by -13 to -8%, -10 to +4% and + 3 to +13%, respectively, relative to the baseline period (1980-2005). The days to maturity decreased by about 16%. Under rainfed condition, N application up to 64, 128 and 160 kg/ha significantly improved yield for early, medium and late maturing varieties, respectively. Relatively high yield and low inter-seasonal yield variability were simulated for BH-660 and Melkasa-1 when planted on 25-Apr and 25-May, respectively, for most locations. Application of two (60 mm) and five (150 mm) irrigation levels improved yield in drier locations. In conclusion, this study provides potential adaptation options under the future climate in maize producing regions of Ethiopia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The combined application of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)  and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are commonly used malaria interventions that target indoor Anopheles vectors. Recent studies on the effects of house screening (HS) and LLINs have demonstrated a reduction in indoor vector densities and malaria when the interventions are combined. In addition, complementary interventions are needed to curb co-occurring pest populations which pose menace to agricultural crop productivity and food security. However, interventions that impact malaria mainly centre on public health strategies, overlooking subtle but important component of agricultural measures. Addressing the coexisting risks of malaria and crop pests could contribute to improved livelihood of communities. METHODS: A four-armed household, cluster-randomized, controlled study will be conducted to assess the combined impact of HS, LLINs and push-pull agricultural technology (PPT) against clinical malaria in children in Ethiopia. The unit of randomization will be the household, which includes a house and its occupants. A total of 838 households will be enrolled in this study. In this trial 246 households will receive LLINs and HS, 250 will receive LLINs, HS and PPT, 175 households will receive LLINs and PPT. The remaining 167 houses which receive LLINs only will be used as control. One child aged ≤14 years will be enrolled per household in each treatment and followed for clinical malaria using active case detection to estimate malaria incidence for two malaria transmission seasons. DISCUSSION: Episodes of clinical malaria, density of indoor biting malaria vectors, sporozoite infection rate, improved crop infestation rate, crop yield gain, livestock productivity and cost effectiveness analysis will be the end points of this study. Socio-economic, social demographic, cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted using qualitative and participatory methods to explore the acceptability of HS and PPT. Documenting the combined impact of LLINs, HS and PPT on the prevalence of clinical malaria and crop pest damage will be the first of its kind.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, maize is produced as major food crop that is based on  traditional methods of production, and there exists inefficiency in the use of available scarce resources. Thus, poor people are failing to achieve rapid economic growth, development, and food security still today in the country. Hence, the best possible means of achieving development is through increasing the production efficiency of farmers. Thus, to estimate the levels of production efficiency, this study specifically used only data of farmers who are producing without ploughing by oxen and without using fertilizers in the study area under shifting cultivation. METHOD: Stochastic frontier production is used to estimate the technical efficiency score, and the cost frontier model is used to estimate production efficiency. To determine the determinants of production efficiency, the Tobit model was used in this study. RESULT: The Tobit model results show that loss due to wild animals, experience of household, and off-farm income had a negative impact on production efficiency of farmers. Regarding the positive determinants of production efficiency, land conservation practice and mobile use have a positive influence. Conclusion and recommendation. The farmers in the study area are inefficient in the production of maize. Since the loss of maize products is high due to wild animals such as pigs, apes, and monkeys that results in production inefficiency, the agricultural policies and strategies of Ethiopian governments should be directed toward providing tourism to protect those wild animals. Additionally, to increase the production efficiency, construction of terraces and soil bunds to conserve land and supporting the farmers by providing network facilities for mobile usage that boost maize production efficiency of farmers is essential for policymakers.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The functional survival time of long-lasting insecticidal nets  (LLINs), which varies across different field contexts, is critical for the successful prevention of malaria transmission. However, there is limited data on LLIN durability in field settings in Ethiopia. METHODS: A three-year longitudinal study was conducted to monitor attrition, physical integrity, and bio-efficacy and residual chemical concentration of LLINs in four regions in Ethiopia. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines were used to determine sample size, measure physical integrity, and calculate attrition rates, and functional survival time. Yearly bio-efficacy testing was done on randomly selected LLINs. An excel tool developed by vector works project was used to calculate the median functional survival time of the LLINs. Predictors of functional survival were identified by fitting binary and multivariate cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 3,396 LLINs were included in the analysis. A total of 3,396 LLINs were included in the analysis. By the end of 36 months, the proportion of LLINs functionally surviving was 12.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.5, 15.6], the rates of attrition due to physical damage and repurposing were 48.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 45.0, 52.6] and 13.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 11.6, 14.6], respectively. The estimated median functional survival time was 19 months (95%CI 17, 21). Factors associated with shorter functional survival time include being in a low malaria transmission setting [Adjusted Hazards Ratio (AHR) (95%CI) 1.77 (1.22, 2.55)], rural locations [AHR (95%CI) 1.83 (1.17, 2.84)], and in a room where cooking occurs [AHR (95%CI) 1.28 (1.05, 1.55)]. Bioassay tests revealed that 95.3% (95%CI 86.4, 98.5) of the LLINs met the WHO criteria of bio-efficacy after 24 months of distribution. CONCLUSION: The LLIN survival time was shorter than the expected three years due to high attrition rates and rapid loss of physical integrity. National malaria programmes may consider, procuring more durable LLINs, educating communities on how to prevent damage of LLINs, and revising the current three-year LLIN distribution schedule to ensure sufficient protection is provided by LLINs against malaria transmission. While this paper contributes to the understanding of determinants impacting functional survival, further research is needed to understand factors for the rapid attrition rates and loss of physical integrity of LLINs in field settings.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Grasspea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is an important pulse crop for food,  feed and sustainable crop production systems in Ethiopia. Despite its advantages in nutrition and adaptability to harsh climate and low fertile soil, it contains a neurotoxin, β-N-oxalyl-α,β-diamiono propionic acid (β-ODAP), which paralyses the lower limbs and is affected by genotypic and agronomic factors. To determine the effect of zinc application and planting date on yield and β-ODAP content of two genotypes, experiments were conducted in two regions of Ethiopia. RESULTS: The main effects of variety, sowing date and zinc and their interactions were significant (P < 0.001) for β-ODAP and seed yield, which had a linear relationship with zinc. For the improved grasspea variety, an application of 20 kg ha(-1) zinc showed a reduction of β-ODAP from 0.15% to 0.088% at Debre Zeit and 0.14% to 0.08% at Sheno and increased its yield from 841 kg ha(-1) to 2260 kg ha(-1) at Debre Zeit and from 715 to 1835 kg ha(-1) at Sheno. Early sowing showed a reduction in ODAP content in relation to the late sowing. CONCLUSION: An application of Zn beyond even 20 kg ha(-1) with an early sowing is recommended for the improved variety. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.

N2  - Cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) holds significant agricultural and  nutritional importance in Ethiopia; yet, its production faces challenges, including suboptimal nitrogen fertilizer management. The aim of this review was to review the possible effect of nitrogen fertilizer levels on the production of cabbage in Ethiopia. Nitrogen fertilization significantly influences cabbage yield and quality. Moderate to high levels of nitrogen application enhance plant growth, leaf area, head weight, and yield. However, excessive nitrogen levels can lead to adverse effects such as delayed maturity, increased susceptibility to pests and diseases, and reduced postharvest quality. In Ethiopia, small-scale farmers use different nitrogen levels for cabbage cultivation. In Ethiopia, NPSB or NPSBZN fertilizers are widely employed for the growing of various crops such as cabbage. 242 kg of NPS and 79 kg of urea are the blanket recommendation for the current production of cabbage in Ethiopia. The existing rate is not conducive for farmers. Therefore, small-scale farmers ought to utilize an optimal and cost-effective nitrogen rate to boost the cabbage yield. Furthermore, the effectiveness of nitrogen fertilization is influenced by various factors including the soil type, climate, cabbage variety, and agronomic practices. Integrated nutrient management approaches, combining nitrogen fertilizers with organic amendments or other nutrients, have shown promise in optimizing cabbage production while minimizing environmental impacts. The government ought to heed suggestions concerning soil characteristics such as the soil type, fertility, and additional factors such as the soil pH level and soil moisture contents.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying has been a key national malaria prevention  and control strategy in Ethiopia. However, there is a gap in monitoring and evaluation of house-wall modification after indoor residual spraying before the end of residual lifespan. This study has determined the prevalence of house-wall modification after indoor residual spraying and identified the associated factors in Shashogo district, southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2022. Data were collected from 640 randomly selected households using a pre-tested questionnaire and an observational checklist. The binary logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with house-wall modification after indoor residual spraying before the end of the potency period. RESULTS: The prevalence of house-wall modification after indoor residual spraying was found to be 30.4% (95% CI 27.4-34.2%). Educational status of could not read and write [AOR = 1.76, 95% CI (1.16, 2.68)], monthly income of more than birr 3000 [AOR = 3.27, 95% CI (1.78, 6.01)], low level of knowledge about indoor residual spraying [AOR = 3.81, 95% CI (2.39, 6.06)], lack of information within two weeks before spraying [AOR = 2.23, 95% CI (1.44, 3.46)], absence of supervision after spraying [AOR = 1.79, 95% CI (1.14, 2.81)], absence of stagnant water near house [AOR = 3.36, 95% CI (2.13, 5.39)], and thatched roof [AOR = 1.82, 95% CI (1.04, 3.16)] were factors significantly associated with house-wall modification after indoor residual spraying. CONCLUSION: This study has revealed that the prevalence of house-wall modification after indoor residual spraying before the end of the residual lifespan in the study area was higher compared to other studies in developing countries. Therefore, special emphasis should be given to providing community education about indoor residual spraying, conducting regular supervision before and after residual spraying, enforcing some legislative strategies for modifying the house-wall before six months after spraying, and improving environmental and housing conditions.

N2  - To gain a comprehensive understanding of the potential environmental and public  health implications of current fecal sludge (FS) handling practices in developing countries, investigating its composition is crucial. This study addresses quantitatively the variability of common water and wastewater parameters, parasite eggs and pollutants of concern, such as heavy metals, across different FS handling technologies. Additionally, it presents a qualitative screening of other micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, hormones and pesticides, along with an assessment of resource recovery potential. Based on sanitation records provided by the local government, FS dislodging practices were categorized into six types (septic tanks and pits for institutions, septic tanks and pits for private houses and septic tank and pit for communal latrines). The quality of FS across these dislodging types was evaluated using 31 FS samples directly obtained from FS dislodging trucks in Ethiopia. The study found that the average moisture content of the sludge was 98.7 %, with a calorific value of 16 MJ/kg of total solids (TS), indicating its potential for water and energy recovery. Furthermore, the study revealed a prevalence ranking of Ascaris lumbricoides egg > Taenia egg > Hookworm egg> Hymenolepis nana egg> Enterobius vermicularis egg> Trichuris trichiura egg, with a mean value of 689 eggs/L of fecal sludge and a 100 % prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides eggs. Additionally, 14 heavy metals with mean concentrations ranging between 0.002 and 6.25 mg/L were identified. For most of these metals, the concentration was significantly positively correlated with the TS content. Moreover, in this study 32 drugs and their derivatives, 6 hormones, and 1 insecticide have been detected. Overall, the compositional profile of the FS in this study indicates that improper handling of the sludge may pose potential public health and environmental threats. However, it also highlights the valuable potential of water and energy recovery from FS.

N2  - The study evaluated the efficacy of neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) and  Chinaberry (Melia azedarach L.) seed oils as repellents against laboratory and field populations of some sandflies in Ethiopia. In the laboratory, concentrations of 2% and 5% neem oil in coconut oil tested against Phlebotomus orientalis (vector of visceral leishmaniasis) provided 96.28% (95% CI=95.60-96.97) protection up to a mean time of 7h and 20 min and 98.26% (95% CI=93.46-104. 07) protection up to 9h, respectively. Similarly, M. azedarach oil at 2% concentration produced 95.13% (95% CI=90.74-99.52) protection for the same duration (7h and 20 min), while the 5% oil gave 96.20 (95% CI=86.98-105.41) protection for 8h and 20 min against the same species with no significant difference in percentage protection between the two oils at 2% and 5% concentrations. In the field tests with only neem oil (A. indica) against field populations of P. orientalis and P. bergeroti, similar high level of repellencies were recorded with about the same duration of protection. Application of both neem and Chinaberry oils can be safe and low-cost means of personal protection against sandfly bites in endemic areas of Ethiopia, if the community is advised and encouraged to grow the plants abundantly.

N2  - Information on bionomics of Anopheles species composition, seasonal dynamics and  insecticide susceptibility status is important to understand malaria transmission in any particular eco-epidemiological setting and for the design of effective vector control strategies. Here, adult mosquitoes were collected using CDC light traps (CDC LTs) and human landing catches (HLC) for 17 months between June 2018 and September 2020 from Lare District of Ethiopia. Larvae and pupae of anopheline mosquitoes were collected from breeding sites of Lare District and Jimma and reared to adulthood. Bioassays were conducted on non-blood-fed, 3-5-day-old emerged adult female mosquitoes using WHO insecticide-impregnated papers. Plasmodium spp. infection in Anopheles pharoensis and An. coustani were identified using TaqMan qPCR. Of 11,048 Anopheles mosquitoes collected, An. coustani was the most common (46.20%, n = 5103), followed by An. pharoensis (27.89%, n = 3082), An. gambiae (s.l.) (16.04%, n = 1772) and An. funestus (9.88%, n = 1091). Most of the mosquitoes (73.17%, n = 8084) were collected using CDC LTs and 26.83% (n = 2964) were captured using HLC. The mean density of An. gambiae, An. pharoensis and An. coustani was generally higher in June-November as compared to other months during the study period. However, the mean density of An. funestus was relatively higher through November-January following the peak malaria period in Lare. Anopheles pharoensis, An. gambiae (s.l.) and An. coustani complex were susceptible to pirimiphos-methyl, propoxur and bendiocarb. However, An. pharoensis and An. gambiae (s.l.) were resistant to DDT, deltamethrin, permethrin and malathion, whilst members of the An. coustani complex were resistant to DDT and deltamethrin. No Plasmodium spp. infection was detected from samples of Anopheles coustani and An. pharoensis. There was temporal variation in mean density of Anopheles mosquitoes and higher mean mosquito density was recorded during June-November (except for An. funestus). The higher outdoor mean mosquito density coupled with multiple insecticide resistance of malaria vector populations and occurrence of An. funestus in the dry season call for regular monitoring and intervention considering the behavioural dynamics of Anopheles species across seasons.

N2  - Pollution the water by harmful chemicals can leads to entry of pollutants into food chain. Water bodies play a major role in assimilating or carrying of industrial and municipal waste water, runoff from agricultural fields, roadways and street which are responsible for water pollution. In the present study influenced the amount of carbamate Pesticide Pyraclostrobin (20%) on freshwater fish Ctenopharyngodon idella. The fish were acclimatized to laboratory conditions for 7-10 days and then exposed to different lethal concentrations of pyraclostrobin (24, 48,72,96hrs of 7.2, 6.8, 6.4, 6.0mg/L) for 96hr along with the controls. Water parameters were also before down the experiment. The 96hr LC50 Ctenopharyngodon idella exposed of pyraclostrobin found in 6.0mg/Lt. The LC50 values were calculated in Finney Probit method. lower bond (5.6074) and the upper bond was in (6.3926). The Pyraclostrobin effect on fish showed uncontrolled behaviour like mucus secretion, decreased agility and inability to maintain normal position and erradic swimming were seen in exposure time of the carbamate toxicant. The fish were exposed to lethal and sublethal concentrations for 24hr, 4th and 8th days. After each exposure period, different tissues were taken to estimate the total protein levels. www.ijcrt.org © 2021 IJCRT | Volume 9, Issue 1 January 2021 | ISSN: 2320-2882 IJCRT2101364 International Journal of Creative Research Thoughts (IJCRT) www.ijcrt.org 2969 Introduction :Modernization and intensification of agricultural production is generally accompanied by a rapid increase in the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Pesticides are useful tools in agriculture, but the gradual degrading of aquatic ecosystem. In addition to agriculture practices together with pest control programmes the surface runoff and aerial spraying forming the major source for translocation pesticides into aquatic ecosystems (Joseph et al., 2011). The improper management of pesticides in agriculture crops could result in contamination of water bodies (Candida Toni et al., 2011; Capkin and Altinok, 2013). When pesticide reaches the aquatic environment, it may be present there for several days or weeks, depending upon its solubility, producing of mass mortality, morphological, physiological and behavioral changes in the organisms. Studies reveal that fluoride accumulates in bones and flesh of fish (2018). Studies suggest that dietary fishes are one of the major contributors in dental fluorosis in human beings(2016). h increasing concentration of fluoride ion in water, severity of effect of fluorite toxicity on fishes and other aquatic organisms increase. . It has been reported that butachlor is moderately toxic and irritating for R. rutilus caspicus and S. lucioperca (Mohammad & Hedayati,2017). At present increased food production to meet the energy requirements of the ever-increasing population, is a major problem of our country. To meet these requirements man has employed modern techniques both in agricultural and industrial production. But at the same time the population explosion possesses a great threat to human society. Ali S, et al.,2016). Studies reveal that fluoride accumulates in bones2 and flesh of fish3 significant source of fluoride. (Chowdhury C et al.,2018). Studies suggest that dietary fishes are one of the major contributors in dental fluorosis in human beings S, Yousuf A, Nagaraj A, et al., 2015) . With increasing concentration of fluoride ion in water, severity of effect of fluorite toxicity on fishes and other aquatic organisms increase. Tirumala Rao B, et al., (2017). Contamination in water is through pesticides and industrial effluents1 . Fluoride toxicity effects aquatic life adversely. Whereas, concentration of chloride and calcium ions decreases the severity of fluoride toxicity in fishes . Our studies on effects of fluoride exposure on Channa punctatus reveals that fluoride induces oxidative stress and causes significant toxic effect on fish liver.(Ghosh S, et al.,2018). Labeo rohita showed a decrease in total protein content in liver muscle, gill and kidney upon sublethal exposure to fluoride, Kale MD, Muley DV,2015). Material and methods: -. Experimental profile: Healthy freshwater fish, Ctenopharyngodon idella size [6±7 cm total length (TL) and 6.5±7.5 g body weight] were collected from the fish farm, Kuchipudi, Guntur District of A.P, India. Then the fish was acclimatized to the laboratory conditions with sufficient dechlorinated water for 4 to 15 days at room temperature 28±20C. The fish were fed with meal fish, rice and commercial fish pellets once in two days, at the same time water was renewed every day rich in oxygen (aeration) and feeding was stopped one day prior to the experimentation. The test compound for the study belonged to Carbamate pesticide Pyraclostrobin (20%WG) widely used in agriculture field. Pyraclostrobin is a broad-spectrum pesticide used to control insects, pest, and mites in agricultural field. Concentration of Pyraclostrobin was found in 96hr 6.0 mg/lt as a lethal and 1/10th was taken as a sublethal concentration along with control www.ijcrt.org © 2021 IJCRT | Volume 9, Issue 1 January 2021 | ISSN: 2320-2882 IJCRT2101364 International Journal of Creative Research Thoughts (IJCRT) www.ijcrt.org 2970 group was maintained for each experiment. Where maximum 10 fish were used per each concentration of the test toxicant, 10 fish were also maintained in separate container along with experimental group, served as control. EFFECTS OF PYRACLOSTROBIN TOXICITY ON FISH HEALTH The pesticide pollution is one of the major pollutions in aquatic field which effect the aquatic animals. The carbamate Pyraclostrobin (20% WG) pesticide exposed for 96hr the value was found in 6.0 mg/l and the sublethal was taken where as in 1/10th of the lethal. The 96hr LC50 values with 95% confidence limits for Pyraclostrobin upper bond (1.4497) and the lower bond (1.3503) was shown in Table.5. Allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, is a member of the family Alliaceae. (2015). History of dietary and medicinal applications for curing various diseases. (2014). The use of garlic in aquaculture has been reported to promote growth, stimulate appetite, provide a tonic to improve the immune system, provide antistress protection and can be a proven prophylactic and therapeutic agent. (2015). The percent mortality of the freshwater fish Labeo rohita in different concentrations was shown in table. the probit mortality of the fish in different concentrations along with log concentration was shown in table , under the toxicity evaluation. Decreased swimming behaviour and increased respiration rate were other effects of pesticide in the present study, found that contaminates such as pesticides disturb normal fish behaviours after exposure. The physiological and biochemical alterations observed in an animal under any physiological stress can be correlated with the structural and functional changes of cellular proteins. Among the non-essential metals, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, lead and silver, poses serious threat. (Vanitha, A., et al., 2017). The investigations on pretilachlor have focused on removal of pretilachlor from the environment and the effect of pretilachlor on soil microorganisms (Saha et al., 2012; Toan et al., 2013). reported that the toxicity of pretilachlor on Gambusia increases with increasing concentration and exposure time. (Ali,S. Mohamd, R.I.,2013).

N2  - Occupational pesticide exposure is one of the most important occupational risks among farmers and farm workers in Africa. In Ethiopia agriculture contributes 47% of the total Gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 80% of the work force. The main objective of this study was to assess pesticide related knowledge, occupational pesticide exposure and adverse health effects due to pesticide exposure in different commercial farming systems including newly developing farming systems in Ethiopia. The study was conducted in the Central Eastern part of Ethiopia by including occupationally exposed farmers and farm workers selected from large-scale greenhouses (LSGH), large-scale open farms (LSOF) and small-scale irrigated farms (SSIF). Also occupationally unexposed study subjects were selected from small scale subsistence farm areas and office farm workers. The study consisted of two cross-sectional surveys in 2012 and 2014 which were conducted sequentially in the same study area and farming systems. Pesticide related knowledge, attitude, practices (KAP) study indicated an increase (6-13 fold) in pesticide use intensity from previous estimates, use of DDT on food crops, poor attainment of pesticide related trainings, limited use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and hazardous empty pesticide container management. To assess the exposure of individuals participating in the two surveys we developed semi-quantitative occupational pesticide assessment algorithms (i.e. one for applicators and another for re-entry workers). The algorithms were used in our studies on acute as well as chronic health effects of pesticides. A survey on neurobehavioral symptoms and acute pesticide poisoning (APP) in pesticide applicators indicated a16.0% prevalence of APP. This study also indicated a decrease of APP risk with years of employment and an association of both cumulative pesticide exposure and past APP with neurobehavioral symptoms. Two consecutive cross-sectional surveys performed on respiratory health indicated exposure-response associations of chronic cough and shortness of breath with estimated pesticide exposures. The lung function measurements of the second survey indicated a reduction in FEF 25-75 %, FEV1 and risk of FEV1/FVC ratio< 0.8 with increasing pesticide exposure. The observed effects of exposure to pesticides on respiratory function of Ethiopian farmers and farm workers are clinically significant with a predicted decrease of 41.1 ml and 127.6 ml/s in FEV1 and FEF 25-75 % per year of exposure to pesticides, respectively. Results from the secondary sex ratio (SSR) study indicated diversions from Ethiopian expected values in opposite direction for paternal (applicators) exposure to pesticides (relatively more boys) compared to maternal (re-entry work) exposure to pesticides (relatively more girls). After controlling for potential confounders being an applicator showed a border line significant increase of SSR (+0.113 SE 0.067). Interestingly, life style factors as alcohol and Khat consumption showed significant but opposite associations with SSR in male applicators. This study is the most comprehensive epidemiological study to date that was carried out on occupational pesticide risks and health effects among Ethiopian farmers and farm workers. The study showed a stark increase in pesticide use, poor pesticide related knowledge and increased respiratory, neurological and reproductive health effects among exposed farmers and farmworkers. Farmers’ and farm workers’ occupational health and safety must be guaranteed and should not be compromised at any cost in Ethiopian agriculture.

T1  - Essays on the Economics of Sustainable Agricultural Technologies in Ethiopia

N2  - s This thesis consists of five self-contained papers: Paper 1: Adoption of multiple sustainable agricultural practices in rural Ethiopia The adoption and diffusion of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) have become an important issue in the development-policy agenda for Sub-Saharan Africa, especially as a way to tackle land degradation, low agricultural productivity, and poverty. However, the adoption rates of SAPs remain below expected levels. This paper analyzes the factors that facilitate or impede the probability and level of adoption of interrelated SAPs, using recent data from multiple plot-level observations in rural Ethiopia. Multivariate and ordered probit models are applied to the modeling of adoption decisions by farm households facing multiple SAPs which can be adopted in various combinations. The results show that there is a significant correlation between SAPs, suggesting that adoptions of SAPs are interrelated. The analysis further shows that both the probability and the extent of adoption of SAPs are influenced by many factors: a household’s trust in government support, credit constraints, spouse education, rainfall and plot-level disturbances, household wealth, social capital and networks, labor availability, plot and market access. These results imply that policy makers and development practitioners should seek to strengthen local institutions and service providers, maintain or increase household asset bases, and establish and strengthen social protection schemes, to improve the adoption of SAPs. Paper 2: Cropping systems diversification, conservation tillage and modern seed adoption in Ethiopia: Impacts on household income, agrochemical use and demand for labor The type and combination of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) adopted has a significant effect on agricultural productivity and food security. Previous studies on adoption and impact have focused on single practices. However, in reality several adoption decisions are made simultaneously. We developed a multinomial endogenous switching regression model of farmers’ choice of combination of SAPs and impacts on maize income and use of agrochemicals and family labor use in rural Ethiopia and found four primary results. First, adoption of SAPs increases maize income and the highest payoff is achieved when SAPs are adopted in combination rather than in isolation. Second, nitrogen fertilizer use is lower in the package that contains systems diversification and conservation tillage. Third, conservation tillage increased pesticide application and labor demand, perhaps to compensate for reduced tillage. However, when it is used jointly with systems diversification practices such as legume rotations it does not have a significant impact on pesticide and labor use. Fourth, since women contribute much of the farm labor needed for staple crops, adoption of packages increases their workload, in most cases, suggesting that agricultural intensification technology interventions may not be gender neutral. This implies that policy makers and other stakeholders promoting a combination of technologies can enhance household food security through increasing income and reducing production costs, but need to be aware of the potential gender related outcomes. Paper 3: The impact of shadow prices and farmers’ impatience on the allocation of a multipurpose renewable resource in Ethiopia In a mixed farming system in which farmyard manure (FYM) is considered an important multipurpose renewable resource that can be used to enhance soil organic matter, provide additional income, and supply household energy, soil fertility depletion could take place within the perspective of the allocation pattern of FYM. This paper estimates a system of FYM allocation regressions to examine the role of returns to FYM and farmers’ impatience on the propensity to allocate FYM to different uses. We parameterize the model using data from a sample of 493 households in Ethiopia. Results indicate a heightened incentive for diverting FYM from farming to marketing for burning outside the household when returns to selling FYM and the farmer’s discount rate are high. These reveal the need for policies that will help to reduce farmers’ impatience and encourage the substitution of alternative energy sources to use FYM as a sustainable land management practice. Paper 4: Jointness in agricultural production and livestock technology adoption in Ethiopia Even though farmyard manure is considered a promising soil fertilizer in many developing countries, its use in soil fertility restoration is constrained by a multitude of factors. Yet the adoption of a crop-livestock technology could relax these constraints. This paper examines the impact of a joint crop-livestock technology on farmyard manure production and the effect of farmers’ risk preference on livestock technology adoption. An endogenous switching regression model is employed to account for self-selection in technology adoption. The model is implemented using survey data from 491 households collected in the central highlands of Ethiopia. The results show that farmers’ risk preference, distance to the extension service center, and market access to complementary inputs significantly influence the adoption of improved livestock technology. Adoption of crossbreeding technology creates a positive and significant impact on organic fertilizer production. The positive indirect effect of crop technology is significantly higher for those who adopt livestock technology. This implies that a policy supporting crop-livestock synergies through joint provision of technologies is important in order to increase agricultural productivity through better soil fertility management. Paper 5: Risk preferences as determinants of soil conservation decisions in Ethiopia Soil degradation is one of the most serious environmental problems in the highlands of Ethiopia. The prevalence of traditional agricultural land use and the absence of appropriate resource management often result in the degradation of natural soil fertility. This has important implications for soil productivity, household food security, and poverty. Given the extreme vulnerability of farmers in this area, we hypothesized that farmers’ risk preferences might affect the sustainability of resource use. This study presents experimental results on the willingness of farmers to take risks and relates the subjective risk preferences to actual soil conservation decisions. The study looks at a random sample of 143 households with 597 farming plots. We find that a high degree of risk aversion significantly decreases the probability of adopting soil conservation. This implies that reducing farmers’ risk exposure could promote soil conservation practices and thus more sustainable natural resource management. This might be achieved by improving tenure security, promoting access to extension services and education, and developing income-generating off-farm activities.

N2  - In Africa, environmental and occupational health risks are mostly underreported. We initiated the BIONET EU project with the aim of understanding the occupational origin of certain diseases that seem to be associated with new occupational settings, while developing and implementing a sentinel surveillance system, comprising training and guidance of occupational physicians (OC), who will report new work-related diseases in African countries. A group of 30 OC is recruited and trained in each of the partner countries (Morocco, Benin, and Ethiopia). Each committed OC is asked to recruit 50 workers during a consultation in a time frame of 6 months (1500 workers per country). Workers are asked to fill out an online questionnaire about their health status and work conditions, including exposure to 20 chemicals. Urine and blood samples are then collected for human biomonitoring of common exposures. Our preliminary results showed that 92% of the employees surveyed are exposed to physical constraints, 44% to chemical agents, and 24% to biological agents. The most common physical constraints are manual handling of loads, noise pollution, and thermal pollution. The most frequent chemical risks are exposure to pesticides and fuels. The BIONET project will allow a better understanding of effective sentinel systems as a promising method to gather high-quality data, which can support policy-making in terms of assessing occupational exposure, preventing emerging work-related diseases, and ensuring feedback to assist with prevention in African countries.

N2  - Root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid and White) Chit wood) is one of the major constraints for the successful cultivation of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) in Ethiopia. Among different management strategies, biological control is important in the light of increased awareness of environmental and human health hazards. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different locally available botanicals and an antagonistic fungus, Trichoderma harzianum to control root-knot nematode attacking tomato under in vitro condition. Leaf and seed extracts of four botanicals viz., Rape seed (Brassica napus L.), Lantana (Lantana camara L.), African marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) and Neem (Azadirachta indica L.) at two different concentrations (5 ml and 10 ml) and Trichoderma harzianum (5 ml) were tested. Plant extracts were more effective and significantly inhibited egg hatching and immobilizing the J2 larval mortality of M. incognita than T. harzianum. Aqueous extracts of all the botanicals inhibited egg hatching of nematode and resulted in 84.67 - 100 % mortality of the second juveniles of M. incognita at the 10% concentration after 72 h of exposure time. Leaf extracts of T. erecta and A. indica exhibited 100% inhibition of egg hatch and larva mortality, while at similar concentration of B. napus and L. camara leaf extracts exhibited 92 and 93.2% inhibition of egg hatch and 62.1 and 73% larval mortality, respectively. Egg inhibition and larval mortality decreased with increase in the dilution (10 ml) of extracts. Juvenile mortality increased corresponding to an increased time of exposure. Aqueous seed extracts of A. indica more significantly inhibited egg hatching and larva mortality of the J2 of M. incognita at 10% concentration and immobilized by 89, 93 and 100% after 24, 48 and 72 h of exposures, respectively, This study revealed that the test plants are readily available to farmers at no cost and able to reduce nematode population below economic threshold. There is a need for further studies in identifying new classes of bio-pesticides from natural plants to replace the synthetic chemicals used at present. Key words: Botanical leaf extracts, egg hatching, larval mortality, root-knot nematode, Trichoderma harzianum.

N2  - Breast cancer (BC) is becoming one of the most prevalent non-infectious disease in low and middle income countries. The steady rise of BC incidence may be related to the different risk factors. Among many, rampant presence of environmental pollutants might be one of the risk factors. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate exposure to organochlorine pesticides as a risk factor to breast cancer. A case-control study design was employed among breast cancer patients and non-breast cancer individuals (controls). Blood samples were collected from 100 study participants (50 cases and 50 controls) followed by serum separation, extraction and cleanup using standard analytical procdures. The findings revealed that ten organochlorine pesticides were detected in the serum of the study participants. From the detected organochlorine pesticides, heptachlor was observed at higher concentration for breast cancer patients (6.90±4.37 μg/L) and controls (9.15±3.84 μg/L). Mean serum level of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, heptachlor, gamma-chlordane, endosulfan, and dibutyl-chlorendate were significantly higher in the serum of breast cancer patients than the controls. From the studied pesticides, p,p'-DDT and gamma-chlordane are significant predictors for BC, while, others are equivocal. A unit increment of the concentration of p,p'-DDT (AOR; 2.03, 95% CI: 1.041-3.969) increased the odds of developing breast cancer by two, while for gamma-chlordane (AOR;3.12, 95% CI; 1.186-8.203) by three. Our study results suggesting that, organochlorines are a risk factors for breast cancer in Ethiopia. Decreasing exposure to such organochlorines might have a significant public health relevance in reducing non-communicable chronic illnesses. Besides, continues monitoring of persistent organic pollutants using body biomarkers is important for disease prevention and device mitigation measures.

N2  - Malaria is a severe public health problem in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. A retrospective study was conducted to model and interpret the effects of climate variability and environmental factors on the monthly malaria surveillance data of 152 districts in the region. The data were analyzed using the Bayesian generalized Poisson spatiotemporal model. Malaria incidence had significant seasonal, temporal, and spatial variations in the region. The risk of malaria incidence was decreased by 24% per 100 m increase in altitude. Monthly minimum temperature decreases the risk of malaria by 2.2% per a 1°C increment. The risk of malaria transmission was increased by 8% per 100 mm rise in the total monthly rainfall of districts. Besides, long-lasting insecticidal net coverage significantly reduces malaria risk by a factor of 0.8955. The finding suggests that malaria transmission was higher in northern and western districts. Hence, concerned bodies should consider seasonal, temporal, and spatial variations and effects of climate and environmental factors for intervention and elimination.

N2  - In Ethiopia, Fusarium ear rot (FER) reduces yield, quality, and safety of maize and negatively impacts the economics of maize growers. However, there is almost no published information on geographic distribution, severity, or causal agents of FER in Ethiopia or levels of preharvest fumonisin contamination, biophysical factors, and agronomic practices associated with FER. Therefore, we surveyed 480 agricultural fields located in 10 Ethiopian zones to assess the incidence and severity of FER as well as agricultural practices and biophysical factors associated with each field. We also determined the concentration of fumonisin in samples taken from the fields. Results revealed that FER was prevalent with varied disease intensity and yield loss levels among the assessed zones. The highest percent severity index (PSI) was recorded in Mirab Wellega (33.2%), with a correspondingly maximum estimated mean grain yield loss of 13.6%, while the minimum disease severity 11.3% and yield loss 5.4% were recorded from the Ilubabor zone. Fumonisins (FB1, FB2, FB3, and FB4) were detected in 98% of the samples, and the levels ranged from 5 to 7517 μg kg−1 (mean, 540 μg kg−1 and median 82.4 μg kg−1). The mean fumonisin contamination of 1524.4, 1316.8, 744.5, and 742.6 μg kg−1 was recorded for Mirab Welega, Misraq Wellega, Assosa, and Hawassa zones, respectively. In total, about 11.3% of the maize samples exceeded the maximum tolerable total fumonisin limit set by the European Union in maize flour (>1000 μg kg−1) and are not suitable for human consumption. Disease severity highly significantly (p < 0.0001) correlated with biophysical factors such as insect infestation (r = 0.60, p < 0.0001) and weed infestation (r = 0.64, p < 0.0001) and agronomic practices such as nitrogen phosphorus sulfur fertilizer application rate (r = −0.39, p < 0.0001) and insecticide spray frequency (r = −0.55, p < 0.0001). Other agronomic practices such as earlier or later sowing date and inter-cropping systems significantly reduced (p < 0.001) FER incidence, PSI, and the associated grain yield loss. There was significant (p < 0.0001) variation among maize cultivars currently under production in reaction against FER disease intensity. Moreover, the result of the present study attests a strong positive association (p < 0.001) between disease intensity and maize fumonisin concentrations. Generally, the study revealed a wider distribution of FER and fumonisin contamination of maize in the southwest major maize-growing belts of Ethiopia. Thus, appropriate integrated pre-harvest ear rot management strategies including the use of resistant cultivars and suitable agronomic practices are recommended for the management of FER and the associated mycotoxins in Ethiopia. © 2023 The Authors.

N2  - Chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L.) are a nutritious legume crop farmed on 17.8 million hectares in 56 countries throughout the world, with an estimated yearly yield of 14.78 million tones. Ethiopia is the leader in chickpea production on the African continent and the sixth-largest producer globally. However, Ascochyta rabiei remains a serious disease of chickpeas. If Ascochyta rabies is not managed, its effects on chickpea output could be either partial or complete under favourable environmental conditions. Knowing the severity level of this disease in farmlands where chickpeas are grown has an impact on the rates of yield and quality losses. Currently, Ethiopian farmers and pathologists in the field use traditional procedures to figure out the severity of Ascochyta blight, lead to invalid fungicide treatment. In this work, we created customized version of VGGNet model to identify the Ascochyta blight’s severity level. For noise reduction, we combined the Gaussian and Adaptive Median Filters; for optimization, we employed the Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA). The model categorizes the chickpea images into five groups according to the severity of the disease: Asymptomatic, Resistant, Moderately Resistant, Susceptible, and Highly Susceptible. The study’s findings indicate that the customized VGGNet outperformed the other models, achieving an accuracy of 96%. © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains to be the major cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women and children in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to investigate the local perceptions, practices and treatment seeking behaviour for malaria among women with children under the age of five years. METHODS: This community-based study was conducted in 2003 in an area of seasonal malaria transmission in Adami Tulu District, south-central Ethiopia. Total samples of 2087 rural women with children less than five years of age from 18 rural kebeles (the smallest administrative units) were interviewed about their perceptions and practices regarding malaria. In addition, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted on similar issues to complement the quantitative data. RESULTS: Malaria, locally known as busaa, is perceived as the main health problem in the study area. Mosquitoes are perceived to be the main cause of the disease, and other misperceptions were also widespread. The use of prevention measures was very low. Most mothers were familiar with the main signs and symptoms of mild malaria, and some of them indicated high grade fever, convulsions and mental confusion as a manifestation of severe malaria. Very few households (5.6%) possessed one or two nets. More than 60% of the mothers with recent episodes of malaria received initial treatment from non-public health facilities such as community health workers (CHWs) (40%) and private care providers (21%). Less than 40% of the reported malaria cases among women were treated by public health facilities. CONCLUSION: Malaria was perceived as the main health problem among women and children. The use of malaria preventive measures was low. A significant proportion of the respondents received initial malaria treatments from CHWs, private care providers and public health facilities. Concerted effort is needed to scale-up the distribution of insecticide-treated nets and improve the knowledge of the community about the link between malaria and mosquitoes. Effective antimalarial drugs should also be available at the grassroots level where the problem of malaria is rampant.

N2  - Background: In Ethiopia, pesticides are widely used in vegetable production. However, if used incorrectly they may harm consumers of vegetables contaminated with pesticide residues, as well as producers handling the pesticides and lead to ecological damage. We performed a cross-sectional survey to assess pesticide residues in vegetables produced in central and eastern Ethiopia. Methods: A total of 232 vegetable samples (91 tomatoes, 106 cabbages and 35 Swiss chard) were collected from fields and retail markets, and were screened for 35 pesticides (16 organochlorine, 11 organophosphate, 3 pyrethroids, 2 carbamates and 3 other agrochemicals) using GC–MS analysis. Results: Pesticides residues were detected in 60% of Swiss chard, 47% of cabbage and 45% of tomato samples. Two or more pesticides were detected in 20% of cabbages, 13% of tomatoes and over half of Swiss chard samples. Bendiocarb, diazinon, endrin, piperonyl butoxide, profenofos and propargite were detected, but only diazinon, propargite and profenofos had residual values above EU Maximum Residue Level (MRL), with diazinon commonly detected at relatively high levels. About 15% of the total analyzed samples, 10% of cabbages and tomatoes, and nearly half of Swiss chard samples had pesticide concentration exceeding EU MRL. However, none of the tested samples had residues exceeding Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) MRLs. Conclusion: This study showed widespread contamination of vegetables with pesticides, mainly organophosphates. We recommend monitoring and regulation of pesticides usage, with promotion of good agricultural practices.

N2  - Background: Bacterial wilt incited by Ralstonia solanacearum is the most important disease affecting ginger production in southwestern Ethiopia. The unavailability of disease-free planting materials, resistant cultivars, and effective chemical compounds are the key constraints in managing the disease. Objective: The study was initiated to determine the effect of integrated management methods on bacterial wilt disease and yield loss of ginger through combining hot water, bio-fumigation, soil-solarization and chemical pesticides. Methods: A total of seven treatment combinations comprising hot water, bio-fumigation, soil-solarization, Mancozeb, and bleaching powder were tested in a randomized complete block design in three replications. Data on disease incidence, growth, yield, and yield components were recorded from randomly selected plants. Results: The use of Mancozeb for seed socking and soil drenching combined with bio-fumigation and soil-solarization reduced the incidence of bacterial wilt by 63.3% and enhanced the rhizome yield by 66.8%. Rhizome and soil treatment using bleaching powder along with soil bio-fumigation also reduced the disease incidence by 38.9% and increased ginger yield by 61.5%. It also provided the highest (6678.7%) marginal rate of return of any treatment combination tested in the experiment. Disease incidence was highly significantly and inversely (r=-0.98**) correlated with rhizome yield. The regression slope estimated that 83.4% of ginger yield loss was associated with bacterial wilt disease. Conclusion: A combined application of Mancozeb, bio-fumigation and soil-solarization can be used to control ginger bacterial wilt. Alternatively, bleaching powder for rhizome and soil treatment in conjunction with bio-fumigation can be employed as an integrated management system against the disease. © 2022 Eyob Aysanew Benti.

N2  - In Ethiopia, Cupressus lusitanica and Juniperus procera are important tree species. The incidence of the cypress aphid, Cinara cupressi, which has not been reported before on the exotic Cupressus lusitanica is becoming catastrophic. The appearance of the insect was reported for the first time in 2003 in Ethiopia. However, information is scarce on the status of this species in northeast Amhara state. The objectives of this study were to assess the extent of damage, abundance and status of the cypress aphid on C. lusitanica and J. procera in the protected and cultivated forests of South Wollo, Ethiopia. Results reveal that tree compositions of the three study areas differed. The dominant tree species were C. lucitanica (15–80%), Olea europaea (5–90%) and J. procera (14–70%). The cypress aphid showed significantly higher levels of infestation on C. lusitanica (35–90%) than on J. procera (1–16%). Moreover, there was higher C. lusitanica mortality (40–93%). In contrast, there was low infestation (1–16%) on J. procera and no mortality. The results reveal that the cypress aphid causes enormous losses of C. lusitanica. Therefore, it is recommended that insect surveillance be strengthened and the introduction bioagents be considered and integrated with other insecticides to minimize the degree of C. lusitanica infestation and loss. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria, a deadly disease caused by Plasmodium protozoa parasite and transmitted through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes, remains a significant public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. Efforts to eliminate malaria have increasingly focused on vector control using insecticides. However, the emergence of insecticide resistance (IR) in malaria vectors pose a formidable obstacle, and the current IR mapping models remain static, relying on fixed coefficients. This study introduces a dynamic spatio-temporal approach to characterize phenotypic resistance in Anopheles gambiae complex and Anopheles arabiensis. We developed a cellular automata (CA) model and applied it to data collected from Ethiopia, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Burkina Faso. The data encompasses georeferenced records detailing IR levels in mosquito vector populations across various classes of insecticides. In characterizing the dynamic patterns of confirmed resistance, we identified key driving factors through correlation analysis, chi-square tests, and extensive literature review. RESULTS: The CA model demonstrated robustness in capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of confirmed IR states in the vector populations. In our model, the key driving factors included insecticide usage, agricultural activities, human population density, Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) characteristics, and environmental variables. CONCLUSIONS: The CA model developed offers a robust tool for countries that have limited data on confirmed IR in malaria vectors. The embrace of a dynamical modeling approach and accounting for evolving conditions and influences, contribute to deeper understanding of IR dynamics, and can inform effective strategies for malaria vector control, and prevention in regions facing this critical health challenge.

N2  - The fall armyworm (FAW) (Spodoptera frugiperda J. E. Smith) is widely recognized as an invasive lepidopteran pest in Africa. Adoption of synthetic pesticides remains an option for emergency control of the FAW, but their large-scale use by small-scale farmers is costly and environmentally unsafe. Management options based on entomopathogenic fungi could minimize risks for health and the environment. In our study, the occurrence of entomopathogenic fungi in different habitats along with their pathogenicity to fall armyworm was examined. A total of 56 soil samples were collected from three locations. A standard isolation method, baited with the wax moth larvae (Galleria mellonella), was used for the isolation of entomopathogenic fungi from soil. Twelve entomopathogenic fungi were isolated from the total soil samples collected. It was observed that Metarhizium spp. was more frequent and widespread than Beauveria spp. and their occurrence was high in the forest habitat. Pathogenicity of indigenous entomopathogenic fungi isolates on fall armyworm larvae was tested by applying conidial suspension containing 1 × 108 spores/ml. All of the isolates tested were pathogenic to larvae of fall armyworm, with mortalities varying from 30 to 80% at 10 days posttreatment. Our results suggest that native entomopathogenic fungi could be integrated for the management of Spodoptera frugiperda larvae. © 2024 Mequanint Andualem Mekonnen et al.

N2  - This study presents the results of agroecological performance evaluation in Ethiopia. The study utilized the TAPE methodology on a relatively large number of farms (619). The results showed that transition to agroecology had a positive effect on tenure security, agricultural output, gross revenue, and diversity of Income-Generating Activities. More advanced agroecological farms were found to have better soil health and agrobiodiversity, and reduced use of chemical pesticides. They were also associated with better dietary diversity; more empowered youth and women; and created on-farm employment opportunities. These results call for support and public investments on agroecological transition in the country. © 2024 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Ethiopia's floriculture industry is exceedingly emerging, and, currently, it ranks as the sixth largest exporter of roses worldwide and second largest in Africa. Currently, many flowers, such as rose, gypsophila, carnations, and chrysanthemum, are growing. However, floriculture farms are contributing a high level of health risks and environmental problems in Ethiopia. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to scrutinize the status and impacts of floriculture industries in Ethiopia. The floriculture division is an emerging sector in Ethiopia, and the number of farms, income, job opportunities, and diversity of flowers are increasing. However, the health risks and environmental fates of the sector are also increasing. Ethiopian floriculture farms lack waste disposal technologies and workers' protective equipment and safety, and the chemicals, plastics, and corrugated irons used in the farms are carelessly disposed everywhere. Pesticides, plastics, and fertilizers are also freely discharged into water bodies and terrestrial land, which is causing the development of health risks; aquatic life hazards; and soil, water, and air pollution. However, Ethiopia has no strong and functional system or structure to control the impacts of floriculture farms. The government and the farm owners are not thoughtful about the environmental issues, health concerns, and socioeconomic impacts of the wastes. The government lacks regular control and assessment of farms, and the farms are engaging for their profit. Nevertheless, developed countries are currently using both natural and modern technologies to manage floricultural wastes. Ethiopia should therefore suggest manageable possible approaches and sound management strategies based on the findings of the analyses.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Water resource development projects are essential for increasing agricultural productivity and ensuring food security. However, these activities require the modification of pre-existing environmental settings, which may alter mosquito larval habitat availability and seasonality. The intensive utilization of current adult vector control tools results in insecticide resistance among the main vectors. When coupled with behavioural resistances, a shift in malaria vector feeding and resting behaviours could compromise the effectiveness of the current adult vector control strategies. Thus, it is important to look for new or alternative vector control interventions for immatures to complement adult control by focusing on different larval habitats and their seasonal availability. Thus, this study investigated larval habitat seasonality and seasonal larval abundance and distribution in irrigated sugar cane plantation settings in Ethiopia. METHODS: Anopheles mosquito larval habitats were surveyed and visited twice a month for a period of 14 months. Anopheline larvae and pupae were collected, reared, and fed finely ground fish food. Adults were provided with sucrose solution and kept under standard conditions. Female Anopheles mosquitoes were identified morphologically and using a species-specific PCR assay. Environmental parameters, which include habitats' physico-chemical characteristics, were assessed. Larval habitat diversity and larval abundance and distribution were determined across different seasons. RESULTS: The study revealed that Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.) was the most predominant 4197(57%) vector species, followed by Anopheles coustani complex 2388 (32.8%). Molecular analysis of sub-samples of An. gambiae s.l. resulted in Anopheles arabiensis (77.9%) and Anopheles amharicus (21.5%), and the remaining 1.1% (n = 7) sub-samples were not amplified. Physico-chemical parameters such as temperature (t = 2.22, p = 0.028), conductivity (t = 3.21, p = 0.002), dissolved oxygen (t = 7.96, p = 0.001), nitrate ion (t = 2.51, p = 0.013), and ammonium ion (t = 2.26, p = 0.025) showed a significant and direct association with mosquito larval abundance. Furthermore, mosquito larval abundance was correlated with distance to the nearest houses (r = - 0.42, p = 0.001), exposure to sunlight (r = 0.34, p = 0.001), during long and short rainy season animal hoof prints, truck tires/road puddles and rain pools were negatively correlated (r = - 0.22, p = 0.01) and types of habitat (r = - 0.20, p = 0.01). Significant habitat type productivity were observed in man-made pools (t = 3.881, P = 0.01163), rain pools, animal hoof prints, (t = - 4.332, P = 0.00749 in both short and long rainy season, whereas, during dry seasons habitat type productivity almost similar and have no significance difference. CONCLUSION: The study found that different larval habitats had variable productivity in different seasons, and that physical and physicochemical features like ammonium and nitrate, as well as the distance between larval habitats and households, are related to larval production. As a result, vector control should take into account the seasonality of Anopheles larval habitat as well as the impact of pesticide application on larval source management.

N2  - This study aimed to analyze farmers’ perceptions of maize production constraints and determine the effects of push–pull technology (PPT) on crop yield, pest control, and improving soil fertility status. Increasing fertilizer prices and pesticide prices, FAWs (fall armyworms) and stemborers, declining soil fertility, and drought are the main maize production constraints in the area. Seventy percent of the respondents indicated that an increase in input prices such as those of fertilizer and seeds is the major constraint in the area, while FAWs (55%) and stemborers (44.3%) were ranked the third and fourth major constraints. About 67% of farmers reported that stemborer damage to maize in PPT plots was either minimal or non-existent. Fifty-five percent of farmers stated that the damage caused to maize by FAWs was low or that there was no damage in PPT plots. PPT reduced stem borer infestation from 83% to 44%. The yield gained from PPT plots ranged from 18% to 31%. Soil samples taken from PPT plots showed improved soil organic carbon, organic matter, total nitrogen, and cation exchange capacity. © 2024 by the authors.

N2  - The overuse of pesticides has resulted in the accumulation of harmful residues in vegetables, which requires monitoring to assess the risks to human health. This article presents the levels of 35 pesticide residues in 15 composite vegetable samples from irrigated farmlands adjacent to Lake Ziway, Ethiopia, using the QuEChERS extraction method (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) and then analyzes them using GC-MS. The study also estimated the health risks associated with the consumption of contaminated vegetables in children and adults, including carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic risks. The predominant pesticide residues found in tomatoes were α-endosulfan (0.58 mg/kg), β-BHC (0.04 mg/kg), heptachlor (0.02 mg/kg), and malathion (0.03 mg/kg), all of which were above the safety limits. Similarly, the mean concentration of heptachlor epoxide (0.04 mg/kg) and propargite (0.11 mg/kg) was higher than the allowed levels of the safety limits for onions. The concentration of pesticide residues detected in 10.6% and 7.9% of tomato and onion samples was above the maximum residual limits of the European Commission (EU-MRLs), respectively. Noncarcinogenic health risk estimates show that onion heptachlor epoxide had THQ > 1, indicating the possibility of systemic health risk in both adult and child consumers. The carcinogenic health risk (CHR) showed that heptachlor epoxide in adults and children and only heptachlor in children had CHR > acceptable limit (10-4) for tomato and onion. Therefore, it is critical to raise awareness among stakeholders while simultaneously implementing sound monitoring policy actions to protect the ecosystem and the health of the population in the study area and beyond. © 2024 Asrat Fekadu Demsie et al.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of malaria outbreak and investigate contracting factors of malaria in Simada District, Northwest Ethiopia. A single observation original research. RESULTS: Among the total 54 cases, 44 (81.5%) of them were confirmed malaria cases. The average attack rate was 20 per 100 and slide positivity rate was 81.5%. People in the age group of 5-14 years were most affected with an attack rate of 37%. Presence of water bodies for mosquito breeding inside less than 1 km radius (AOR = 3.32, 95% CI 1.18-9.34), no knowledge on transmission, prevention and control mechanisms of malaria (AOR = 4.36, 95% CI 1.64, 12.23), not using Insecticide Treated Bed Net (AOR = 5.85, 95% CI 1.94, 17.54) and absence of environmental control (AOR = 10.01, 95% CI 2.94, 33.33) were factors associated with malaria outbreak.

N2  - Introduction: Pesticides are frequently used by plant cultivars to control pests that could affect yield. Although many local farmers in Eastern Ethiopia use organophosphate insecticides extensively for the production of khat, the pattern and treatment outcome of acute poisoning of these organophosphates has been poorly quantified and reported in this region. Materials and Method: A cross-sectional study design was employed at two public hospitals found in Harari region, Ethiopia. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews and card review, then analyzed with SPSS version 20. Pearson’s Chi-square test was used to compare independent variables with the treatment outcome. Statistical significance is defined at 95% confidence interval of odds ratio not including 1 or p < 0.05. Results: A total of 135 cases of organophosphate were admitted in the emergency departments of the hospitals during the study period. 42.2% of participants were adolescents (age: 11–20 years) while the mean age of all participants was 18.8 ± 12.9 years with a range of 1–61 years. 73.7% of the study participants were rural residents. The result showed that 47.4% of the cases were exposed to the poison accidentally. Family disharmony was the common reason among cases poisoned intentionally. The mean time elapsed between poisoning and reaching the health facility was 3.1 h. Atropine was administered for 47% of the cases. About 11% of cases expired following the poison. The home remedy given, lag time, and residency were found to be factors significantly related to poor treatment outcomes. Conclusion: Easy availability, low cost, and excessive popularity of organophosphate use as pesticides in Eastern Ethiopia have increased the incidence of ingestion, resulting in increasing intentional and unintentional poisoning. In the present study, accidental exposure accounts for 47.4%. © The Author(s) 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Congenital anomalies represent a significant contributor to infant mortality, morbidity, and enduring disability. With this in mind, the present investigation endeavour to ascertain the pooled prevalence of congenital anomalies and associated determinants among neonates in Ethiopia. METHOD: PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHAL, Hinari, and Global Health databases were systematically searched. Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) assessment checklist was used to assess quality of included studies. Data were extracted from database and exported to stataMP-17 for analysis. Pooled prevalence was determined using DerSimonian-Laird random effects model. The degree of heterogeneity and Publication bias were assessed using I2 statistics and Eggers test, respectively. Study protocol was registered under PROSPERO ID CRD42021229140. RESULT: A total of 18 studies with 519,327 participants were included in the study. Pooled prevalence of congenital anomalies in Ethiopia was 2% (95% CI: 0.02, 0.03%). Among affected newborns neural tube defect (48%) was the most common congenital anomaly in Ethiopia, followed by orofacial cleft (19%). Risk factors such as alcohol consumption (pooled OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.54, 3.38), lack of folic acid supplement (pooled OR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.09-7.36), medication during pregnancy (pooled OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.03-6.47), khat (Catha edulis) chewing (pooled OR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.61-3.71), exposure to pesticides (pooled OR: 4.45, 95% CI: 2.44-8.09) and maternal illness (pooled OR:1.79, 95% CI: 1.03, 3.10) had statistically significant association with congenital anomalies in Ethiopia. CONCLUSION: In this review, prevalence of congenital anomalies in Ethiopia was high with considerable regional variation. The most common type of congenital anomaly in Ethiopia was neural tube defects, followed by oro-facial cleft. Alcohol consumption, inadequate intake of folic acid, khat chewing, maternal diseases, exposure to pesticides, and use of medication during pregnancy were identified as potential contributors to congenital abnormalities in Ethiopia.

N2  - The efficacy of filter cake and Triplex powders applied to wheat was evaluated in the laboratory against the maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky and rice weevil, Sitophilus oryzae (Linnaeus)—two most common insect pests associated with stored grain in Ethiopia. Efficacy of these powders was determined by exposing 20 adults of each species to 100 g of wheat treated with 0, 100, 500, 700 and 1000 mg/kg of filter cake and Triplex. Adult mortality was determined 7 and 14 d after exposure. In addition, adult progeny production, percentage of insect damaged kernels, and percentage of grain weight loss at each species-powder-concentration-time combinations were determined after 42 d. The 7 and 14 d mortality was 100% for adults of both species exposed to 1000 mg/kg of filter cake; only the 14 d mortality of Sitophilus species was 100% for adults exposed to 700 mg/kg. Mortality of S. oryzae adults was 100% when exposed for 14 d to1000 mg/kg of Triplex. Mortality of S. zeamais never reached 100% in any Triplex treatments. Adult progeny production of S. zeamais was completely suppressed at filter cake concentrations of 700 and 1000 mg/kg, whereas 1000 mg/kg was necessary for complete suppression of S. oryzae adult progeny production. Complete suppression of adult progeny production was not observed in any Triplex treatments. Complete reduction in percentage of insect damaged kernels and percentage of grain weight loss were obtained when S. zeamais and S. oryzae adults were exposed to 1000 mg/kg of filter cake; similar reductions with S. zeamais occurred only at 1000 mg/kg of Triplex. In the case of S. oryzae, complete reduction of insect damaged kernels and grain weight loss were not achieved at any concentration of Triplex. These powders can be used as alternatives to chemical insecticides for management of Sitophilus species. © 2018

N2  - What is the role of Information and Communication Technology in the collective management of public bads? We study epidemics of late blight in potato as a collective action challenge in Oromia, Ethiopia. As a highly infectious, air-borne disease, potato late blight represents a public bad: it is non-excludable and non-rival. Managing public bads is a major policy challenge in Ethiopia due to structural inefficiencies and resource constraints to formal interventions. Dispersed rural farmers lack capacity and infrastructure to maintain communication flows that are key for effective collective action. We introduce an experimental, framed, public bads game where randomly selected groups of potato farmers are presented with a collective action dilemma whether to invest in a joint initiative to control late blight (fungicide spraying) or to suffer productivity loss if the threshold is missed. We also manipulate the ICT-mediated communication variable by providing access to a smartphone-based group communicator to a random sub-sample of the participants. We find that collective action problems do occur and participants tend to free-ride on the efforts of others. We show that ICT-mediated communication has a statistically significant positive effect on cooperative behavior, disease control, returns on investment and game winnings. Our qualitative analysis of the voice chats provides evidence that farmers use ICT to: (1) facilitate complex coordination, (2) establish collective norms, (3) detect and pressure 'free riders', and (4) manage reputation to increase trust. This paper complements the existing literature on public bads by studying real-life stakeholders in a real-life collective action challenge. It contributes to the literature on the contested topic of 'ICTrevolution' and its supposed transforming effect on African agriculture. From the point of view of policy, we draw attention to the pivotal importance of improving communication infrastructure in rural regions of Ethiopia, and the opportunities to scale collective action interventions through ICT. © 2020 The Authors

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria intervention in Ethiopia has been strengthened significantly in the past decade. The Ethiopian government recently stratified the country based upon annual parasite incidence into malaria free, low, moderate and high transmission strata. Districts with low transmission were targeted for indigenous transmission elimination. Surveillance on malaria disease incidence is needed for planning control and elimination efforts. METHODS: Clinical malaria was monitored prospectively in health facilities in Jimma town, Oromia Region, southwestern Ethiopia from July 2014 to June 2015. Seasonal cross-sectional parasite prevalence surveys in local communities were conducted in 2014 and 2015 in eight kebeles. Case report forms were administered to obtain sociodemographic and epidemiological information from patients. RESULTS: A total of 1434 suspected malaria cases were examined from the health facilities and 428 confirmed malaria cases were found. Among them, 327 (76.4 %) cases were Plasmodium vivax, 97 (22.7 %) were Plasmodium falciparum, and 4 (0.9 %) were mixed infection of P. vivax and P. falciparum. The annual malaria incidence rate was 1.7 cases per 1000 people at risk. Parasite prevalence in the community was less than 3 %. Household ownership of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) was 47.3 % (1173/2479) and ITN usage was 37.9 %. All ITNs were long-lasting insecticidal nets, and repellent use was not found in the study area. Being male and traveling were the significant risk factors for P. falciparum malaria. For P. vivax malaria, risk factors included occupation and history of malaria illness during the preceding 30 days. CONCLUSION: Epidemiological evidence suggested low clinical malaria incidence and prevalence in Jimma town. More aggressive measures may be needed to further suppress vivax transmission. Strategies should be planned targeting sustained control and elimination.

N2  - Agricultural land use and tenure systems in many African countries are characterized by subsistence production and a communal land tenure system. Reforming the tenure system in a way that ensures tenure security could promote sustainable agriculture in the region. In addition, the right of women to own land is essential for rural development. This chapter, therefore, analyses the gender differential effects of land tenure security on productivity in East Africa using Living Standard Measurement Study data from Ethiopia and Tanzania. The chapter uses plot- and household-level data to investigate the effect of land title and other determinants of crop productivity. The main results show that tenure security positively and significantly affects households’ productivity in general and is marginally significant for female-headed households in particular. Potential indicators that positively correlate with crop productivity are total land and plot sizes, inorganic fertilizer use, input credit access, herbicide use, soil, and plot type. Policy implications are based on the results. © 2020, The Author(s).

N2  - The seeds of Millettia ferruginea are used in fishing, pesticides, and folk medicine in Ethiopia. Here, the anti-cancer effects of isoflavones isolated from M. ferruginea were evaluated in human ovarian cancer cells. We found that isoflavone ferrugone and 6,7-dimethoxy-3′,4′- methylenedioxy-8-(3,3-dimethylallyl)isoflavone (DMI) had potent cytotoxic effects on human ovarian cancer cell A2780 and SKOV3. Ferrugone and DMI treatment increased the sub-G1 cell population in a dose-dependent manner in A2780 cells. The cytotoxic activity of ferrugone and DMI was associated with the induction of apoptosis, as shown by an increase in annexin V-positive cells. Z-VAD-fmk, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, and z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, significantly reversed both the ferrugone and DMI-induced apoptosis, suggesting that cell death stimulated by the isoflavones is mediated by caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Additionally, ferrugone-induced apoptosis was found to be caspase-8-dependent, while DMI-induced apoptosis was caspase-9-dependent. Notably, DMI, but not ferrugone, increased the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) attenuated the proapoptotic activity of DMI. These data suggest that DMI induced apoptotic cell death through the intrinsic pathway via ROS production, while ferrugone stimulated the extrinsic pathway in human ovarian cancer cells. © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Coffee is the foundation of Ethiopia’s economy with a quarter of the population dependent on coffee production and exports for livelihood. However, most empirical research in coffee production focuses on the productivity factors like yields rather than socio-economic factors that can significantly influence the level of coffee production. Thus, this essay explores the determinants of smallholders’ coffee production in Wolaita zone, Ethiopia by applying the ordered logistic regression model. This model estimates the coffee production status of smallholders by combining the effect of multiple productivity related biophysical and socio-economic factors. Using a multistage sample procedure, two farmers associations from each district were chosen for the research. Overall sample sizes of 250 households were interviewed door-to-door to generate quantitative data. Data was analyzed by using SPSS software and descriptive statistical techniques were applied in order to determine the coffee production status of the farm households. The results indicated that about 88.8% of the smallholder farm households fell under the yield category of ‘low producer’, which is an indicator that numerous variables provide challenges to the smallholder coffee production in the studied area. The results of the regression study showed that of the eighteen variables in the model, seven variables including irrigation access, pruning practice, household farm land size, training access, pesticide utilization, manure application, and cultivated land allocation were discovered to be the important predictors of farm families’ coffee production status in the research region. It can be recommended that establishment of government sponsored irrigation systems, empowerment on utilization of appropriate coffee farm technologies and inputs for the areas, enhancing extension services to improve farmers’ skill and knowledge on coffee production system and risk alleviating mechanisms, developing soil fertility mechanisms, establishment of farmers training centers in the vicinities of producers, building capacity of institutions are vital to motivate coffee producers and increase productivity and coffee output in the research area and areas with similar situations. © (2024), (African Journal of Food).

N2  - Since its first detection in 2012 in Djibouti, Anopheles stephensi has invaded and established in the Horn of Africa, and more recently Nigeria. The expansion of this vector poses a significant threat to malaria control and elimination efforts. Integrated vector management is the primary strategy used to interrupt disease transmission; however, growing insecticide resistance is threatening to reverse gains in global malaria control. We present a next-generation amplicon-sequencing approach, for high-throughput monitoring of insecticide resistance genes (ace1, GSTe2, vgsc and rdl), species identification and characterization of genetic diversity (its2 and cox1) in An. stephensi. Ninety-five An. stephensi mosquitoes, collected in Ethiopia, were screened, identifying 104 SNPs, including the knock-down mutation L958F (L1014F in Musca domestica), and for the first time in this vector species, the A296S substitution (A301S in Drosophila melanogaster) in the rdl locus. Two other amino acid substitutions (ace1-N177D, GSTe2-V189L) were also identified but have not been previously implicated in insecticide resistance. Genetic diversity in the mitochondrial cox1 gene revealed shared haplotypes between Ethiopian An. stephensi with samples from Pakistan, Sudan, and Djibouti. Overall, we present a reliable, cost-effective strategy using amplicon-sequencing to monitor known insecticide resistance mutations, with the potential to identify new genetic variants, to assist in the high-throughput surveillance of insecticide resistance in An. stephensi populations.

N2  - Background: The value chains of tomatoes in Ethiopia are largely informal which may pose potential food safety risks. Value chains (VCs) mapping was carried out with emphasis on tomatoes in two major cities in eastern Ethiopia—Harar and Dire Dawa—which were assessed to identify practices likely to result in unsafe food, considering production, transportation, retail, preparation, and consumption. Methods: Qualitative methods were used to map the VCs to understand the flows, actors, and practices. Group discussions and key informant interviews were performed to better understand the processes, practices, beliefs, and food safety risks in these VCs. Results: The two cities are supplied by two vegetable VCs: the first and larger being from distant producers in central Ethiopia, and the second from surrounding rural and peri-urban producers. The long-distance VCs involve producers, brokers, transporters, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers. The local producers, however, bring their fresh products directly to the cities without the involvement of VC actors other than final retailers and consumers. The study suggests microbiological contamination risks along tomato VCs, potentially including soil contamination, use of sewerage-contaminated irrigation water, untreated manure, unhygienic handling and storage conditions, and dirty contact surfaces during transportation and retailing. Tomatoes are mostly harvested by hand picking, collected, and sorted on the ground exposing to sunlight and physical bruising with potential contamination. More importantly, tomatoes are widely consumed raw without “a kill-step” that certainly contributes to food-borne infections. Suggestions by study participants for improving food safety and hygiene include funding toward improved infrastructure and facilities in the sectors, supporting VC actors with improved technology for quality production, and increasing awareness of good and hygienic practices. Consumers were particularly concerned about contamination with agrochemicals without much emphasis on the potential microbial contaminants. Fresh tomatoes are prepared in a variety of ways and are often consumed raw or slightly cooked. Further recommendations included using health extension workers to conduct awareness campaigns on improved food safety and hygienic practices. Conclusion: The qualitative VC mapping generated useful information for designing intervention strategies, especially targeting developing food safety interventions and an awareness communication campaign.

N2  - A deltamethrin 'pour-on' insecticide was applied monthly to over 2000 cattle exposed to a high challenge of drug-resistant trypanosomes and high tsetse re-invasion pressure in the Ghibe valley, south-west Ethiopia. Blood samples were taken monthly from an average of 760 cattle for determination of PCV and presence of trypanosomes. The area of the valley is approximately 350 km2 and the cattle grazed in roughly four locations covering about a quarter to half of the area. Two years before the trial commenced, Glossina morsitans submorsitans Newstead (Diptera: Glossinidae) began to invade the valley. Despite the use of the pour-on the mean apparent density of G. m. submorsitans continued to rise, and, during the 4 years of tsetse control, was more than three-fold higher than that recorded during the previous 18 months. Over the same period there was little change in the apparent density of Glossina pallidipes Austen (Diptera: Glossinidae). By contrast, the mean monthly prevalence of trypanosome infections in cattle over 36 months of age decreased from 38.3 to 29.0%, the incidence of new infections decreased from 26.6 to 16.0% (a reduction of 40%), and packed cell volume in cattle increased from 21.7 to 24.1%. Evidence of a change in apparent parasite transmission rate was demonstrated by regression of infection incidence in cattle on the logarithm of apparent density of G. m. submorsitans. Before the trial started the regression coefficient was 45.8 +/- 6.3 and this reduced to 9.2 +/- 2.5% incidence per log(e) (flies/trap/day) during the period of tsetse control. It was concluded that this indicated reductions in tsetse numbers in the immediate vicinities of cattle in a way that was not reflected in overall tsetse catches. Nevertheless, the comparatively high levels of trypanosome prevalence that persisted in the cattle demonstrates that, where invasion prevalence is high, treatment of small pockets of cattle will not eradicate tsetse. To achieve more significant reduction in trypanosome prevalence in cattle, integrated methods of control utilizing target barriers in the major routes of invasion will be needed.

N2  - Malaria control programs in Africa encounter daunting challenges that hinder progressive steps toward elimination of the disease. These challenges include widespread insecticide resistance in mosquito vectors, increasing outdoor malaria transmission, lack of vector surveillance and control tools suitable for outdoor biting vectors, weakness in malaria surveillance, and an inadequate number of skilled healthcare personnel. Ecological and epidemiological changes induced by environmental modifications resulting from water resource development projects pose additional barriers to malaria control. Cognizant of these challenges, our International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) works in close collaboration with relevant government ministries and agencies to align its research efforts with the objectives and strategies of the national malaria control and elimination programs for the benefit of local communities. Our overall goal is to assess the impact of water resource development projects, shifting agricultural practices, and vector interventions on Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria in Kenya and Ethiopia. From 2017 to date, the ICEMR has advanced knowledge of malaria epidemiology, transmission, immunology, and pathogenesis, and developed tools to enhance vector surveillance and control, improved clinical malaria surveillance and diagnostic methods, and strengthened the capacity of local healthcare providers. Research findings from the ICEMR will inform health policy and strategic planning by ministries of health in their quest to sustain malaria control and achieve elimination goals.

N2  - Wheat stem rust disease is threatening the production of wheat in Ethiopia. The experiment was conducted to evaluate the integrated effects of wheat varieties and inorganic salt foliar sprays to manage wheat stem rust on three wheat varieties, one susceptible (Morocco), one moderately resistant (Tay) and one resistant variety (Hoggana) at Adet and Aneded in 2018 cropping season. The experiment was laid out in a randomised complete block design with a factorial arrangement in three replications. Wheat stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici was significantly (p < 0.05) controlled by the sprays of potassium carbonate at the rate of 15 g l−1 concentration at both locations. The study results showed that the lowest rust severity, the area under the disease progress curve and slower disease progress rate occurred on the resistant and moderately resistant varieties sprayed with Tilt 250 EC and followed by potassium carbonate than on the susceptible variety with Tilt 250 EC, potassium carbonate and/or with potassium bicarbonate at both locations. Potassium carbonate reduced the disease severity without any significant difference to the recommended fungicide Tilt 250 EC at the rate of 1.5 l ha−1 on Hoggana variety at Aneded, which showed us potassium carbonate can be used as an alternative option to manage stem rust in wheat. Potassium carbonate foliar spray reduced relative grain yield loss by 36.05 and 3.9% at Adet whereas 28.5 and 2.03% at Aneded on the Hoggana compared to the varieties Morocco and Tay, respectively, which is comparable to Tilt 250 EC. In conclusion, when growing moderately resistant wheat varieties, potassium carbonate may be used in place of commercially recommended fungicide Tilt 250 EC yielding comparable results. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are severe birth defects caused by nutritional, genetic or environmental factors. Because NTDs continue to have a significant health and economic impact on children and community at large, it is crucial to investigate potential risk factors in order to develop novel approaches to NTDs prevention. Determinants for the development of NTDs differ by country, region as well as within the country. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of NTDs among newborns delivered in three hospitals found in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among 138 cases and 138 control women who delivered in three teaching hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia in 2021. Data were collected using a structured and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Cases were mothers who delivered a neonate with any type of NTDs regardless of gestational age or fetal viability, whereas controls were mothers who delivered an apparently healthy newborn. Chi-square was used to assess the significant difference between the two groups. Conditional logistic regression model was used to generate adjusted odds ratio with its corresponding 95% confidence intervals and compare the two groups. RESULTS: Anencephaly (51.4%) and spinal bifida (34.1%) were the most frequently observed NTDs. None of study participants took preconception folic acid supplementation. Being a non-formal mothers (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12-0.92, P = 0.034), rural residence, (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.18-9.78, P = 0.023), history of spontaneous abortion (AOR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.15-7.55, P = 0.023), having severe anemia (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.17-9.87, P = 0.024), history of fever or cold (AOR = 2.75; 95% CI: 1.05-7.15, P = 0.038), and an exposure to various agro-chemicals (AOR = 3.39, 95% CI: 1.11-10.3, P = 0.032) were independent determinants of NTDs. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION: In this study, NTDs were associated to several determinant factors in the area, including residential area, history of spontaneous abortion, severe anemia, fever/cold, antibiotic use before or during early pregnancy, and exposure to agrochemicals. Addressing the identified determinants is critical in averting the incidence of NTDs in the study area. Moreover, more research is needed to investigate women's dietary practices as well as the practice of preconception folic acid supplementation for pregnant women in Ethiopia's current health care system.

N2  - Food security is paramount for developing nations grappling with chal-lenges like population growth, limited arable land, and climate change. To tackle these issues, fostering innovation in agriculture and environmental sustainability is crucial. In the developing world, environmental degradation primarily stems from deforestation, land degradation, and water scarcity that harm agriculture by dimin-ishing biodiversity, essential for soil fertility and pollination. Furthermore, land degradation reduces available cultivable land, posing a substantial obstacle to agricul-tural production in many developing nations. Climate change-induced water scarcity hinders agriculture in developing nations. Agrarian innovation, such as sustain-able intensification, utilizes advanced technology to increase productivity while minimizing environmental impact. Precision agriculture optimizes yields, conserves resources, and reduces environmental harm. Conservation agriculture, employing practices like crop rotation and cover cropping, preserves soil fertility and reduces input dependency, like fertilizers and pesticides, exemplifying innovative agricultural approaches. Achieving food security in developing nations necessitates both agri-cultural and environmental sustainability innovation. This entails adopting renew-able energy sources such as solar and wind power to reduce fossil fuel dependence and greenhouse gas emissions. Agroforestry, involving tree planting on agricul-tural land, enhances soil fertility, carbon sequestration, and environmental bene-fits, showcasing sustainability innovation. Numerous case studies underscore the importance of environmental and agricultural innovation in enhancing food security in developing nations. The Green Revolution in India, utilizing high-yield crops, fertilizers, and irrigation, significantly boosted agricultural output. Precision agri-culture in India increased yields while conserving resources. Conservation agri-culture improved output and reduced input demand in Africa, as seen in Zambia. Agroforestry in Ethiopia enhanced soil fertility and climate resilience for farmers. Environmental degradation and limited arable land hinder agricultural output in many emerging nations, necessitating inventive solutions for food security. Preci-sion, conservation, and sustainable intensification represent agricultural innovations, while agroforestry and renewable energy sources signify environmental sustain-ability innovations. India and Africa’s case studies highlight how innovation can enhance agricultural productivity and address global food security challenges. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

N2  - Each year, up to three million deaths due to malaria and close to five billion episodes of clinical illness possibly meriting antimalarial therapy occur throughout the world, with Africa having more than 90% of this burden. Almost 3% of disability adjusted life years are due to malaria mortality globally, 10% in Africa. New information is presented in this supplement on malaria-related perinatal mortality, occurrence of human immunodeficiency virus in pregnancy, undernutrition, and neurologic, cognitive, and developmental sequelae. The entomologic determinants of transmission and uses of modeling for program planning and disease prediction and prevention are discussed. New data are presented from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Zimbabwe on the increasing urban malaria problem and on epidemic malaria. Between 6% and 28% of the malaria burden may occur in cities, which comprise less than 2% of the African surface. Macroeconomic projections show that the costs are far greater than the costs of individual cases, with a substantial deleterious impact of malaria on schooling of patients, external investments into endemic countries, and tourism. Poor populations are at greatest risk; 58% of the cases occur in the poorest 20% of the world's population and these patients receive the worst care and have catastrophic economic consequences from their illness. This social vulnerability requires better understanding for improving deployment, access, quality, and use of effective interventions. Studies from Ghana and elsewhere indicate that for every patient with febrile illness assumed to be malaria seen in health facilities, 4-5 episodes occur in the community. Effective actions for malaria control mandate rational public policies; market forces, which often drive sales and use of drugs and other interventions, are unlikely to guarantee their use. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria is rapidly gaining acceptance as an effective approach for countering the spread and intensity of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine, sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, and other antimalarial drugs. Although costly, ACT ($1.20-2.50 per adult treatment) becomes more cost-effective as resistance to alternative drugs increases; early use of ACT may delay development of resistance to these drugs and prevent the medical toll associated with use of ineffective drugs. The burden of malaria in one district in Tanzania has not decreased since the primary health care approach replaced the vertical malaria control efforts of the 1960s. Despite decentralization, this situation resulted, in part, from weak district management capacity, poor coordination, inadequate monitoring, and lack of training of key staff. Experience in the Solomon Islands showed that spraying with DDT, use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and health education were all associated with disease reduction. The use of nets permitted a reduction in DDT spraying, but could not replace it without an increased malaria incidence. Baseline data and reliable monitoring of key outcome indicators are needed to measure whether the ambitious goals for the control of malaria and other diseases has occurred. Such systems are being used for evidence-based decision making in Tanzania and several other countries. Baseline cluster sampling surveys in several countries across Africa indicate that only 53% of the children with febrile illness in malarious areas are being treated; chloroquine (CQ) is used 84% of the time, even where the drug may be ineffective. Insecticide-treated bed nets were used only 2% of the time by children less than five years of age. Progress in malaria vaccine research has been substantial over the past five years; 35 candidate malaria vaccines are in development, many of which are in clinical trials. Development of new vaccines and drugs has been the result of increased investments and formation of public-private partnerships. Before malaria vaccine becomes deployed, consideration must be given to disease burden, cost-effectiveness, financing, delivery systems, and approval by regulatory agencies. Key to evaluation of vaccine effectiveness will be collection and prompt analysis of epidemiologic information. Training of persons in every aspect of malaria research and control is essential for programs to succeed. The Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM) is actively promoting research capacity strengthening and has established networks of institutions and scientists throughout the African continent, most of whom are now linked by modern information-sharing networks. Evidence over the past century is that successful control malaria programs have been linked to strong research activities. To ensure effective coordination and cooperation between the growing number of research and control coalitions forming in support of malaria activities, an umbrella group is needed. With continued support for scientists and control workers globally, particularly in low-income malarious countries, the long-deferred dream of malaria elimination can become a reality.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria can be prevented using cost-effective interventions. It can be prevented at large via the use of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs). The use of ITNs decreases malaria mortality rates by 55% in under-5 years old children in Africa, Ethiopia, realizing the effectiveness, scaling up distribution and utilization of ITNs to cover 100% of children less than 5 years of age. However, little is known about ITNs utilization and factors associated with the utilization in under-5 years old children in the study area yet. The purpose of this study was to assess the level and associated factors of ITNs utilization in under-5 years old children among households with under-5 years old children of Mirab Abaya District, Gamo Gofa Zone, Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted during August-September, 2016. Six study Kebeles were identified by simple random sampling technique and 398 households with at least one under-5 years old children were selected by random sampling technique using computer generated random numbers from health post family folders. Structured, interviewer questionnaire was administered to mothers or care givers of the children. Data were entered to Epi Info Version 3.5 and analyzed in SPSS version 21 statistical software. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was done. P-value <0.05 and odds ratio with 95% confidence interval were used for the determination of associations between dependent and predictor variables. Results were presented in narrations, tables, and graph. RESULT: Among 398 under-5 years old children assessed, the majority, 362 (91.0%) of them had access to ITN, but only 137 (37.2%) of the child had ITNs utilization during the previous night prior to the survey. Households with age of mothers or caretakers 31-44 years, AOR = 0.03, 95% CI (0.01-0.07) and ≥45 years of age; AOR = 0.05, 95% CI (0.01-0.58); households with family size ≤5 members, AOR = 11.23, 95% CI (4.31-29.24); and households with sleeping space ≥2, AOR = 13.59, 95% CI (4.40-41.93) were found to be significantly associated with under-5 years old children ITNs utilization. CONCLUSION: Even though, a significant proportions of under-5 years old children had access to ITN, only one-third of the participant child utilized it properly.

N2  - Anemia is a widespread public health problem that affects all stages of life particularly preschool children and pregnant mothers. Anemia among children had significant impact on their growth, development, school performance and mortality. Different strategies like deworming of young children, vitamin A supplementation for children aged 6–59 months, and ferrous sulphate supplementation and provision of insecticide treated bed net for pregnant women were designed to control and prevent anemia. Also, previous studies on anemia factors were conducted but they were not considering the ordered nature of anemia. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the factors of anemia severity levels among children aged 6–59 months in Ethiopia by using ordinal analysis based on Bayesian hierarchical statistical approach. A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data. A total of 8483 weighted children were included. Due to the ordered nature of the anemia and nested nature of DHS data, ordinal logistic regression model based on hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach was employed to identify the determinants of anemia severity levels. In this study, moderate anemia level was found to be the commonest type which accounts around 29.4%. Female children, poorer, middle, and richest wealth index, primary maternal education and having ANC visit had lower risk of having higher order of anemia. Moderate maternal anemia and stunted children had higher chance of having higher order of anemia. Children age had significant different effect on mild and moderate anemia. Meanwhile, multiple birth/s and deworming had effect on moderate anemia. In addition, normal birth weight had also significant and different effect on mild and severe anemia and history of feverlike illness on mild anemia. The prevalence of anemia among children aged 6–59 months anemia was found to be a severe public health problem. Children age, sex, maternal education, child stunting, history of fever, multiple birth, birth weight, provision of deworming and maternal anemia was found to be the most important factors for child anemia severity levels. Therefore, intervention efforts to control and prevent anemia in Ethiopia requires targeting of these hindering factors. © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - We assessed potential effects of local meteorological and environmental conditions, indoor residual spraying with insecticides, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) use at individual and community levels, and individual factors on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence in a village in south Ethiopia. A cohort of 8,121 people was followed for 101 weeks with active and passive surveillance. Among 317 microscopically confirmed P. falciparum malaria episodes, 29.3% occurred among temporary residents. The incidence density was 3.6/10,000 person-weeks of observation. We observed higher malaria incidence among males, children 5-14 years of age, ITNs non-users, the poor, and people who lived closer to vector breeding places. Rainfall increased and indoor residual spraying with Deltamethrin reduced falciparum incidence. Although ITNs prevented falciparum malaria for the users, we did not find that free mass ITNs distribution reduced falciparum malaria on a village level.

N2  - The Nile Basin consists of a number of ecological zones between two extreme opposites: the rainforest in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Sahara desert, which receives almost no rain. Some regions receive most or exclusively all of their water from the Nile, while others receive most of the water from rain, or from a combination of water sources. Still, it is the water in the Nile which links the otherwise different ecological zones together. It is the rains in the DRC, Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia which provide the Nile with water so the river can flow and give life to barren and desert areas in Sudan and Egypt. Some places become drier and experience more droughts, whereas others are more regularly flooded or experience more fluctuations in precipitation patterns. These are overall climatic premises, but there are also human factors. The richness of species depends partly on climate variables such as temperature and rainfall patterns but also on population pressure and human activities and their interaction with the environment. This chapter describes aspects of environmental issues of ecosystem and biodiversity, endangered species, and threats to biodiversity in the Nile Basin countries to provide a partial illustration of the diversity of ecosystem and the habitat types that exist to support a variety of living organisms. In addition, the chapter describes the case study of Lake Nasser. The study showed that there are several problems that can reduce the species biodiversity in the Nile Basin countries. Some of these problems are, but not limited to, inefficient water use, water pollution, population pressure and land degradation, deforestation and soil loss, over hunting and fishing, and sedimentation. In addition, the study concluded that the main sources of biodiversity degradation in Lake Nasser are development of land, expansion of agricultural land, and disappearance of habitat from excessive grazing or application of agrochemicals, and also habitats are being polluted and hunting, fishing, and tourism activities are disturbing the natural habitat especially within the shoreline zone. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

N2  - Previous studies investigated the effects of seed rates and seed recycling practices on the yield and yield-related variables. However, higher yield does not always guarantee cost-efficiency. This study aimed to investigate the yield effects of plot-level seed rate and the cost–benefit analysis of seed recycling practices. This study has introduced the dose–response model to the existing analytical methods used in analyzing the effect of different agrochemicals on crop yield. A multi- stage stratified sampling technique was used to select a total of 450 sample respondents. Data were gathered using a mix of data collection tools. Descriptive statistics along with the dose– response model were applied for data analysis. Farmers of the study were found to be dissimilar in terms of their seed rate application. A dose–response analysis indicated that the highest average wheat yield was associated with a seed rate of 50 kg ha−1 above what is recommended. The yield effect of seed recycling was also assessed, and a one-time seed recycling has caused a yield decline of 665 kg ha−1 compared to the non-recycled seeds. The cost reduced using recycled seed is by far lower than the economic gains associated with using unrecycled and fresh seeds. The cost–benefit analysis made clear that farmers can reduce their seed costs through seed recycling, but their yields and net income can be best improved by using unrecycled certified bread wheat seed (CBWS). Thus, farmers must be encouraged to use unrecycled seed by establishing agricultural credit schemes geared towards seed procurement and seed price subsidy as key strategies to reduce economically wasteful seed recycling practices. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles funestus, which is considered as secondary vector of malaria in Ethiopia, is known to have several morphologically indistinguishable (sibling) species. Accurate identification of sibling species is crucial to understand their biology, behaviour and vector competence. In this study, molecular identification was conducted on the Ethiopian An. funestus populations. Moreover, insecticide resistance mechanism markers were detected, including ace N485I, kdr L1014F, L1014S, and CYP6P9a TaqMan qPCR was used to detect the infective stage of the parasite from field collected adult female An. funestus populations. METHODS: Adult female mosquito collection was conducted from Lare, Gambella Regional State of Ethiopia between June 2018 to July 2020 using CDC light traps and HLC. Sub-samples of the morphologically identified An. funestus mosquitoes were molecularly identified using species-specific PCR, and the possible presence of insecticide resistance alleles was investigated using TaqMan qPCR (N485I-Ace-1), PCR-Sanger sequencing (L1014F-kdr), and PCR-RFLP (CYP6P9a resistance allele). Following head/thorax dissection, the TaqMan qPCR assay was used to investigate the presence of the infective stage Plasmodium parasite species. RESULTS: A total of 1086 adult female An. funestus mosquitoes were collected during the study period. All sub-samples (N = 20) that were morphologically identified as An. funestus sensu lato (s.l.) were identified as An. funestus sensu stricto (s.s.) using species- specific PCR assay. The PCR-RFLP assay that detects the CYP6P9a resistance allele that confers pyrethroid resistance in An. funestus was applied in N = 30 randomly selected An. funestus s.l. SPECIMENS: None of the specimens showed a digestion pattern consistent with the presence of the CYP6P9a resistance allele in contrast to what was observed in the positive control. Consequently, all samples were characterized as wild type. The qPCR TaqMan assay that detects the N485I acetylcholinesterase-1 mutation conferring resistance to organophosphates/carbamates in An. funestus was used in (N = 144) samples. All samples were characterized as wild type. The kdr L1014F and L1014S mutations in the VGSC gene that confer resistance to pyrethroids and DDT were analysed with direct Sanger sequencing after PCR and clean-up of the PCR products were also characterized as wild type. None of the samples (N = 169) were found positive for Plasmodium (P. falciparum/ovale/malariae/vivax) detection. CONCLUSION: All An. funestus s.l. samples from Lare were molecularly identified as An. funestus s.s. No CYP6P9, N485I acetylcholinesterase 1, kdr L1014F or L1014S mutations were detected in the An. funestus samples. None of the An. funestus samples were positive for Plasmodium. Although the current study did not detect any insecticide resistant mechanism, it provides a reference for future vector monitoring programmes. Regular monitoring of resistance mechanisms covering wider geographical areas of Ethiopia where this vector is distributed is important for improving the efficacy of vector control programs.

N2  - The overuse of pesticides and fertilizers to grow high-quality roses unintentionally introduces heavy metals into the soil which is detrimental to the human health. Thus, the aim of the current study is to examine the concentrations of the essential (Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, Cu, Fe, Mn and Ni) and toxic metals (Cd and Pb) in the soil samples from the flower farm using Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) and to assess the risk that heavy metals pose to human health. To obtain an optimum condition for the wet digestion of soil samples, the volume ratio of reagents, reflux time and temperature were optimized. The concentrations of Ca, Fe, Mn, Mg, Zn, Cr, Ni, Cu were found to be 3468, 4926, 450, 255, 74, 70,48.5 and 25 and 2150, 4862,472, 241, 71, 58, 37 and 12.5 mg/kg for the soil samples collected from the flower farm and road side, respectively. Cadmium and lead were not detected in the studied soil samples. Statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed the concentrations of Ca and Cu in the two soil samples are significantly different. Correlation analysis showed there was strong positive association for Fe with Zn, Cr and Ni, Mg with Ca, Cu, Ni and Cr, Zn with Cr and Cu and Ni with (Cu, Zn and Cr). Values of hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) for the heavy metals under the study in the all exposure pathways are below 1.0 indicating that none of them could be harmful to human health. © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Woody species have been introduced in many parts of the world to provide economic benefits, but some of those species are now among the worst invaders, causing widespread economic and environmental damage. Management of woody species to restore original ecosystem services, such as biodiverse grassland that can provide fodder and sequester carbon, are needed to limit the impacts of alien species. However, the best management methods, i.e., the most economically efficient and effective way to remove trees and the most effective way to restore or rehabilitate the cleared land, are not developed for many species. In Eastern Africa, prosopis (Prosopis julifora) has invaded large areas of savanna and grassland, thereby affecting, among other things, fodder and water for livestock, access to dry season grazing lands and ultimately pastoral livelihoods. We tested three prosopis treatments (manual uprooting and cut stump and basal bark herbicide application) in combination with three incremental restoration interventions (divots, divots + mulching, divots + mulching + grass seed sowing). The three-year study was replicated in Ethiopia (Afar National Regional State), Kenya (Baringo county) and Tanzania (Moshi district). Prosopis survival and vegetation development, both diversity and biomass, were recorded. The prosopis treatments were all highly effective (between 85 and 100% tree mortality in almost all cases), but the two treatments that involved the complete removal of the aboveground biomass (manual and cut stump) yielded a more productive and more diverse vegetation than the treatment that killed the trees standing (basal bark). Compared to the effect of prosopis removal, the effect of restoration interventions on vegetation composition was small, indicating that most species re-established from the soil seed bank. The results show that it is possible to restore land previously invaded by prosopis. Despite the different rates of vegetation establishment and variation in species composition, the restoration interventions resulted in vegetation that in some cases contained a substantial fraction of perennial grasses. The method chosen to control prosopis depends on the availability of resources, including herbicides, and the need to remove rootstocks if the intention is to plant crops.

N2  - Anopheles stephensi is a malaria vector that has been recently introduced into East Africa, where it threatens to increase malaria disease burden. The use of insecticides, especially pyrethroids, is still one of the primary malaria vector control strategies worldwide. The knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation in the IIS6 transmembrane segment of the voltage-gated sodium channel (vgsc) is one of the main molecular mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles. Extensive pyrethroid resistance in An. stephensi has been previously reported in Ethiopia. Thus, it is important to determine whether or not the kdr mutation is present in An. stephensi populations in Ethiopia to inform vector control strategies. In the present study, the kdr locus was analyzed in An. stephensi collected from ten urban sites (Awash Sebat Kilo, Bati, Dire Dawa, Degehabur, Erer Gota, Godey, Gewane, Jigjiga, Semera, and Kebridehar) situated in Somali, Afar, and Amhara regions, and Dire Dawa Administrative City, to evaluate the frequency and evolution of kdr mutations and the association of the mutation with permethrin resistance phenotypes. Permethrin is one of the pyrethroid insecticides used for vector control in eastern Ethiopia. DNA extractions were performed on adult mosquitoes from CDC light trap collections and those raised from larval and pupal collections. PCR and targeted sequencing were used to analyze the IIS6 transmembrane segment of the vgsc gene. Of 159 An. stephensi specimens analyzed from the population survey, nine (5.7%) carried the kdr mutation (L1014F). An. stephensi with kdr mutations were only observed from Bati, Degehabur, Dire Dawa, Gewane, and Semera. We further selected randomly twenty resistant and twenty susceptible An. stephensi mosquitoes from Dire Dawa post-exposure to permethrin and investigated the role of kdr in pyrethroid resistance by comparing the vgsc gene in the two populations. We found no kdr mutations in the permethrin-resistant mosquitoes. Population genetic analysis of the sequences, including neighboring introns, revealed limited evidence of non-neutral evolution (e.g., selection) at this locus. The low kdr mutation frequency detected and the lack of kdr mutation in the permethrin-resistant mosquitoes suggest the existence of other molecular mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance in eastern Ethiopian An. stephensi.

N2  - Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium spp. is an emerging destructive wheat disease in Ethiopia. This disease significantly reduces grain yield and quality leading to small, shriveled, lightweight kernels and subsequently contaminating the grain with mycotoxins, particularly deoxynivalenol (DON). Field experiments were conducted in Mareko district, southern Ethiopia during the 2020 and 2021 main cropping seasons to determine the impact of integrated wheat variety resistance and fungicide application against FHB development and associated DON. Three bread wheat varieties (Denda'a, Hidase, and Kingbird), two fungicides (propiconazole and tebuconazole), and untreated wheat were used as a treatment in a split-plot design arranged in three replications. The main plots received wheat varieties, while the subplots received fungicides. The effect of fungicides on the FHB severity index was highly significant. Propiconazole and tebuconazole spraying at the anthesis growth stage reduced FHB incidence, severity, Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK), and DON contamination in harvested grain while increasing thousand seed weight and yield in all varieties. Kingbird variety sprayed with tebuconazole had low mean FHB disease severity (19.33 and 20.20%), disease progression (0.0065 and 0.0079 units day–1), and AUDPC (316.52 and 330.17%-days) in 2020 and 2021, respectively. High mean grain yields were also obtained from a variety of Kingbird sprayed with tebuconazole. Furthermore, fungicide efficacy was found to be higher in the Kingbird variety treated with tebuconazole, with a 67% DON contamination reduction compared to the control. Unsprayed plots of each variety had the highest disease severity, DON contamination, AUDPC, and the lowest grain yield in both cropping years. The efficacy of fungicides in reducing the FHB severity index and yield increase was lower in the susceptible variety (Denda’a). Grain yield was negatively correlated to severity index, FDK, and DON, whereas the latter traits were positively correlated among themselves. The study indicated that fungicide efficacy in reducing FHB, and increasing grain yield was higher in moderately resistant varieties than in susceptible ones. The results imply that integrating fungicide application at the anthesis growth stage with moderately resistant variety is a more effective management approach for reducing FHB and DON contamination in wheat, than either approach used alone, and increasing wheat production and food security in major wheat growing areas of Ethiopia. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society of Crop Science (KSCS) 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the ecology and behaviour of disease vectors, including the olfactory cues used to orient and select hosts and egg-laying sites, are essential for the development of novel, insecticide-free control tools. Selected graminoid plants have been shown to release volatile chemicals attracting malaria vectors; however, whether the attraction is selective to individual plants or more general across genera and families is still unclear. METHODS: To contribute to the current evidence, we implemented bioassays in two-port airflow olfactometers and in large field cages with four live graminoid plant species commonly found associated with malaria vector breeding sites in western Kenya: Cyperus rotundus and C. exaltatus of the Cyperaceae family, and Panicum repens and Cynodon dactylon of the Poaceae family. Additionally, we tested one Poaceae species, Cenchrus setaceus, not usually associated with water. The volatile compounds released in the headspace of the plants were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. RESULTS: All five plants attracted gravid vectors, with the odds of a mosquito orienting towards the choice-chamber with the plant in an olfactometer being 2-5 times higher than when no plant was present. This attraction was maintained when tested with free-flying mosquitoes over a longer distance in large field cages, though at lower strength, with the odds of attracting a female 1.5-2.5 times higher when live plants were present than when only water was present in the trap. Cyperus rotundus, previously implicated in connection with an oviposition attractant, consistently elicited the strongest response from gravid vectors. Volatiles regularly detected were limonene, β-pinene, β-elemene and β-caryophyllene, among other common plant compounds previously described in association with odour-orientation of gravid and unfed malaria vectors. CONCLUSIONS: The present study confirms that gravid Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto use chemical cues released from graminoid plants to orientate. These cues are released from a variety of graminoid plant species in both the Cyperaceae and Poaceae family. Given the general nature of these cues, it appears unlikely that they are exclusively used for the location of suitable oviposition sites. The utilization of these chemical cues for attract-and-kill trapping strategies must be explored under natural conditions to investigate their efficiency when in competition with complex interacting natural cues.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria infection during pregnancy endangers the pregnant woman, fetus, and newborn child. Thus, the use of an insecticide-treated net (ITN) is one of the most frequently advised methods for preventing malaria during pregnancy. Contrary findings have been reported in various studies on ITN utilization among pregnant women in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of ITN utilization and its associated factors among pregnant women in Ethiopia. METHODS: Published articles from PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, AJOL and Cochrane library were systematically searched. All cross-sectional studies on ITN utilization among pregnant women were included in this meta-analysis. To estimate the pooled prevalence and odds ratio, a random-effect model was used; and a subgroup analysis was performed to identify the possible source of heterogeneity. Begg's and Egger's tests were used to identify possible publication bias. RESULTS: Ten cross-sectional studies with 7,161 participants were included. The pooled prevalence of ITN utilization among all pregnant women who had access to ITN in Ethiopia was 59.42% (95% CI 51.14, 67.69). Statistically significant heterogeneity was observed (I(2) = 97.7%; p < 0.0001). Higher educational status (OR = 3.47, 95% CI   2.32, 5.2), pregnant women who had antenatal care visits (OR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.97, 2.65) and having good knowledge of malaria prevention practices (OR = 10.63, 95% CI   5.31, 21.29) were associated with ITN utilization among pregnant women. CONCLUSION: The utilization of ITNs among pregnant women was much lower than the national target. Higher education status, attending ANC and a good level of knowledge were found to be independent predictors of ITN utilization. Improving women's understanding of ITNs will enhance their use, and the government and health sectors should encourage pregnant mothers to enroll in antenatal care.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles arabiensis is the major vector of malaria in Ethiopia. Malaria vector control in Ethiopia is based on selective indoor residual spraying using DDT, distribution of long lasting insecticide treated nets and environmental management of larval breeding habitats. DDT and pyrethroid insecticides are neurotoxins and have a similar mode of action on the sodium ion channel of insects. It was therefore necessary to verify the insecticide susceptibility status of An. arabiensis, to better understand the status of cross-resistance between DDT and the pyrethroids in this species as well as to detect a resistant gene. METHODS: Standard WHO insecticide susceptibility tests were conducted on adults reared from larval and pupal collections from breeding sites at three villages namely: Sodere in the Rift Valley, Gorgora in the north and Ghibe River Valley in the south west of Ethiopia. The occurrence of cross-resistance between pyrethroids and DDT was determined using a DDT selected laboratory colony originally collected from Gorgora. Phenotypically characterized mosquitoes were tested for the presence of knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles using the standard polymerase chain reaction assay. RESULTS: All An. gambiae s.l. specimens assayed by PCR were identified as An. arabiensis. The knockdown and mortality results showed An. arabiensis resistance to DDT in all villages, resistance to deltamethrin and permethrin in the Ghibe River Valley and permethrin resistance in Gorgora. Bioassay susceptibility tests also indicated the presence of cross-resistance between DDT and permethrin, but not between DDT and deltamethrin. The knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation of leucine to phenylalanine in the sodium ion channel gene was detected in populations from Gorgora and the Ghibe River Valley. CONCLUSION: Since An. arabiensis shows high levels of resistance to DDT in all villages tested and varying pyrethroid resistance in Gorgora and the Ghibe River valley, precautionary measures should be taken in future vector control operations. Moreover, the status of resistance in other locations in Ethiopia and the spread of resistant gene (s) should be investigated.

N2  - African maize stem borer, Busseola fusca is an important pest of maize in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigated the relationship between B. fusca population density and yield losses in maize. Twenty four maize farms were visited in 12 localities of southern Ethiopia at three growth stages of maize during 2015 and 2016. Data were collected on percent of infestation, number of larvae and pupae, crop injury variables and grain yield per plant from insecticide protected and not-protected plots. Busseola fusca was present in damaging levels in all the study areas during both years. Infestation, population density and crop injury variables significantly varied between years, growth stage of maize and locations. As altitude increase, levels of infestation, population density, crop injury and grain yield losses increased. Population density of B. fusca was higher at mid-whorl than silking and maturity stages of maize. A single stem borer, B. fusca per plant reduced grain yield by 9.2 g/plant. Similarly, 1 cm tunnel length and one hole per plant reduced grain yield by 1.3 and 4.8 g/plant, respectively. Crop injury and maize grain yield losses significantly lower in protected plot than unprotected. To reduce crop injury and yield losses in maize due to stem borer, farmers especially in higher elevations need to monitor their crop and use effective intervention methods. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - In this study, the concentrations of organochlorine pesticides in thirty (30) randomly collected Tilapia Zilli fish samples from the Baro River, Ethiopia were determined. The pesticide residues were extracted by soxhlet extraction technique using a mixture of n-hexane and acetone. The extracts were cleaned with silica gel and analyzed using a GC-MS. Concentrations of organochlorine pesticides were calculated from linear calibration curves of nine mixtures of standards with a concentration range of 5-200 μg/kg in the fish sample and had correlation coefficients of 0.999 for all concentrations. The ranges of the limit of detections (LODs) and limit of quantifications ( LOQs) were 0.008–0.017 μg/kg and 0.025–0.052 μg/kg respectively. Recovery was determined from spiked samples at concentrations of 5 μg/kg, 60 μg/kg, and 200 μg/kg. Recoveries of 90.87–102.6% were obtained and the method precision calculated from relative standard deviation (RSD) was found to be 1.00–8.62%. Of the thirteen studied organochlorine pesticides five of them were detected in collected fish samples with concentrations of 67.08 μg/kg, 15.35 μg/kg, 16.6 μg/kg, 3.87 μg/kg, and 17.1 μg/kg for Endosulfan II, Endrin, Endosulfan I, 4,4’-DDD, and Chlordane, respectively. The occurrence of organochlorine pesticide residues in fish samples shows that these compounds have been used in the study areas. The levels of chlordane and Endosulfan II detected in fish samples were above the maximum residual limits (MRLs) set by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Therefore public awareness of pesticide use and management needs to be worked on by concerned bodies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Very high (spatial and temporal) resolution satellite (VHRS) and high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provides the opportunity to develop new crop disease detection methods at early growth stages with utility for early warning systems. The capability of multispectral UAV, SkySat and Pleiades imagery as a high throughput phenotyping (HTP) and rapid disease detection tool for wheat rusts is assessed. In a randomized trial with and without fungicide control, six bread wheat varieties with differing rust resistance were monitored using UAV and VHRS. In total, 18 spectral features served as predictors for stem and yellow rust disease progression and associated yield loss. Several spectral features demonstrated strong predictive power for the detection of combined wheat rust diseases and the estimation of varieties' response to disease stress and grain yield. Visible spectral (VIS) bands (Green, Red) were more useful at booting, shifting to VIS-NIR (near-infrared) vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, RVI) at heading. The top-performing spectral features for disease progression and grain yield were the Red band and UAV-derived RVI and NDVI. Our findings provide valuable insight into the upscaling capability of multispectral sensors for disease detection, demonstrating the possibility of upscaling disease detection from plot to regional scales at early growth stages.

N2  - Anemia is a widespread public health problem that affects all stages of life particularly preschool children and pregnant mothers. Anemia among children had significant impact on their growth, development, school performance and mortality. Different strategies like deworming of young children, vitamin A supplementation for children aged 6-59 months, and ferrous sulphate supplementation and provision of insecticide treated bed net for pregnant women were designed to control and prevent anemia. Also, previous studies on anemia factors were conducted but they were not considering the ordered nature of anemia. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the factors of anemia severity levels among children aged 6-59 months in Ethiopia by using ordinal analysis based on Bayesian hierarchical statistical approach. A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey data. A total of 8483 weighted children were included. Due to the ordered nature of the anemia and nested nature of DHS data, ordinal logistic regression model based on hierarchical Bayesian statistical approach was employed to identify the determinants of anemia severity levels. In this study, moderate anemia level was found to be the commonest type which accounts around 29.4%. Female children, poorer, middle, and richest wealth index, primary maternal education and having ANC visit had lower risk of having higher order of anemia. Moderate maternal anemia and stunted children had higher chance of having higher order of anemia. Children age had significant different effect on mild and moderate anemia. Meanwhile, multiple birth/s and deworming had effect on moderate anemia. In addition, normal birth weight had also significant and different effect on mild and severe anemia and history of feverlike illness on mild anemia. The prevalence of anemia among children aged 6-59 months anemia was found to be a severe public health problem. Children age, sex, maternal education, child stunting, history of fever, multiple birth, birth weight, provision of deworming and maternal anemia was found to be the most important factors for child anemia severity levels. Therefore, intervention efforts to control and prevent anemia in Ethiopia requires targeting of these hindering factors.

N2  - Background: Termites are a major insect pest affecting agricultural production and woody materials. They cause severe devastation in the ecosystem, and lead to bare soil. This phenomenon causes the soil to become difficult to plow, which in turn leads to a reduction in the productivity of crops. It can cause 100 % yield losses based on crop types, level of the damage, and size of its populations. To manage this pest, different management options have been evaluated in Ethiopia. While insecticide usage is the dominant option, less attention has been given to Entomopathogenic Nematode (EPN) based management options. Therefore, this research was initiated to screen locally collected EPN isolates and evaluate promising isolates under field conditions on maize crop. Methods: 37 EPN isolates were screened under laboratory condition, while two isolates were evaluated at field condition. The screening of EPN isolates was laid out in a completely randomized design, and the field evaluation used a completely randomized block design, and treatments were replicated thrice. Mortality of insect, damaged root, stem, cob, damage severity, foraging termites, and yield of the crop data were collected. Results: The study indicated that all screened EPN isolates caused mortality on termites under laboratory conditions. The isolates achieved complete mortality of the insect pest within 12 days of exposure. The finding indicated that AEH and S#50 were the more pathogenic and virulent isolates on termites under laboratory conditions and taken to field study. The S#50 isolate was most pathogenic and reduced the infestation and severity of the insect pest on the maize crop under field conditions. Conclusions: This result showed that the entomopathogenic nematode isolates have the potential to manage subterranean termites in the maize field. Future studies should be based on collection of local isolates and develop a full package for the virulent isolates. Copyright: © 2024 Abate Gutema B et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite being preventable, malaria remains an important public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control has plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century. Researchers and policymakers are therefore exploring alternative and supplementary malaria vector control tools. Research in 1900 indicated that modification of houses may be effective in reducing malaria: this is now being revisited, with new research now examining blocking house mosquito entry points or modifying house construction materials to reduce exposure of inhabitants to infectious bites. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), up to 1 November 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/) to identify ongoing trials up to the same date. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, including cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross-over studies, and stepped-wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi-experimental trials, including controlled before-and-after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non-randomized cross-over studies. We only considered studies reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We also summarised qualitative studies conducted alongside included studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in sub-Saharan Africa; three randomized by household, two by village, and one at the community level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with eave closure, roof modification or eave tube installation (a "lure and kill" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In two trials, the interventions were insecticide-based. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. The community implemented the interventions in the sixth trial. At the time of writing the review, two of the six trials had published results, both of which compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. One trial in Ethiopia assessed screening of windows and doors. Another trial in the Gambia assessed full screening (screening of eaves, doors and windows), as well as screening of ceilings only. Screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 1 trial, 184 participants, 219.3 person-years; low-certainty evidence; Ethiopian study). For malaria parasite prevalence, the point estimate, derived from The Gambia study, was smaller (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17; 713 participants, 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence), and showed an effect on anaemia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42, 0.89; 705 participants; 1 trial, moderate-certainty evidence). Screening may reduce the entomological inoculation rate (EIR): both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. In the Gambian trial, there was a mean difference in EIR between the control houses and treatment houses ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 (CIs ranged from -0.46 to 2.41; low-certainty evidence), depending on the study year and treatment arm. The Ethiopian trial reported a mean difference in EIR of 4.57, favouring screening (95% CI 3.81 to 5.33; low-certainty evidence). Pooled analysis of the trials showed that individuals living in fully screened houses were slightly less likely to sleep under a bed net (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 2 trials, 203 participants). In one trial, bed net usage was also lower in individuals living in houses with screened ceilings (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 1 trial, 135 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the two trials published to date, there is some evidence that screening may reduce malaria transmission and malaria infection in people living in the house. The four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base, and we will add these to this review when they become available.

N2  - A literature review is provided on the state of knowledge of the ecology and control of the sand fly vectors of Leishmania donovani in East Africa, with a special emphasis on Phlebotomus orientalis. Visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani is a major health problem in several areas in East Africa. Studies conducted in the past 70 years identified P. orientalis Parrot and P. martini Parrot as the principal vectors of L. donovani in Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya and P. celiae Minter as the secondary vector of the parasite in one focus in Ethiopia. Findings on sand fly fauna and other circumstantial evidence indicate that P. martini is also responsible for transmission of L. donovani in VL endemic foci of Somalia and Uganda. Several studies showed that P. orientalis occupy distinct habitat characterized by black cotton soil and Acacia seyal-Balanites aegyptiaca vegetation, whereas P. martini and P. celiae are associated with termite mounds. Little knowledge exists on effective control measures of sand fly vectors of L. donovani in East Africa. However, recent evidence showed that use of insecticide impregnated bednets and insect repellents may reduce exposure to the bites of P. orientalis. © 2011 The Society for Vector Ecology.

N2  - Objective This study aims to estimate the prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs) and to identify potential risk factors in the Ethiopian context. Study design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Study participants A total of 611 064 participants were included in the review obtained from 42 studies. Methods PubMed (Medline), Embase and Cochrane Library databases in combination with other potential sources of literature were systematically searched, whereby studies conducted between January 2010 and December 2022 were targeted in the review process. All observational studies were included and heterogeneity between studies was verified using Cochrane Q test statistics and I 2 test statistics. Small study effects were checked using Egger's statistical test at a 5% significance level. Result The pooled prevalence of all NTDs per 10 000 births in Ethiopia was 71.48 (95% CI 57.80 to 86.58). The between-study heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 97.49%, p<0.0001). Birth prevalence of spina bifida (33.99 per 10 000) was higher than anencephaly (23.70 per 10 000), and encephalocele (4.22 per 10 000). Unbooked antenatal care (AOR 2.26, 95% CI (1.30 to 3.94)), preconception intake of folic acid (AOR 0.41, 95% CI (0.26 to 0.66)), having chronic medical illness (AOR 2.06, 95% CI (1.42 to 2.99)), drinking alcohol (AOR 2.70, 95% CI (1.89 to 3.85)), smoking cigarette (AOR 2.49, 95% CI (1.51 to 4.11)), chewing khat (AOR 3.30, 95% CI (1.88 to 5.80)), exposure to pesticides (AOR 3.87, 95% CI (2.63 to 5.71)), maternal age ≥35 (AOR 1.90, 95% CI (1.13 to 3.25)), maternal low educational status (AOR 1.60, 95% CI (1.13 to 2.24)), residing in urban areas (AOR 0.75, 95% CI (0.58 to 0.97))and family history of NTDs (AOR 2.51, 95% CI (1.36 to 4.62)) were associated with NTD cases. Conclusion The prevalence of NTDs in Ethiopia is seven times as high as in other Western countries where prevention measures are put in place. Heredity, maternal and environmental factors are associated with a high prevalence of NTDs. Mandatory fortification of staple food with folic acid should be taken as a priority intervention to curb the burden of NTDs. To smoothen and overlook the pace of implementation of mass fortification, screening, and monitoring surveillance systems should be in place along with awareness-raising measures.

N2  - Introduction: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are severe birth defects caused by nutritional, genetic or environmental factors. Because NTDs continue to have a significant health and economic impact on children and community at large, it is crucial to investigate potential risk factors in order to develop novel approaches to NTDs prevention. Determinants for the development of NTDs differ by country, region as well as within the country. The objective of this study was to identify the determinants of NTDs among newborns delivered in three hospitals found in eastern Ethiopia. Methods: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among 138 cases and 138 control women who delivered in three teaching hospitals in Eastern Ethiopia in 2021. Data were collected using a structured and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Cases were mothers who delivered a neonate with any type of NTDs regardless of gestational age or fetal viability, whereas controls were mothers who delivered an apparently healthy newborn. Chi-square was used to assess the significant difference between the two groups. Conditional logistic regression model was used to generate adjusted odds ratio with its corresponding 95% confidence intervals and compare the two groups. Results: Anencephaly (51.4%) and spinal bifida (34.1%) were the most frequently observed NTDs. None of study participants took preconception folic acid supplementation. Being a non-formal mothers (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12–0.92, P = 0.034), rural residence, (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.18–9.78, P = 0.023), history of spontaneous abortion (AOR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.15–7.55, P = 0.023), having severe anemia (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.17–9.87, P = 0.024), history of fever or cold (AOR = 2.75; 95% CI: 1.05–7.15, P = 0.038), and an exposure to various agro-chemicals (AOR = 3.39, 95% CI: 1.11–10.3, P = 0.032) were independent determinants of NTDs. Conclusion and Recommendation: In this study, NTDs were associated to several determinant factors in the area, including residential area, history of spontaneous abortion, severe anemia, fever/cold, antibiotic use before or during early pregnancy, and exposure to agrochemicals. Addressing the identified determinants is critical in averting the incidence of NTDs in the study area. Moreover, more research is needed to investigate women’s dietary practices as well as the practice of preconception folic acid supplementation for pregnant women in Ethiopia’s current health care system. © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - This study aimed to determine residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in tomato and onion samples collected from selected markets in the Jimma zone. A QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) method was used for sample preparation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for OCPs analysis. The method used showed wide linear ranges from 5-50 μg/L for all eight pesticides, with R(2) values ≥ 0.992. The LOD values for the pesticides tested ranged from 0.14 μg/kg for p,p'-DDE to 2.40 μg/kg for p,p-DDT. LOQ values ranged from 0.46 μg/kg for p,p-DDE to 8.32 μg/kg for p,p'-DDT. The recoveries ranged from 74.84 - 109.45 % except for β-BHC (67.82 %). While most of the OCPs in the onion and tomato samples met European Union (EU) and Codex standards, some exceeded the limits. Methoxychlor and p,p'-DDT in onions, and methoxychlor, p,p'-DDT, α-BHC, and δ-BHC in some tomatoes, were detected above the permitted levels. Specific OCPs were not detected in some samples including aldrin in Meki Tomato (Mek-T), γ-chlordane in Agaro Tomato (Ag-T), and p,p'-DDE in Gera Tomato (Ger-T). The residual concentrations of OCPs varied among the samples. Among tomatoes, Gera had the highest percentage of detected OCPs contaminants (37 %), followed by Agaro (34.34 %) and Meki (28.55 %). Similarly, Sire onion (SrO) had the highest percentage of detected OCPs (28 %) compared to Minjer (25.16 %), Shewa Robit (25.10 %), and Sudan onion (22.25 %). In conclusion, most tomato and onion samples analyzed in this study contained OCP residues highlighting the importance of conducting a consumer health risk assessment.

N2  - Background: Minerals are important not only for better plant growth and development but also for human and animal nutrition. It is known that east and west Gojam in the Amhara region and east and west Shoa areas in the Oromia region Ethiopia's most teff growing areas. However, there is no information on the mineral content and nutritional worth of Teff Sire district, Arsi zone, Ethiopia. Since ICP OES is a powerful technique to examine elemental compositions even in lower concentration, it is used in this work to investigate the elemental composition of red teff samples. Methods: The elemental compositions of red Teff grain samples were determined using ICP-OES from three sites: S1, S2, and S3 of Sire district, Arsi zone, Ethiopia. Wet digestion of the teff samples was carried out by weighing 0.5 g red teff sample and digested with 8 ml HNO3 and 2 ml H2O2 (30%) for 3:00 h at a temperature of 100℃ on hot plate. The investigations of method validation, limit of detection and limit of quantification were also carried out. Results: The average amount of elements in red teff sample obtained as 172–280 mg/kg Fe, 13–76 mg/kg Mn, 8.2–8.5 mg/kg Cu, 24–26 mg/kg Zn, and toxic trace elements 0.12–0.29 mg/kg Pb and 0.15–0.22 mg/kg Cd. The limit of detection found in ranges from 0.21 mg Kg−1 to 10.44 mg Kg−1 whereas quantification limit resulted in 0.7 mg Kg−1 to 34.8 mg Kg−1 for the metals under consideration. The method was validated by its linear range in the concentration range of 0.028–1.4 ppm or 0.056–2.8 ppm and excellent recovery result was achieved in the range of 90–120%. Conclusion: This study aimed to investigate the mineral content in red teff cultivated in Ethiopia specifically Arsi zone by using ICP OES. From the obtained results, Iron was the first abundant essential element in red teff compared to Mn, Cu and Zn. The level of trace elements: Cd and Pb in the samples slightly above the acceptable limit, possibly due to agricultural practices like usage of fertilizers, pesticides, and other industrial products. Overall, this red teff elemental composition information contributes to the nutrition database and food safety in Ethiopia and beyond. © 2024 Elsevier GmbH

N2  - Background Maternal exposures to environmental hazards during pregnancy are key determinants of birth outcomes that affect health, cognitive and economic status later in life. In Ethiopia, various epidemiological evidences have suggested associations between environmental exposures such as household air pollution, cigarette smoking, and pesticide exposure and pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm birth, and birth defects. Objective This review aimed at generating summarized evidence on the association between maternal exposure to environmental factors (household air pollution, cigarette smoking, and pesticide) and pregnancy outcomes (birth weight, preterm birth, and birth defects) in Ethiopia. Method A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library databases. All observational study designs were eligible for inclusion in the review. Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality assessment tools adopted for case-control and cross-sectional studies. The random- effects model was applied in computing the pooled estimates and their corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). Funnel and Doi plots were used for detecting the potential publication bias. All statistical analyses were performed using comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA 2.0) and MetaXL version 5.3 software. Result The pooled estimates revealed that prenatal biomass fuel use increased the risk of giving a low birth weight baby by twofold (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.33-3.31), and has no separate kitchen increases the risk of having low birth weight baby nearly by two and half times (OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 1.25-4.92). Overall, using biomass fuel as the main energy source for cooking and /or having no separate kitchen from the main house is 2.37 times more likely to give low birth weight babies (OR = 2.37, 95% CI: 1.58-3.53). Active cigarette smoker women were 4 times (OR = 4.11, 95% CI: 2.82-5.89) more prone to have low birth weight babies than nonsmokers; and passive smoker women were 2.6 times (OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.09-6.35) more risked to give low birth weight babies. It was also estimated that active cigarette smoker women were nearly 4 times (OR = 3.90, 95% CI: 2.36-6.45) more likely to give preterm birth babies. Pesticide exposure during pregnancy also increases the risk of the birth defect 4 times (OR = 4.44, 95% CI: 2.61-7.57) compared with non-exposed pregnant women. Conclusion Household air pollution from biomass fuel use, active and passive cigarette smoking, and pesticide exposures are significantly associated environmental risk factors for low birth weight, preterm birth, and birth defects in Ethiopia. Therefore, Pregnant and lactating women should be aware of these environmental hazards during pregnancy. Promoting clean energy and improved and efficient stoves at the household level will help to reduce household air pollution-related adverse health effects. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

N2  - There is a general drive to reduce pesticide use owing to the potential negative effects of pesticides on the environment and human health. The EU Commission, for example, through its “Farm to Fork Strategy,” has proposed to decrease the use of hazardous chemical pesticides by 50% by 2030. In addition, smallholder farmers in low-income countries do not always follow pesticide safety precautions. This necessitates the introduction of low-risk crop protection strategies also suited for these farmers. Agricultural biologicals can substitute for, or at least partially replace hazardous chemical pesticides. While the market for and use of biologicals is growing quickly in industrialized countries, this practice remains limited in sub-Saharan Africa. To understand the reason behind the low adoption of biologicals, this study examined the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward biologicals among 150 smallholder farmers in the Chole district in Ethiopia. All farmers used chemical pesticides and/or inorganic fertilizers to protect crops, improve yields, and comply with government regulations. The use of biologicals was, however, restricted to one group of biologicals, bio-fertilizers, which approximately 60% of farmers used, and no use of biologicals for plant protection was reported. Even though the understanding of the concept of biologicals was deemed high among respondents, the majority (90%) did not identify biologicals as safer alternatives to conventional agricultural inputs. More than half of the respondents (54%) did not recommend biologicals as safer alternatives to their colleagues. Nevertheless, even if the responding farmers did not perceive biologicals as risk-free, they had a positive attitude towards biologicals when it came to producing healthy food and increasing crop yields and incomes. In comparison to the positive attitude, farmers’ knowledge and practice of biologicals were generally low; thus, efforts are needed to create awareness among farmers. © 2024

N2  - BACKGROUND: Acute poisoning with agrochemicals, medicines and different environmental exposures continues to be a global health problems. However, with our search for reports about acute poisoning, there was no data regarding a change in trends and outcomes of acute poisoning in Ethiopia and its districts. OBJECTIVE: This study was to determine the burden of poison-related health hazards, identify poisoning substances, and clinical outcomes of poisoning cases admitted to Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital- Medical intensive care unit (FHCSH-MICU), Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. METHODS: A retrospective hospital-based study was conducted using patient data archived from March 2019 to February 2020 at FHCSH-MICU. Collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 26 and descriptive statistics such as measures of central tendency and proportions were computed. The results were reported as text narrations, figures and tables. RESULTS: A total 121 poisoned patients were identified from the patient registration log books. Among the total FHCSH-MICU cases registered, acute poisoning accounted for 17.0%. Of 121 poison cases, 118 (98.3%) were due to suicide attempts with the female to male ratio being 1.5:1. The majority, 65 (54.0%), of cases were in the range of 21-30 years age. Nearly two-thirds, 75 (62.0%), of the poisoning cases died, accounting for 21.6% of all deaths in the FHCSH-MICU. The most common poisoning substance was aluminum phosphide, 92 (76%). CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Aluminum phosphide became the leading poisoning substance in the study area. Nearly two-thirds of the poisoning cases died. Hence, aluminum phosphide must be placed in secured and inaccessible places and it should be replaced by less poisonous rodenticides. Health education and awareness creation about this lethal toxin are strongly advisable.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the burden of chemical poisoning and its associated factors at the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) pilot surveillance sites in the Amhara region, Northwest Ethiopia. The analysis of burdens and contributing factors is intended to inform targeted interventions and enhance public health strategies. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at TibebeGhionComprehensive Specialized Hospital(TGCSH) and FelegeHiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital(FHCSH) in the Amhara region of Ethiopia from June to November 2021. Data were collected using structured tools and analyzed with SPSS version 26. Descriptive statistics assessed the burden of chemical poisoning, while Chi-square analysis identified significant factors associated with the burden of chemical poisoning. RESULTS: The study reported a total of 184 chemical poisoning cases at TGCSH and FHCSH in the Amhara region, with a case fatality rate of 17%. The most affected age group was 16 to 25 years, and females accounted for 60% of the cases. Geographic distribution showed that Bahir Dar had the highest incidence, contributing to 64.7% of the cases, while the South Gondar zone, particularly the Fogera district, accounted for 30.88%. Organophosphates emerged as the most prevalent toxic agents, responsible for 53% of the cases. Chi-square analysis highlighted several significant associations with a higher burden of chemical poisoning, including being female (X² = 4.463, p = 0.035), being 35 years or younger (X² = 4.629, p = 0.031), ingestion of rodent poison (X² = 4.154, p = 0.042), intentional poisoning (X² = 7.488, p = 0.006), and inhalation exposure (X² = 4.154, p = 0.042) and educational level (X² = 5.764, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The study reveals a significant burden of chemical poisoning in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia, with a 17% fatality rate, predominantly impacting young adults and females, particularly in areas with high pesticide use, such as Bahir Dar and South Gondar. Key issues include cases with no antidotes, inhalation exposure, and intentional poisoning. RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement stricter chemical regulations, limit pesticide sales, enhance community education on safe handling, and improve mental health support for high-risk groups. Develop sustained CBRN surveillance systems and conduct further research on regional disparities and chemical agent assessments.

N2  - A deltamethrin 'pour-on' insecticide was applied monthly to over 2000 cattle exposed to a high challenge of drug-resistant trypanosomes and high tsetse re-invasion pressure in the Ghibe valley, south-west Ethiopia. Blood samples were taken monthly from an average of 760 cattle for determination of PCV and presence of trypanosomes. The area of the valley is approximately 350 km2 and the cattle grazed in roughly four locations covering about a quarter to half of the area. Two years before the trial commenced, Glossina morsitans submorsitans Newstead (Diptera: Glossinidae) began to invade the valley. Despite the use of the pour-on the mean apparent density of G. m. submorsitans continued to rise, and, during the 4 years of tsetse control, was more than three-fold higher than that recorded during the previous 18 months. Over the same period there was little change in the apparent density of Glossina pallidipes Austen (Diptera: Glossinidae). By contrast, the mean monthly prevalence of trypanosome infections in cattle over 36 months of age decreased from 38.3 to 29.0%, the incidence of new infections decreased from 26.6 to 16.0% (a reduction of 40%), and packed cell volume in cattle increased from 21.7 to 24.1%. Evidence of a change in apparent parasite transmission rate was demonstrated by regression of infection incidence in cattle on the logarithm of apparent density of G. m. submorsitans. Before the trial started the regression coefficient was 45.8 +/- 6.3 and this reduced to 9.2 +/- 2.5% incidence per log(e) (flies/trap/day) during the period of tsetse control. It was concluded that this indicated reductions in tsetse numbers in the immediate vicinities of cattle in a way that was not reflected in overall tsetse catches. Nevertheless, the comparatively high levels of trypanosome prevalence that persisted in the cattle demonstrates that, where invasion prevalence is high, treatment of small pockets of cattle will not eradicate tsetse. To achieve more significant reduction in trypanosome prevalence in cattle, integrated methods of control utilizing target barriers in the major routes of invasion will be needed.

N2  - Background: Asthma is a leading cause of emergency hospital visits and a significant factor in lost productive hours. The lack of a synthesized body of knowledge on bronchial asthma has notable public health implications. Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to investigate the prevalence of asthma and its predictors among patients presenting in Ethiopian public hospitals. Design: Duplicate studies were removed using EndNote version X9. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale guided the quality assessment, and data extraction followed the Joanna Briggs Institute format. Data source and methods: The authors used advanced search methods, including databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Africa Index Medicus, Science Direct, HINARI, Google Scholar, and manual searches. Data presentation adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Publication bias was assessed using Egger’s regression test and a funnel plot. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted. Results: The search yielded 352 original articles, with 22 meeting the criteria for inclusion. Using the random-effects DerSimonian-Laird model, the prevalence of bronchial asthma was found to be 9.02% (95% CI: 7.50, 10.53). Several factors were associated with the prevalence of bronchial asthma, including the spring season (AOR 3.7; 95% CI: 2.11, 6.49), childhood age (AOR 4.2; 95% CI: 1.84, 9.55), and urban residence (AOR 1.7; 95% CI: 1.29, 2.31). Other significant factors include family history of asthma (AOR 2.89; 95% CI: 2.22, 3.75), insecticide exposure (AOR 3.3; 95% CI: 2.23, 4.91), and the presence of household insects like cockroaches (AOR 3.33; 95% CI: 2.15, 5.15). Smoking (AOR 3.64; 95% CI: 2.66, 4.98), obstructive sleep apnea (AOR 4.29; 95% CI: 2.37, 7.76), and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (AOR 4.31; 95% CI: 2.24, 8.32) were also significant. Conclusion: The pooled prevalence of bronchial asthma is notably high in Ethiopia. Key predictors include childhood age, spring season, urban living, family history of asthma, exposure to insecticides, presence of cockroaches, smoking, obstructive sleep apnea, and recurrent upper respiratory infections. Targeted interventions are crucial and should focus on lifestyle improvements, allergen identification, cockroach control, smoking cessation, reducing insecticide exposure, and promoting a safe environment. Trial registration: This review’s protocol was pre-registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO registration number CRD42023491222). © The Author(s), 2024.

N2  - Background: Feeding the world's future population while still facing a variety of socioeconomic and climate change scenarios with uncertain outcomes is a key global societal concern that should be addressed in a science-based manner. Ethiopia boasts a great diversity of wild edible plant species (WEPS), but millions of its citizens still suffer from chronic hunger every year. In this context, we here document the use and conservation of WEPS in the Awi Agäw community, Northwestern Ethiopia. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study from October 2021 to June 2022. Ethnobotanical and conservation status data were collected via semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, field walks and market surveys. A total of 374 respondents from three districts (Guangua, Jawi and Ankasha) were purposely selected for the study. Descriptive statistics, including preference rankings, frequencies and direct matrix rankings, were employed for the data analysis. Results: We identified a total of 39 WEPS plant taxa distributed among 26 families and 32 genera. The Moraceae and Rosaceae had the greatest numbers of plants, with five and three species, respectively. The WEPS are regularly consumed in the study area to alleviate hunger. However, threats such as habitat loss, agricultural expansion, deforestation for firewood and other reasons, and pesticide use threaten WEPS availability. Conclusion: Therefore, community-based conservation interventions need to be encouraged to safeguard WEPS and associated traditional knowledge. Furthermore, nutritional quality analysis is recommended for the selection of promising WEPS candidates. © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Global honeybee losses and colony decline are becoming continuous threat to the apicultural industry, as well as, for food security and environmental stability. Although the putative causes are still unclear, extensive exposure of bees to pesticides could be the possible factor for worldwide colony losses. This study was aimed at evaluating the impact of nine commonly used pesticide incidents on adult worker honeybees (A. mellifera) under the laboratory condition, in North Gonder of Amhara region, Ethiopia. Feeding test, contact test, and fumigation tests were carried out for each pesticide following the standard procedures, and each pesticide toxicity was compared to the standard toxic chemical, dimethoate 40% EC (positive control), and to 50% honey solution (negative control). The results revealed that all the tested pesticides caused significant deaths of the experimental bees (P < 0.05) in all the tests when compared to the negative control. Diazinon 60% EC, endosulfan 35% EC, and malathion 50% EC were appeared highly toxic causing 100% mortality of bees, while chlorsulfuron 75% WG killed 90% of the experimental bees as tested via feeding. On the other hand, agro-2, 4-D and its mixture with glycel 41% EC are moderately toxic, and mancozeb 80% WP and glycel 41% EC were slightly toxic to honeybees as compared to the positive control (dimethoate 40% EC). Suddenly, diazinon 60% EC and malathion 50% EC triggered 100% mortality of bees, while endosulfan 35% EC and chlorsulfuron 75% WG caused 63.63% and 90.82% of bee mortality, respectively, when evaluated via contact test. The fumigation test also showed that chlorsulfuron 75% WG, diazinon 60% EC, and endosulfan 35% EC caused 100%, 86.7%, and 65.6% mortality rate of bees. Our result also highlighted that tested LD(50) of all pesticide incidents were significantly lower than the manufacturer-based LD(50.) This shows that local honeybees A. m. jemenetica are extremely sensitive to commonly used agricultural pesticides, which may affect the colony level due to the intensive application of these pesticides in Ethiopia.

N2  - Pesticides are chemicals used to control different types of pests. Though pesticides played a role in improving the quantity and quality of production, they have been threatening ecosystems and posed effects on humans in different parts of the world. Unfortunately, there were no studies made about the effects of pesticide residues on ecosystems and consumers in the Fogera District of Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Hence, the main objective of this study was to understand the knowledge, attitude, and practices of respondents about the effects of pesticide residues on ecosystems and consumers. A cross-sectional survey complemented by focus group discussions and field observations was used to gather the required data for the study. The close-ended data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, logistic regressions, and independent t-test, and data from open-ended questions were grouped and summarized based on their similarities. The findings of the study confirmed that there was significant knowledge, attitude, and practices difference between farmers and consumers about the effects of pesticide residues on ecosystems and humans. Farmers used highly toxic pesticides to control pests and improve the glossiness of vegetables and khat. Though they didn’t use the sprayed vegetables for their home consumption, some of the farmers deliberately supplied pesticide-sprayed vegetables without worrying about the negative effects of the pesticides on the consumers. There were also fishing practices from rivers after intoxicating the fish using the pesticide sprayed feed. This, in turn, might poison individuals who consume the fish. In general, pesticide application practices and consumption of pesticide-sprayed foodstuffs and surface water might pose serious health risks to ecosystems and humans. To minimize the negative effects of pesticides, rigorous awareness-raising on the effects and management of pesticides, enforcement of laws, delineation of the pesticide free buffer zone for waters, the establishment of a clear pesticide supply chain to the end users, ecosystem assessment and food safety monitoring schemes are highly required. © 2023 Abaineh et al.

N2  - Woody species have been introduced in many parts of the world to provide economic benefits, but some of those species are now among the worst invaders, causing widespread economic and environmental damage. Management of woody species to restore original ecosystem services, such as biodiverse grassland that can provide fodder and sequester carbon, are needed to limit the impacts of alien species. However, the best management methods, i.e., the most economically efficient and effective way to remove trees and the most effective way to restore or rehabilitate the cleared land, are not developed for many species. In Eastern Africa, prosopis (Prosopis julifora) has invaded large areas of savanna and grassland, thereby affecting, among other things, fodder and water for livestock, access to dry season grazing lands and ultimately pastoral livelihoods. We tested three prosopis treatments (manual uprooting and cut stump and basal bark herbicide application) in combination with three incremental restoration interventions (divots, divots + mulching, divots + mulching + grass seed sowing). The three-year study was replicated in Ethiopia (Afar National Regional State), Kenya (Baringo county) and Tanzania (Moshi district). Prosopis survival and vegetation development, both diversity and biomass, were recorded. The prosopis treatments were all highly effective (between 85 and 100% tree mortality in almost all cases), but the two treatments that involved the complete removal of the aboveground biomass (manual and cut stump) yielded a more productive and more diverse vegetation than the treatment that killed the trees standing (basal bark). Compared to the effect of prosopis removal, the effect of restoration interventions on vegetation composition was small, indicating that most species re-established from the soil seed bank. The results show that it is possible to restore land previously invaded by prosopis. Despite the different rates of vegetation establishment and variation in species composition, the restoration interventions resulted in vegetation that in some cases contained a substantial fraction of perennial grasses. The method chosen to control prosopis depends on the availability of resources, including herbicides, and the need to remove rootstocks if the intention is to plant crops. © 2023, The Author(s).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Poison is a substance that can hurt or cause dysfunction in the body due to its chemical action. Poisoning related to pesticides used in agriculture is a major public health issue in developing countries. However, there is a limited epidemiological data on poisoning in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine poisoning patterns, clinical outcome, and factors associated with poisoned patients in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2021 to include data of 1 year period. Data of all poisoned patients were collected using a standardized checklist from the registration book and patient medical records. The association between variables and outcomes was analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered to declare a statistically significant association. RESULT: Over one-third of the poisoning cases (35.9%) were seen in the spring, according to a survey of 315 patient medical data. The majority of patients were in the age group of 21-30 years (44.1%). The most common form of poison consumed was organophosphate (OP), which accounts for 61.3% of all visits, and the least common was food poisoning, which accounts for 1.9%. About 82.5% of poisoning cases survived, while the remaining 17.5% were died. Time of arrival to the hospital ≥1 h (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 7.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 11.40), lack of oxygen support (AOR = 6.64; 95% CI: 3.56-6.78), and lack of adrenaline/dopamine medication (AOR = 3.57; 95% CI: 1.17-5.78) were all substantially linked with death of poisoned cases. CONCLUSIONS: Three-fourth of poisoning cases survived, while the remaining one-fourth died. Ingestion of OPs is the most prevalent type of poisoning, and most cases are intentional. Delayed arrival ≥1 h, lack of oxygen support, and adrenaline/dopamine treatment were all linked to death. On-time arrival, oxygen assistance, and adrenaline/dopamine treatment in a healthcare setting are all recommended.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of resistant strains of malaria vectors to chemical insecticides are becoming major problems for malaria vector management. Natural plant products have a vital role to play in the current challenge of malaria control. The current study was conducted to evaluate insecticidal effect of ethnobotanical plant extracts against the primary malaria vector, Anopheles arabiensis in northwestern Ethiopia. METHODS: Primarily, ethnobotanical plants used for Anopheles mosquito control were surveyed in Dangur district, northwestern Ethiopia. Insecticide-susceptible strains of Anopheles arabiensis mosquito were reared in the insectary of the Tropical and Infectious Diseases Research Centre, Assosa University. After surveying plants used for mosquito control in local people, four frequently used plants were identified for extraction. The larvicidal and adulticidal potential of frequently used plant extracts against susceptible strains of the laboratory colony were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 15 plants were identified as ethnobotanical plants that help local people with mosquito control. Azadirachta indica, Ocimum lamiifolium, Ocimum americanum, Moringa olifeira leaf, and Moringa olifeira seed species of local plants were found to be frequently used to kill and/or repel mosquitoes in the study district. All the plant extracts were found to have potential larvicidal activity against fourth instar larvae of An. arabiensis and only ethanol and methanol extract of Azadirachta indica and Ocimum lamiifolium were found to have potential adulticidal effect against adult of An. arabiensis. The highest larvicidal activity was observed in ethanol extract of Azadirachta indica with 95% larval mortality and lowest Lethal Concentration 50 (LC 50) of 40.73parts per million (ppm) and LC90 of 186.66 ppm. The highest adulticidal activity was observed in methanol extract of Azadirachta indica with 75% adult mortality at 300 ppm and lowest LC50 of 106.65 ppm and LC90 of 1,293 ppm. The lowest larvicidal and adulticidal activity was observed in methanol extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium with 63.35% larval mortality and leaf extract of Moringa olifeira with 50% adult mortality at 300 ppm, respectively. CONCLUSION: Ethanol extract of Azadirachta indica exerted a remarkable larvicidal effect against An. arabiensis and thus it can be used for botanical mosquito insecticide development. Since the current finding is based on susceptible strain of An. arabiensis, further work on wild mosquitoes is recommended.

N2  - In the President's Malaria Initiative (PMI)-funded Africa Indoor Residual Spraying Project (AIRS), end-of-day clean-up operations require the safe disposal of wash water resulting from washing the exterior of spray tanks and spray operators' personal protective equipment. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) programs typically use soak pits - large, in-ground filters - to adsorb, filter and then safely degrade the traces of insecticide found in the wash water. Usually these soak pits are permanent installations serving 30 or more operators, located in a central area that is accessible to multiple spray teams at the end of their workday. However, in remote areas, it is often impractical for teams to return to a central soak pit location for cleanup. To increase operational efficiency and improve environmental compliance, the PMI AIRS Project developed and tested mobile soak pits (MSP) in the laboratory and in field applications in Madagascar, Mali, Senegal, and Ethiopia where the distance between villages can be substantial and the road conditions poor. Laboratory testing confirmed the ability of the easily-assembled MSP to reduce effluent concentrations of two insecticides (Actellic 300-CS and Ficam VC) used by the PMI AIRS Project, and to generate the minimal practicable environmental "footprint" in these remote areas. Field testing in the Mali 2014 IRS campaign demonstrated ease of installation and use, resulted in improved and more consistent standards of clean-up, decreased transportation requirements, improved spray team working conditions, and reduced potential for operator exposure to insecticide.

N2  - In this chapter we concentrate on the status of sediment, sources of siltation, sediment Information, also concentrates on the process of setting up monitoring program for the purpose of providing a valid data base for sediment water quality assessments, and modeling. Also the choice of variables to be measured in the water, the sediment in biota and the common procedures for data handling. This chapter concentrates on the existing process of monitoring programmes for interpretation of these data for the purpose of assessing sediment water quality in rivers, and reservoirs, also focus on monitoring strategies requirements for water quality data and interpretative techniques. The choice of the appropriate methods is illustrated by case studies for typical water pollution situations, beside the strategies for sediment water quality assessment. Within the range of water quality issues addressed in this chapter efforts have been concentrated on major areas of vital importance. Monitoring, analysis is done usually as part of the quality control program for drinking water. It concentrates mainly on (Daily, and monthly base) physical parameters mainly suspended sediment and turbidity. While for sediments transport concentration and load, they adopted stations along the Blue Nile and within Al Gezira scheme only, so establishment of National Monitoring Network for sediment monitoring covering all the Nile system highly recommended. Turbidity and suspended solids imposes the major constrains on the development of surface water for domestic use, where silt content exceeds the designed capacity of the treatment plants and their efficiency drop to almost half, and water contamination risk increases. Also due to continuous deforestation, and erosion in the catchments areas, the turbidity of rivers and seasonal streams increase by up to 50% per decade. The sediment creates many difficulties and problems to Sudan, at the same time, it has its negative impact on the Ethiopian Highlands, from where it originates, and degraded the land by erosion and reducing its productivity. Assessment of River Nile and its tributaries, show that the maximum value recorded of suspended solid load in Blue Nile during the flood season approximately 22 kg/m3. The sediment carried annually by the Nile River was averaging 110 million tons as measured in Aswan. However, since the 90s the average increased to about 40 million tons (HRS, 1996), during the last ten years the maximum sediment concentration increased to about 8500 ppm, (45% sand, 15% silt and 40% clay). The Nile water requires careful management to support sustainable development and avoid excessive abstraction, contamination and environmental degradation. To achieve these objectives it needs proper assessment, control and protection in short and long term perspectives. Establishment of adequate monitoring networks can help in solving these problems by implementation of most efficient tools to delimitation of vulnerable zones to siltation and sedimentation. Several models were developed to assess and quantify the impact of land management on water, sediment, nutrients and pesticides at field scale as well as at small watershed scale. © 2011, IGI Global.

N2  - Anopheles arabiensis Patton (Diptera: Culicidae) is the most widespread vector of malaria in the Afrotropical Region. Because An. arabiensis feeds readily on cattle as well as humans, the insecticide-treatment of cattle--as employed to control tsetse (Diptera: Glossinidae) and ticks (Acari: Ixodidae)--might simultaneously affect the malaria vectorial capacity of this mosquito. Therefore, we conducted field experiments in southern Ethiopia to establish whether Zebu cattle (Bos indicus L.) treated with a pour-on pyrethroid formulation of 1% deltamethrin, widely used to control ticks and tsetse, would be effective against An. arabiensis or cause the female mosquitoes to feed more frequently on humans, due to behavioural avoidance of insecticide-treated cattle. Contact bioassays (3 min exposure) showed that the insecticide remained effective for about 1 month (kill rate > 50%) against mosquitoes feeding on the flanks of treated cattle. A novel behavioural assay demonstrated that An. arabiensis readily fed on insecticide-treated cattle and were not deflected to human hosts in the presence of treated cattle. DNA-fingerprinting of bloodmeals revealed that An. arabiensis naturally feeds most frequently on older animals, consistent with the established practice of applying insecticide only to older cattle, while allowing younger untreated animals to gain immunity against infections transmitted by ticks. These encouraging results were tempered by finding that > 90% of An. arabiensis, An. pharoensis and An. tenebrosus females feed on the legs of cattle, farthest from the site of pour-on application along the animal's back and where the treatment may be least residual due to weathering. Observations of mosquitoes feeding naturally on insecticide-treated cattle showed that the majority of wild female anophelines alighted on the host animal for less than 1 min to feed, with significantly shorter mean duration of feeding bouts on insecticide-treated animals, and the effective life of the insecticide was only 1 week. Thus the monthly application of deltamethrin to cattle, typically used to control tsetse and ticks, is unlikely to be effective against An. arabiensis populations or their vectorial capacity. Even so, it seems likely that far greater impact on anopheline mosquitoes could be achieved by applying insecticide selectively to the legs of cattle.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, malaria infections and other complications during pregnancy contribute to the high burden of maternal morbidity and mortality. Preventive measures are available, however little is known about the factors influencing the uptake of maternal health services and interventions by pregnant women in Ethiopia. METHODS: We analyzed data from a community-based cross-sectional survey conducted in 2016 in three rural districts of Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, with 3784 women who had a pregnancy outcome in the year preceding the survey. We used multivariable logistic regression models accounting for clustering to identify the determinants of antenatal care (ANC) attendance and insecticide-treated net (ITN) ownership and use, and the prevalence and predictors of malaria infection among pregnant women. RESULTS: Eighty-four percent of interviewed women reported receiving at least one ANC visit during their last pregnancy, while 47% reported attending four or more ANC visits. Common reasons for not attending ANC included women's lack of awareness of its importance (48%), distance to health facility (23%) and unavailability of transportation (14%). Important determinants of ANC attendance included higher education level and wealth status, woman's ability to make healthcare decisions, and pregnancy intendedness. An estimated 48% of women reported owning an ITN during their last pregnancy. Of these, 55% reported to have always slept under it during their last pregnancy. Analysis revealed that the odds of owning and using ITNs were respectively 2.07 (95% CI: 1.62-2.63) and 1.73 (95% CI: 1.32-2.27) times higher among women who attended at least one ANC visit. The self-reported prevalence of malaria infection during pregnancy was low (1.4%) across the three districts. We found that young, uneducated, and unemployed women presented higher odds of malaria infection during their last pregnancy. CONCLUSION: ANC and ITN uptake during pregnancy in Jimma Zone fall below the respective targets of 95 and 90% set in the Ethiopian Health Sector Transformation Plan for 2020, suggesting that more intensive programmatic efforts still need to be directed towards improving access to these health services. Reaching ANC non-users and ITN ownership and use as part of ANC services could be emphasized to address these gaps.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Tungiasis is an ectoparasitic infestation, which still has public health importance in deprived populations of developing countries. Data on the prevalence and risk factors of tungiasis is rare in Ethiopia. Hence, this study was designed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of tungiasis among children in Wensho district, southern Ethiopia.
METHODS: From February to May 2016, we conducted a community-based cross-sectional study on 366 children 5-14 years old. Data about the presence and severity of tungiasis were obtained through inspection and data on risk factors were collected through interviews of parents/guardians of the children using structured questionnaire and through observation of the housing environment using structured checklist.
CONCLUSION: Tungiasis is an important public health problem with considerable morbidity among children in Wensho. Hence, implementation of tungiasis prevention strategies such as promoting shoes wearing, provision of health education, fumigating the residential houses and applying insecticides on pets are recommended.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifteen (58.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 53.7%, 63.8%) of the 366 children were infested with Tunga penetrans. Most lesions were localized in the feet and the distribution of the disease by sex was similar (57.4% among males and 60.3% among females). Children of illiterate mothers (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.62, 95% CI: 1.35, 9.73) and children whose mothers have attended only primary education (AOR: 2.72, 95% CI: 1.06, 6.97), children from cat owning households (AOR: 4.95, 95% CI: 1.19, 20.60) and children who occasionally use footwear (AOR: 7.42, 95% CI: 4.29, 12.83) and those who never use footwear (AOR: 12.55, 95% CI: 3.38, 46.58) had a significantly higher odds of tungiasis infestation.

N2  - A survey was conducted in two regional states of Ethiopia, the Amhara National Regional State (ANRS) and the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples Regional State (SNNPRS), to generate information about the cultivation and utilisation of Millettia ferruginea (Hochst) Baker, including use of the plant as livestock feed. Two districts from each Regional State, 4 peasant associations (PAs) from each district and 10 households from each PA were purposively selected based on availability and recognition in the area of M. ferruginea. Data were collected using questionnaire. The period from February to May was reported as critical feed shortage seasons and SNNPRS respondents noted M. ferruginea as a feed resource was used to balance deficits during times of feed shortage. All respondents from SNNPRS and about 41% from ANRS used M. ferruginea as livestock feed. Some respondents from ANRS were however, unaware of the use of M. ferruginea as animal feed. Leaves, flowers and twigs of M. ferruginea were mentioned as edible parts of the plant by cattle, sheep and goats. Feeding M. ferruginea in mixture with other feedstuffs is a common practice in SNNPRS, while the sole M. ferruginea is fed in ANRS. All respondents from SNNPRS had a positive impression on the feeding value of M. ferruginea and indicated improved growth and milk output, no abortion, health problem and deaths of animals was observed due to M. ferruginea feeding. Conversely, the level of understanding of the feeding value of M. ferruginea in ANRS appeared to be low. Other uses of M. ferruginea noted by respondents include use for fishing, firewood, bee foraging, local construction materials and to make household utensils, to improve soil fertility, to provide shade to companion crops, as source of immediate cash income and as pesticide. These and other unmentioned good biological attributes of M. ferruginea therefore, makes it an appropriate choice for its inclusion in agroforestry systems and the tree can contribute to livestock production through provision of feed.

N2  - Background: Countdown to 2015 was a multi-institution consortium tracking progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5. Case studies to explore factors contributing to progress (or lack of progress) in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) were undertaken in: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Niger, Pakistan, Peru, and Tanzania. This paper aims to identify cross-cutting themes on how and why these countries achieved or did not achieve MDG progress. Methods: Applying a standard evaluation framework, analyses of impact, coverage and equity were undertaken, including a mixed methods analysis of how these were influenced by national context and coverage determinants (including health systems, policies and financing). Results: The majority (7/10) of case study countries met MDG-4 with over two-thirds reduction in child mortality, but none met MDG-5a for 75 % reduction in maternal mortality, although six countries achieved >75 % of this target. None achieved MDG-5b regarding reproductive health. Rates of reduction in neonatal mortality were half or less that for post-neonatal child mortality. Coverage increased most for interventions administered at lower levels of the health system (e.g., immunisation, insecticide treated nets), and these experienced substantial political and financial support. These interventions were associated with ~30-40 % of child lives saved in 2012 compared to 2000, in Ethiopia, Malawi, Peru and Tanzania. Intrapartum care for mothers and newborns - which require higher-level health workers, more infrastructure, and increased community engagement - showed variable increases in coverage, and persistent equity gaps. Countries have explored different approaches to address these problems, including shifting interventions to the community setting and tasks to lower-level health workers. Conclusions: These Countdown case studies underline the importance of consistent national investment and global attention for achieving improvements in RMNCH. Interventions with major global investments achieved higher levels of coverage, reduced equity gaps and improvements in associated health outcomes. Given many competing priorities for the Sustainable Development Goals era, it is essential to maintain attention to the unfinished RMNCH agenda, particularly health systems improvements for maternal and neonatal outcomes where progress has been slower, and to invest in data collection for monitoring progress and for rigorous analyses of how progress is achieved in different contexts.

N2  - The issue of Parthenium hysterophorus weed is very important in Ethiopian agriculture. It is spreading rapidly in the highland and lowland areas since its introduction. Currently, most of the regions are invaded by the weed, even the capital city Addis Ababa. There are several factors favoring its rapid distribution in the environment. Its ability to adapt wide range of climatic condition, its allelopathic effect, short life cycle, prolific nature and having large seed bank in the soil environment are among the principal factors. Parthenium has the capacity to decrease the composition and diversity of plant species and it has adverse effects on crop yield, as well as animal and human health. Despite its negative effects, the weed has potential uses such as preparing compost, botanical control of insect pests and bio-herbicide. On the other hand, mechanical control, chemical herbicides, phytochemicals, composting and biological control has been pointed out as an effective management ways and eradication of this weed. There is a need for ecologically balanced management of Parthenium weed aiming to enhance the quality of life for farmers and rural communities, especially in pastoral and agro-pastoral areas of Ethiopia. Hence, the objective of this review was to explore the distribution, harmful and beneficial effects as well as the possible controlling practices against P. hysterophorus.

N2  - Discharge of liquid and solid waste from Jimma town has resulted in a gradual degradation of the quality of the river water feeding the Gilgel Gibe dam, which was constructed for the development of the hydroelectric potential of the Gilgel Gibe River. In general, wastewater is not treated, which makes the use of river water problematic. In addition, the region around the dam mainly consists of farmlands; runoff from the fields results in pollution by pesticides, including DDT. The current situation of waste(water) production in and around Jimma (including the campus of Jimma University) will be discussed, along with the expected impact on the water quality in the Gilgel Gibe reservoir. Possibilities for remediation will be discussed. © 2009.

N2  - Soft tissues of species of marine fauna; crabs (Crustacea), oysters (Pelecypoda, Bivalvia), sea stars (Asterroidea), sea urchin (Echinoidea) and bony fishes (Osteichtyes) sampled along the Kenya-Mombasa coastal region were analyzed to determine the levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Analysis was done using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. This study showed that marine fauna accumulated some OCPs in their tissues, 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane (BHC) being the most common of the OCPs. These findings highlight evidence of pollution of marine fauna at the Kenyan coastal sites. It is necessary to have thorough waste management programs as a strategy to minimize marine pollution. © 2007 Chemical Society of Ethiopia.

N2  - Background:In the northwest of Ethiopia, at the South Gondar region, there was a visceral leishmaniasis (VL) outbreak in 2005, making the disease a public health concern for the regional health authorities ever since. The knowledge on how the population perceives the disease is essential in order to propose successful control strategies.Methodology/Principal findings:Two surveys on VL knowledge, attitudes and practices were conducted at the beginning (May 2009) and at the end (February 2011) of a VL longitudinal study carried out in rural communities of Libo Kemkem and Fogera, two districts of the Amhara Regional State. Results showed that VL global knowledge was very low in the area, and that it improved substantially in the period studied. Specifically, from 2009 to 2011, the frequency of proper knowledge regarding VL signs and symptoms increased from 47% to 71% (p<0.0001), knowledge of VL causes increased from 8% to 25% (p<0.0001), and knowledge on VL protection measures from 16% to 55% (p<0.0001). Moreover, the improvement observed in VL knowledge was more marked among the families with no previous history of VL case. Finally, in 2011 more than 90% of the households owned at least an impregnated bed net and had been sprayed, and attitudes towards these and other protective measures were very positive (over 94% acceptance for all of them).Conclusions/Significance:In 2009 the level of knowledge regarding VL was very low among the rural population of this area, although it improved substantially in the study period, probably due to the contribution of many actors in the area. VL patients and relatives should be appropriately informed and trained as they may act as successful health community agents. VL risk behavioural patterns are subject to change as attitudes towards protective measures were very positive overall. © 2014 López-Perea et al.

N2  - Insect pests, rodents, and microorganisms comprise the larger proportion for the causes of post-harvest loss. The use of insecticidal/pesticidal and insect repellent plants is a deep-rooted tradition and cultural heritage in Ethiopia. This study was conducted to gather information on traditional botanical-based pest control practices by farmers of Farta district, northern Ethiopia. The study identified plants traditionally used as pesticides/insecticides during stacking crops at harvest time. The survey showed farmers are using about 31 species of plants for bottom layering during stacking of their crops. These plants are used as pesticides and insecticides although their level of utilization varied. The most commonly used and effective plant species were Croton macrostachyus Del., Eucalyptus globules Labill., Calpurnia aurea (Ait.) Benth., Vernonia myriantha Hook. f. and Laggera tomentosa (Sch. Bip. ex A.Rich) Oliv. & Hiern, of which C. macrostachyus is the most effective. The insecticidal effect of these botanicals was compared to the synthetic insecticide diazinon (0.1 %). Twelve hours after application of powders of C. macrostachyus, E. globulus, C. aurea and L. tomentosa, the mean mortality rate of termites was equivalent to that caused by diazinon. Further, the insecticidal effect of different parts of C. macrostachyus was compared. Leaves were the most effective. This calls for further identification and adoption of cost-effective and environmental-friendly indigenous/traditional botanical based pest control methods. Identification of active principles from these plants is highly desirable.

N2  - Background: Malaria remains a major public health problem in Ethiopia. Consequently, Ethiopia designed the 2011-2015, Malaria Prevention and Control Strategic Plan to fight the vector. It was discovered that most of the studies conducted on the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) were not in line with the strategic plan of the country. This study aimed to assess ITN ownership and utilization, and includes barriers related to its use among the target-area population at household (HH) level. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional design was employed in Itang for this study. Data were collected by trained nurses through face-to-face interview and observation. A total of 845 participants were selected through multistage sampling, and the size was determined by using a single-population proportion formula. EPI Info and SPSS was used for analysis, and all necessary statistical association was computed in order to explain the outcome variable through explanatory variables of this study. Results: Among 845 HHs interviewed, 81.7% (690) had at least one ITN, while 52.3% (361) had used the ITN the night preceding the data-collection day. HH awareness of malaria prevention, number of ITNs, family size, number of family members sharing sleeping area/beds, sleeping patterns of adolescents, HH-head age, and inconvenience of using ITNs were found to be barriers to the use of ITNs in this study. Conclusion and recommendation: The study concluded that very few HHs owned ITNs and there was very low usage of ITNs. In recommendation, the regional health bureau and district health office should consider bigger nets that can accommodate family members who share the same sleeping area/bed in the area.

N2  - The level of some OCPs in human and cow milk collected from Asendabo, Serbo and Jimma in South-West Ethiopia were analyzed using GC-ECD. Results of the analysis indicated that all samples contained detectable quantities of p,p'-DDT and its metabolites, p,p-DDE and p,p-DDD, but none of the other OCPs analyzed. Mean levels of total DDT in the human and cow milk samples in the three areas were 12.68 and 0.389μgg-1 respectively. The distributions of p,p-DDT, p,p-DDE and p,p-DDD in the human milk samples from the three locations followed the same trend in which the proportion of p,p-DDT was the highest in all the three cases, comprising 55-71% of total DDT, followed by p,p-DDE, 26-39%, and the least, p,p-DDD of 2-5%. The mean ratio of DDT/DDE concentration for the three areas was calculated to be 2.01. This value was much higher than the values reported from other countries in earlier studies and indicates the existence of a higher quantity of DDT from a fresh input in the three study areas. The mean estimated daily intake of DDT by infants from mother's milk in the three locations was found to be 62.17μgkg-1 body weight, which is about three times higher than the acceptable daily intake set by WHO/FAO for total DDT, 20μgkg-1 of body weight. This alarmingly high daily intake value is a cause for concern, since children are highly susceptible to effects from such environmental contaminants. The study has revealed that people in the study areas are facing exposure to DDT from recent use. The observed contamination of mother's milk and the possible transfer of the contaminant from mother to child is an obvious risk associated with breast-feeding in the study areas and possibly in other parts of the country too. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The expansion of pollinator-dependent crops, especially in the developing world, together with reports of worldwide pollinator declines, raises concern of possible yield gaps. Farmers directly reliant on pollination services for food supply often live in regions where our knowledge of pollination services is poor. In a manipulative experiment replicated at 23 sites across an Ethiopian agricultural landscape, we found poor pollination services and severe pollen limitation in a common oil crop. With supplementary pollination, the yield increased on average by 91%. Despite the heterogeneous agricultural matrix, we found a low bee abundance, which may explain poor pollination services. The variation in pollen limitation was unrelated to surrounding forest cover, local bee richness and bee abundance. While practices that commonly increase pollinators (restricted pesticide use, flower strips) are an integral part of the landscape, these elements are apparently insufficient. Management to increase pollination services is therefore in need of urgent investigation.

N2  - Aquatic ecosystems contribute to human well-being by delivering ecosystem services, but their protection has been given low priority in Africa. Lake Ziway in the Ethiopian Rift Valley basin provides services including irrigation, drinking water and fish food in the region. This paper reviews the biological resources and spatio- temporal variation of water quality of the lake focussing on nutrients, metals and pesticides. Lake Ziway is under increasing agricultural and urban pressure and is exhibiting deteriorating trends in several water quality and ecological parameters. Nutrients and trace metals, including PO43−, NO3−, NH4+, Ca2+, Cu and Ni of the lake have shown increasing temporal trends in concentration. Spatially, higher values of major parameters (e.g. NO3−, NH4+, K, Na and electrical conductivity) were observed at shoreline sites near floriculture farming. The water quality of the lake exceeded guideline values for drinking water (alkalinity and Fe) and for aquatic life (NH +, Fe, Cr, Cu and Se). The recently reported pesticides in the lake possibly cause ecological and human health effect. Accordingly, agriculture and urbanisation are affecting water quality of Lake Ziway, with likely negative effects on human health and the lake ecosystem function unless appropriate interventions are taken. Our results may be useful in assessing other African lakes subject to similar anthropogenic pressures in their catchments.

N2  - The white mango scale insect (WMS), Aulacaspis tubercularis Newstead, 1906 is a key pest of mango in Ethiopia, which has been spreading throughout the country since its introduction in 2010. Evaluation of the efficacy of two systemic soil drenching insecticides (thiamethoxam 25 % WG and imidacloprid 35 % SC) independently, and in combination with tree management (pruning) for the control of the WMS was conducted under field conditions in western Ethiopia in two locations in 2018 and 2019. Randomized complete block designs with three replications were used for the experiments. In the first site, all treatments resulted in scale populations that were significantly lower than the control (1086 crawlers and females per leaf). Thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 12 g/tree + pruning resulted in the lowest number of the WMS after the second treatment (43.5 per leaf) followed by thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 18 g/tree + pruning, which was statistically similar. In the second site, imidacloprid 35 % SC + thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 18 g/tree + pruning, resulted in the lowest mean number of the WMS (31.1 per leaf) followed by thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 12 g/tree + pruning (61.4 per leaf). This treatment also gave the highest percentage reduction in number of the WMS compared to the WMS counting before treatment application. This study has shown that use of systemic insecticides and pruning are promising control tactics for the WMS. Cost implications and effects of the insecticides on the natural enemy complex and residual toxicity in fruits need to be evaluated.

N2  - Pesticides are risk factors in human life causing chronic human health effects. They are commonly used across the globe to enhance human endeavors. In Ethiopia, pesticides are widely used by local farmers and governmental organizations for pest control purpose. Pesticide residues in food items have been a concern to the consumers and environment they live in. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the amount of organochlorine and organophosphate pesticide residues in cereal crops in Bench-Sheko Zone, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional laboratory-based study design was employed to determine the amount of pesticide residues. The samples were extracted using a Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) extraction and clean up method. Finally, the extracted samples were injected into gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometer and the types and concentrations of pesticide residues were analyzed. The highest concentration of endosulfan sulfate (0.076 mgkg-1) was detected in rice, followed by dimethoate (0.068 mgkg-1) and p,p′-DDE (0.087 mgkg-1) in sorghum and common millet, respectively, in the samples obtained from the Gurafarda site.The highest concentration of p,p′-DDT (0.133 mgkg-1) was detected in common millet, followed by aldrin (0.082 mgkg-1) and dimethoate (0.077 mgkg-1) in sorghum and common millet, respectively, in the samples obtained from the North Bench site. In addition, aldrin detected in rice, sorghum, and common millet obtained from the three sites was a residue of above the maximum residual limits set by Codex Alimentarius regulations and European Union. The finding shows that an indication of the widespread use of pesticides in cereal crops.

N2  - Faba bean is the most important food legume crop; however, its productivity is threatened by faba bean gall (FBG) disease. Faba bean gall is an emerging and destructive disease in the highlands of Ethiopia. Field experiments were conducted on farmers’ field during the 2018 and 2019 cropping seasons in Bassona Worana district, Ethiopia under natural conditions to estimate yield losses on local cultivar and improved faba bean varieties and to determine fungicides spray schedules. The experiments consisted of two moderately tolerant (Degaga and Gora) faba bean varieties and one susceptible local cultivar, two fungicides [Bayleton 25 WP (Triadimefon 250 g kg−1) and Ridomil Gold MZ 68 WG (Metalaxyl 40 + Mancozeb 640 g kg−1)] and two application schedules (10 and 15 days). The treatments were arranged in randomized complete block design with three replications in factorial combinations. The results showed that use of different faba bean genotypes and applications of fungicides significantly (P < 0.001) reduced FBG disease epidemics and minimized grain yield loss. Variety Gora sprayed with Bayleton at 10 days interval recorded low mean FBG disease severity (26.7 and 13.0%) and AUDPC of 1866.7 and 751.7%-days in 2018 and 2019, respectively. High mean grain yields of 3.7 t ha−1 (2018) and 5.0 t ha−1 (2019) were also obtained from variety Gora sprayed with Bayleton at 10 days interval. High grain yield losses of 62.5% (Degaga), 54.1% (local cultivar) and 50.0% (Gora) were obtained from unsprayed plots of each genotype. Conversely, faba bean genotypes obtained yield increases of 166.4% (Degaga), 100% (Gora) and 121.3% (local cultivar) when treated with Bayleton at 10 days interval in 2018. Similar trends were observed regarding 100-seed weight (HSW) loss and in 2019. Moreover, unsprayed plots of each genotype recorded the highest disease severity and AUDPC and the lowest grain yield in both cropping years. On the other hand, faba bean grain yield and yield components demonstrated an inverse relationship with disease severity. Hence, use of tolerant faba bean varieties like Gora and application Bayleton at a rate of 0.7 kg ha−1 at 10 days interval is essential to manage FBG disease, thereby minimizing yield and HSW losses of faba bean in the study areas.

N2  - Introduction: insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) stood at center in the current efforts to prevent and control malaria at community and individual levels. Though ITNs are the most prominent measure for large-scale deployment in highly endemic areas their compliance in terms of ownership and usage needs attention. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the ownership and utilization pattern of ITNs in Harari Peoples National Regional state, Ethiopia. Methods: a community based cross-sectional study was conducted in Harari National Regional State from September to October, 2012. A total of 784 households were included from malarious areas. Data were collected by using structured questionnaires and observational checklist. Results: about 57.9% of participants had at least one ITNs. The utilization of ITNs based on history of sleeping under net in the previous night was 73.3%. Regarding proper use of ITNs, 57.9% of respondents demonstrated proper hanging and tucking. Those households with secondary school education (AOR: 1.775(1.047, 3.009)), knowledge about ITNs use (AOR: 2.400(1.593, 3.615)) and knowledge of malaria transmission by bite of mosquito (AOR: 1.653(1.156, 2.365)) have more likely hood to own ITNs. Conclusion: ITNs Ownership was low as compared to the target by Federal ministry of Health of Ethiopia. Though utilization of ITNs was promising, there are still significant number of participants who demonstrate hanging and tucking improperly. Therefore, health bureau need to work towards increasing the distribution of ITNs per household and also provide health information through health extension workers to enhance regular and proper usage of the ITNs.

The khat samples from Galemso and Aseno had p,p′-DDT concentrations ranged from 141.2 to 973.0 μg/Kg and 194.3-999.0 μg/Kg, respectively. Diazinon was detected in all the khat samples from BadaBuna (173.9-686.9 μg/Kg) but not in any of the samples from Galemso and Aseno. Diazinon was detected in all the wheat samples obtained from both Arsi and Bale (125.8 and 125.6 μg/Kg, respectively) and aldrin levels in these samples were below the quantification limit. Khat may be a contributing factor in the pathological diseases found among khat users. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Khat, a leafy bush whose leaves are chewed for a mild amphetamine effect, has been chewed in Ethiopia, Yemen, and Kenya for centuries in ritual and social contexts. In the last century, khat chewing has become more widespread in Africa as well as in the global north following the diaspora from Yemen and the Horn of Africa. In places where it is grown (primarily Kenya, Ethiopia, and Yemen, but also in Madagascar), it is the life's blood of local economies and, in some places, critical to the national economy, despite uneven legal status and sometimes strong public condemnation of the substance. This chapter provides an overview of the effects of khat on environment and health in the countries where it is produced and consumed, including original research conducted in Madagascar, where it was introduced during the French colonial era by dock workers from Yemen in the early twentieth century. The chapter argues that Khat has had mixed effects. On the one hand, khat production is linked to overuse of water, negative health effects of pesticides, and the supply of a substance whose purchase poor households can ill-afford. On the other hand, khat provides a significant income for farmers and traders. The chapter takes political ecology of health approach, which evaluates consumption, distribution, and production in the context of the broader political, economic, environmental, and health concerns.

N2  - Faba bean is an important pulse crop in area coverage and volume of annual production in Ethiopia. However, the productivity is still far below its potential mainly due to the emerging faba bean gall disease. This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate and demonstrate the integrated disease management options of using a combination of Noble 25 WP fungicide and moderately disease-resistant varieties. The treatment arrangement was designed as an un-replicated simple block considering farmers as replications. Foliar application of Noble 25 WP fungicide was used at a rate of 1 kg ha−1 using 400 l ha−1 water. The agronomic, economic, and farmer preference data were collected and analyzed in descriptive statistics. The result revealed that the highest grain yield of 3.96 tons ha−1 was obtained from a sprayed plot of Gora variety and had an overall yield advantage of 130.8% over farmers’ unsprayed local variety under the existing practice. Besides, the highest final faba bean gall disease percent severity of 45.6% was recorded from the unsprayed control plots. Using a combination of Gora improved variety with foliar application of the fungicide reduced the severity of the disease by 59.3% compared with that of the sprayed local variety. Similarly based on the partial budget analysis result, the highest (783.8%) marginal rate of return was obtained from the use of Gora variety with three times sprays of Noble 25 WP. The results of this study suggested that the proper application of fungicides combined with improved varieties is important for the economic management of faba bean gall disease.

N2  - Field pea is an important pulse crop that plays a key role in human and animal nutrition as well as for soil fertility in many cropping systems. In East Africa, the pea weevil, Bruchus pisorum L. (Coleoptera: Bruchidae), is one of the main biotic production constraints causing considerable loss both in the field and during storage. The storage loss level depends on the number of weevils remaining in the seed after harvest and on the storage facilities and practices of the farmers. To address the storage losses, we evaluated the effectiveness of hermetic triple-layer Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags, on stored grain quality and control of pea weevil infestation in Ethiopia. The PICS bag and two currently used farmers’ storage practices: polypropylene bag (PP) and polyethylene bag with Actellic dust (PE) were compared. Each bag was filled with 50 kg of field peas, and stored for 5 months. Fewer live adult pea weevils and lower percent grain damage was recorded in PICS and PE bags compared to PP bags along the storage period. Field pea grains stored in PICS bags and PE bag also retained higher germination capacity as compared to those stored in a PP bag. The proximate composition differed significantly between storage treatments during the trial. Grain stored in PICS bag and PE bag with Actellic dust showed higher grain moisture, crude protein, and crude fat content, but less total carbohydrate and ash content as compared with grain stored in PP bag. We concluded that PICS bags can be used by smallholder field pea growers to maintain grain quality postharvest, remove the need to use pesticides on their stored peas, and reduce pea weevil damage.

N2  - Background. There are frequent reports of unsafe pesticide use in many parts of Africa. Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa with around 80% of the population still depending on agriculture which intensively uses pesticides. A number of studies have examined pesticide-related health and environmental risks in Ethiopia. However, most of these studies have been small in scale and it is therefore challenging to get a general overview of the extent of health risks and level of environmental contamination in the country. Objectives. The aim of the present study was to synthesize and summarize contemporary knowledge on pesticide-related risks and relevant gaps in Ethiopia. Methods. An electronic database search and gathering of grey literature were done to collect information on the risks of pesticide use in Ethiopia. The electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed) without any publication date or language specifications. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used as guide in the creation of this review. Discussion. A synthesis of the reviewed studies showed evidence of health risks due to occupational pesticide exposure, surface water pollution with pesticides that could cause chronic health risks to the public, evidence of pesticide contamination of the environment (e.g., soil organisms, fish, bee colonies and wildlife) and local as well as international consumer risks due to pesticide residues in food items. In addition, there have been frequent reports of health and environmental hazards in association with cut-flower farms. There is also evidence of direct use of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on food crops and detection of DDT residues in surface water, soil and human breast milk. Those reported risks might be due to lack of knowledge among farm workers, negligence of farm owners, absence of post-registration monitoring systems and poor implementation of both national and international regulations in Ethiopia due to poor institutional capacity. Conclusions. The health and environmental risks of inappropriate use of pesticides requires action by all concerned bodies. Improved institutional arrangements for enforcement of regulations, awareness and further intervention studies could lessen the high risks of pesticide misuse. Competing Interests.

N2  - Background: The movement of malaria vectors into new areas is a growing concern in the efforts to control malaria. The recent report of Anopheles stephensi in eastern Ethiopia has raised the necessity to understand the insecticide resistance status of the vector in the region to better inform vector-based interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate insecticide resistance in An. stephensi in eastern Ethiopia using two approaches: (1) World Health Organization (WHO) bioassay tests in An. stephensi; and (2) genetic analysis of insecticide resistance genes in An. stephensi in eastern Ethiopia. Methods: Mosquito larvae and pupae were collected from Kebri Dehar. Insecticide susceptibility of An. stephensi was tested with malathion 5%, bendiocarb 0.1%, propoxur 0.1%, deltamethrin 0.05%, permethrin 0.75%, pirimiphos-methyl 0.25% and DDT 4%, according to WHO standard protocols. In this study, the knockdown resistance locus (kdr) in the voltage gated sodium channel (vgsc) and ace1R locus in the acetylcholinesterase gene (ace-1) were analysed in An. stephensi. Results: All An. stephensi samples were resistant to carbamates, with mortality rates of 23% and 21% for bendiocarb and propoxur, respectively. Adult An. stephensi was also resistant to pyrethroid insecticides with mortality rates 67% for deltamethrin and 53% for permethrin. Resistance to DDT and malathion was detected in An. stephensi with mortality rates of 32% as well as An. stephensi was resistance to pirimiphos-methyl with mortality rates 14%. Analysis of the insecticide resistance loci revealed the absence of kdr L1014F and L1014S mutations and the ace1R G119S mutation. Conclusion: Overall, these findings support that An. stephensi is resistant to several classes of insecticides, most notably pyrethroids. However, the absence of the kdr L1014 gene may suggest non-target site resistance mechanisms. Continuous insecticide resistance monitoring should be carried out in the region to confirm the documented resistance and exploring mechanisms conferring resistance in An. stephensi in Ethiopia.

N2  - This study was initiated to analyze smallholder farmers’ vulnerability to climate change-induced shocks and identify the adaptation strategies they practice. The study was conducted in the North Wollo and Wag Hemra zones of the Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. It employed both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection. The zones and districts were selected purposively based on the frequency of shocks and the sample Kebeles1 and sample respondents were selected randomly. Quantitative data were collected using a household survey, whereas qualitative data were collected via focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observations. While the quantitative data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, the qualitative data were transcribed, coded, organized thematically based on these similarities, and interpreted thematically. The results show that the major climate change-induced shocks in the area were increase in temperature and changes in rainfall-related variables, such as shifts in rainy periods, shortages of rain, and variability of rainfall. In addition, droughts, crop and livestock pests and diseases, and pasture and water scarcity are all widespread in the area. As a result, land degradation and reduced crop and livestock output were identified as the primary impacts due to climate change-induced shocks on smallholder livelihoods. The findings demonstrate that households and communities are extremely vulnerable to climate change-related shocks. To reduce their vulnerability to climate change, smallholder farmers in the area used both autonomous and policy-driven climate change adaptation strategies, such as soil and water conservation practices, haystack preparation, improved crop varieties, fertilizer, pesticide, and herbicide application. Nonetheless, smallholder farmers' vulnerability to climate change-induced shocks persists, owing to the limitations in the implementation of existing adaptation strategies in the area. Limited access to finance, information, and technologies have all been an obstacle in the sector, preventing comprehensive adaptation to climate change. As a result, smallholder farmers' capacity to adopt both autonomous and policy-driven climate change adaptation strategies must be strengthened. Hence use of improved crop and livestock varieties, application of good agricultural practices, construction of micro-and small-scale irrigation structures, and provision of well-coordinated early warning systems are examples of adaptation strategies that could be implemented to reduce vulnerability to climate change-induced shocks and increase farmers' adaptive capacity.

N2  - The levels of 30 selected pesticides and trophic biomagnification of DDT were investigated in biota samples of the Lake Ziway in the Rift valley region, Ethiopia. Carbon source and trophic position were calculated by using 13C and 15N stable isotopes, individually, and trophic magnification factors (TMFs) were inferred. Only DDT and its metabolites were quantified in all samples analyzed. The most prominent metabolite was p,pʹ-DDE with mean concentration ranging from the 0.82–33.69 ng g−1 lipid weight. Moreover, the ratio of DDT/DDD + DDE in all the biota samples was less than 1 signifying historical DDT application. Regression of log [ΣDDT] vs TL (trophic level) among all biota species showed a significant correlation, indicating that DDTs are biomagnifying along with the food web of Lake Ziway with an estimated TMF of 2.75. The concentrations of DDTs and other organochlorine pesticides found in biota from Lake Ziway were, in general, lower than studies found in previous studies carried out in the same lake.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Reliance on fungicides to manage disease creates selection pressure for the evolution of resistance in fungal and oomycete pathogens. Rust fungi (Pucciniales) are major pathogens of cereals and other crops and have been classified as low-risk for developing resistance to fungicides; no case of field failure of fungicides in a cereal rust disease has yet been recorded. Recently, the Asian soybean rust pathogen, Phakopsora pachyrhizi evolved resistance to several fungicide classes, prompting us to screen a large sample of the globally widespread wheat yellow rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), for mutations associated with fungicide resistance. RESULTS: We evaluated 363 Pst isolates from Europe, the USA, Ethiopia, Chile, China and New Zealand for mutations in the target genes of demethylase inhibitor (DMI; Cyp51) and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI; SdhB, SdhC and SdhD) fungicides. A high proportion of Pst isolates carrying a Y134F DMI resistance-associated substitution in the Cyp51 gene was found among those from China and New Zealand. A set of geographically diverse Pst isolates was also found to display a substitution in SdhC (I85V) that is homologous to that reported recently in P. pachyrhizi and linked to SDHI resistance. CONCLUSION: The identification of resistance-associated alleles confirms that cereal rusts are not immune to fungicide resistance and that selection for resistance evolution is operating at high levels in certain locations. It highlights the need to adopt fungicide resistance management practices and to monitor cereal rust species for development of resistance. © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - The QuEChERS method developed for 22 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and 7-polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fish tissue involves a simple and efficient freezing technique for removal of lipids. The equipment developed consists of disposable syringes and a freezing block constructed from simple materials found in most laboratories. The freezing block keeps the temperature in the extract at -20.5°C up to 10min after being exposed to room temperature. After the freezing step 69% of the lipids in tilapia and 61% in salmon are removed. Further reduction of co-extractives up to 96% in tilapia and 87% in salmon can be made by treatment with CaCl 2 and primary secondary amino sorbent (PSA) which removes the fatty acids. Spiking experiments in tilapia at 5 and 50ng/g and extracted with acetonitrile show recovery range from 70 to 115% for all compounds. In salmon the recoveries are in the range 43-118% for the OCPs and 26-65% for the PCBs. Analysis of a standard reference material shows acceptable results for most of the pesticides but low results for the PCBs. The estimated LOQs were in the range 1-5ng/g for tilapia and 2-10ng/g for salmon. The method has been applied to analyse fish samples from Lake Koka in Ethiopia. It was investigated if addition of a less polar water miscible solvent than acetonitrile could increase the recovery of OCPs and PCBs. The results show that a mixture of 75% acetonitrile and 25% tetrahydrofurane (ACN/THF 75/25) clearly enhances the recoveries for most OCPs (47-101%) and PCBs (42-79%) from salmon. The recovery of aldrin increases significantly from 55% to over 80%. The method using ACN/THF 75/25 is applicable to the extraction of OCPs and PCBs from fish tissue having a lipid content of up to about 11% (salmon) with recoveries ≥70% for most of the OCPs and ≥42% for the PCBs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Pesticide applications and the proximity of land use to water matrices have resulted in discharges of pollutants including Malathion —one of the most widely used organophosphorus pesticides— to water resources such as marine, freshwater, and under groundwater. Exposure to malathion through consumption of contaminated water may cause deleterious health effects on consumers. Determining the amount of pesticides used on farms can play an important role in preventing potential toxicity and pollution of nearby aquatic ecosystems. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis is focused on evaluating the concentrations of Malathion in water resources while considering probabilistic health risk assessment. The international databases of Scopus, Embase, and PubMed were investigated to evaluate the related articles from January 01, 1968 to March 25, 2021. Thirty-four articles containing 206 samples from 15 countries were included. A meta-analysis of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risk assessments for Malathion was also performed. To determine uncertainty intervals, a Monte-Carlo simulation was conducted. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the rankings of Malathion pollution (from the most to the least) were: drinking water > surface waters > groundwaters. Moreover, the results of the risk assessments confirm that there is no non-carcinogenic risk for any of the study areas. The carcinogenic risk assessment was within the limit for the countries under this study, except for Ethiopia that was slightly over the limit as well as Iran, and Mexico had high carcinogenic risk.

N2  - Background: Tuta absoluta Meyrick 1917 (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is an invasive, pesticide resistant, and a major treat of tomato production in the world. It needs effective management options that naturally infect the insect without causing any identified side effects. Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) are the most important options. However, geographic origin and climatic condition apparently creates genetic variation among EPF strains that influence on their pathogenicity. Thus, screening of effective EPF strains from the local source is vital to develop environmental friendly pest control tactic for T. absoluta. Results: In this study, 27 indigenous Beauveria were isolated from the various types of soil and 12 of the isolates were screened based on their biological efficiency index (BEI). These isolates scored 65.7–95.7% and 68.3–95% of mortality against second and third instar larvae of T. absoluta at concentration of 1 × 107spores·ml-1 in 7 days post inoculation, respectively. Out of these, five (18.5%) isolates scored above 90% mortality on both instar larvae with LT50 value of 3.33 to 5.33 days at the lowest (104 spores·ml-1) and 1.93 to 3.17 days at highest (108 spores·ml-1) spore concentrations and has LC50 value of 1.5 × 103 to 1.1× 105 spores·ml-1. Moreover, isolates exhibited the promising mortality better (1.5 × 106 to 3.5 × 107 spores·ml-1), sporulated over the larval cadavers, well grown at optimal temperature, and produced chitinolytic enzymes. Molecular analysis showed that isolates have nearly monophyletic characters and grouped under species of Beauveria bassiana. Conclusion: Different types of soil in Ethiopia are an important source of B. bassiana, and these isolates showed promising pathogenicity against T. absoluta, which is crucial for ecofriendly biopesticide development. Although isolates were nearly monophyletic in phylogenetic study, five of them were highly effective in the laboratory bioassays against T. absoluta; however, further field evaluation is required for mass production.

N2  - Crops are variously susceptible to biotic stresses–something expected to increase under climate change. In the case of staple crops, this potentially undermines household and national food security. We examine recent wheat rust epidemics and smallholders’ coping mechanisms in Ethiopia as a case study. Wheat is a major food crop in Ethiopia widely grown by smallholders. In 2010/11 a yellow rust epidemic affected over one-third of the national wheat area. Two waves of nationally representative household level panel data collected for the preceding wheat season (2009/10) and three years after (2013/14) the occurrence of the epidemic allow us to analyze the different coping mechanisms farmers used in response. Apart from using fungicides as ex-post coping mechanism, increasing wheat area under yellow rust resistant varieties, increasing diversity of wheat varieties grown, or a combination of these strategies were the main ex-ante coping mechanisms farmers had taken in reducing the potential effects of rust re-occurrence. Large-scale dis-adoption of highly susceptible varieties and replacement with new, rust resistant varieties was observed subsequent to the 2010/11 epidemic. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify the key factors associated with smallholder ex-ante coping strategies. Household characteristics, level of specialization in wheat and access to improved wheat seed were the major factors that explained observed choices. There was 29–41% yield advantage in increasing wheat area to the new, resistant varieties even under normal seasons with minimum rust occurrence in the field. Continuous varietal development in responding to emerging new rust races and supporting the deployment of newly released resistant varieties could help smallholders in dealing with rust challenges and maintaining improved yields in the rust-prone environments of Ethiopia. Given the global importance of both wheat and yellow rust and climate change dynamics study findings have relevance to other regions.

N2  - Arguably, integrated pest management (IPM) systems in the developed world are already well-structured not only around insect control for feed and food crops but also for minimizing postharvest losses due to pest attacks. As such, those who would use IPM approaches will typically have easy access to critical IPM knowledge in their own languages, have access to reliable and highly regulated control approaches, and can readily find or create tools and resources to deploy and maintain those IPM strategies. Such IPM strategies also frequently have direct or indirect institutional support from relatively well-funded public and/or private organizations (e.g., extension services, or manufacturing companies for pesticides or biological control agents). In the developing world, in contrast, the exact opposite is often the case. There, getting IPM information to farmers and to critical others along the value chain of particular food and feed commodities is profoundly challenging. There is often little institutional support, which is frequently underfunded in any case, while accessing and delivering critical knowledge is made extremely challenging by a large number of languages - e.g., 50-70 languages or dialects respectively in Ghana and Ethiopia. Additionally, many farmers in these countries are often low- or non-print literate learners who live in remote rural areas - two more factors that make delivering needed IPM knowledge a significant challenge. In 2011, we launched “Scientific Animations Without Borders” (SAWBO), a university-based program scientifically researching and addressing how to deliver community-and life-changing IPM strategies around topics such as food security, health issues, and women’s empowerment to low-to non-print literate farmers in developing world contexts. The most visible work products of this project are scientifically accurate educational animations that can be overdubbed into local languages as needed and displayed on information and communication (ICT) devices (e.g., projectors, tablets, laptops, TVs, but, most importantly, on cell phones) in order to deliver information on a given concept or idea to local people in their own language. SAWBO creates these animated videos by iteratively working in a four-step (internally peer-reviewed and member-checked) process with global and local knowledge experts to develop a best-practices visualization that addresses various developing world issues around IPM, agriculture, health, women’s empowerment. Transforming participant learners into participant educators is a key point for IPM scalability. Here, the limit or barrier is largely technological, i.e., that cell phone coverage, availability, and data plan affordability are not yet total in Africa. Fortunately, this technological barrier is rapidly eroding, but these barriers can also be cultural, not only with respect to changing perceptions of cell phone use solely for communication but also in gendered differences of access, use, and safety for women. This is critical, given the pivotal role of women in the postharvest value-chain of legumes such as cowpea. As such, SAWBO continues to create new IPM content as it enters a new phase of training trainers in the use of the SAWBO Deployer App as a way to facilitate use of its IPM animated videos in local educational programs, especially those working on IPM for cropping systems in Africa.

N2  - The concentrations and bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) were determined in four fish species from Lake Koka, Ethiopia, representing 2-3 levels in the food chain of the lake. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), endosulfans, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorpyrifos were identified, with DDTs as the most predominant pesticide, with concentration ranging from 0.05 to 72.53ngg -1 wet weight (ww). All fish tissue samples collected from different species of the lake contained residues of DDTs. The maximum level of DDTs was found in the fattiest, African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus) sampled from the lake, with a mean concentration of 15.15ngg -1ww. The significant (P<0.05) relationship between concentrations of DDTs and δ 15N indicates that DDTs biomagnified in the food web of the lake. The 4,4'-DDE to 4,4'-DDT ratio in Oreochromis niloticus (0.6) and Cyprinus carpio (0.5) were below 1, indicating ongoing use of DDTs in the study area and recent exposure of these fish species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The establishment and strengthening of poisons centres was identified as a regional priority at the first African regional meeting on the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM) in June 2006. At this meeting, the possibility of a subregional poisons centre, that is, a centre in one country serving multiple countries, was suggested. The WHO Headquarters following consultation with counterparts at the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and the SAICM Africa Regional Focal Point successfully submitted a proposal to the SAICM Quick Start Programme (QSP) Trust Fund Committee for a feasibility study into a subregional poisons centre in the Eastern Africa subregion. However, before such a study could be conducted it was deemed necessary to carry out a literature review on the patterns and epidemiology of poisoning in this region so as to inform the feasibility study. The current paper presents the results of this literature review. The literature search was done in the months of June and July 2012 by two independent reviewers with no language or publication date restrictions using defined search terms on PUBMED. After screening, the eventual selection of articles for review and inclusion in this study was done by a third reviewer.

N2  - A selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) procedure capable of performing simultaneous extraction and clean-up has been demonstrated for multi-residue analysis of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in soil. The final method was performed at 100 °C for 3 × 10 min using acetone/n-heptane (1:1, v/v). Florisil was placed inside the extraction cell downstream the sample to remove interfering compounds. Extraction of two soil samples by SPLE gave a recovery which was over 80% for β-endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate, p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDE compared to PLE with off-line clean-up. The same trend was observed when applying the SPLE method to a certified reference soil sample (CRM 811-050) containing 13 OCPs, where the SPLE method gave 80-90% recovery vis-à-vis the PLE method with off-line clean-up. Feasibility of the SPLE method was further demonstrated by applying it to five real soil samples collected in Ethiopia. © 2007.

N2  - The present study investigated the presence and level of pesticide residues in wheat and khat samples collected from various localities of Ethiopia. The khat samples from Galemso and Aseno had p,p′-DDT concentrations ranged from 141.2 to 973.0 μg/Kg and 194.3-999.0 μg/Kg, respectively. Diazinon was detected in all the khat samples from BadaBuna (173.9-686.9 μg/Kg) but not in any of the samples from Galemso and Aseno. Diazinon was detected in all the wheat samples obtained from both Arsi and Bale (125.8 and 125.6 μg/Kg, respectively) and aldrin levels in these samples were below the quantification limit. Khat may be a contributing factor in the pathological diseases found among khat users. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

N2  - Pesticides are risk factors in human life causing chronic human health effects. They are commonly used across the globe to enhance human endeavors. In Ethiopia, pesticides are widely used by local farmers and governmental organizations for pest control purpose. Pesticide residues in food items have been a concern to the consumers and environment they live in. Therefore, this study was aimed at determining the amount of organochlorine and organophosphate pesticide residues in cereal crops in Bench-Sheko Zone, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional laboratory-based study design was employed to determine the amount of pesticide residues. The samples were extracted using a Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) extraction and clean up method. Finally, the extracted samples were injected into gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometer and the types and concentrations of pesticide residues were analyzed. The highest concentration of endosulfan sulfate (0.076 mgkg-1) was detected in rice, followed by dimethoate (0.068 mgkg-1) and p,p′-DDE (0.087 mgkg-1) in sorghum and common millet, respectively, in the samples obtained from the Gurafarda site.The highest concentration of p,p′-DDT (0.133 mgkg-1) was detected in common millet, followed by aldrin (0.082 mgkg-1) and dimethoate (0.077 mgkg-1) in sorghum and common millet, respectively, in the samples obtained from the North Bench site. In addition, aldrin detected in rice, sorghum, and common millet obtained from the three sites was a residue of above the maximum residual limits set by Codex Alimentarius regulations and European Union. The finding shows that an indication of the widespread use of pesticides in cereal crops.

N2  - Background: Pesticide use in Ethiopia has become a common practice in which large-scale flower farms are the main consumers. Workers on flower farms might be exposed to pesticides while spraying or while performing other tasks related to pesticide use and management. It is unclear whether working as a flower farm sprayer is associated with respiratory health problems. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare respiratory symptoms and lung function indices between pesticide sprayers and non-spraying workers. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 15 flower farms, involving all-male sprayers as the pesticide-exposed group and all other male workers as a control group. Data were collected using a standard questionnaire for respiratory symptoms developed by the British Medical Research Council and the American Thoracic Society. Lung function tests were performed to determine forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), mid 50 expiratory flow, and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC. Chi-squared tests and Poisson regression analyses were used to compare respiratory symptoms between the two working groups. General linear regression models were used to compare lung function test indices between spraying and non-spraying working groups. The significance level was set to 0.05. Results: A total of 285 male workers participated (152 sprayers and 133 non-spraying workers). The mean age of the workers was 25 years for sprayers and 24 years for non-sprayers. The proportions of cough, cough with sputum, breathlessness, and wheezing were similar in the two groups, while chest tightness was significantly high in the non-spraying group. Sprayers had significantly higher FVC and FEV1 than the non-spraying group. Conclusions: Respiratory symptoms were not different between the sprayers and non-spraying workers except that the non-spraying workers had increased chest tightness. FVC and FEV1 were significantly higher among sprayers relative to non-sprayers. The results must be interpreted with caution, as the sprayers used respiratory protective equipment, which probably reduced their exposure to the pesticides. Also, the workers were young, and a healthy worker effect might be present among the sprayers.

N2  - Teff (Eragrostis tef) is an ancient cereal that is indigenous from Ethiopia. Nowadays, teff grain is becoming popular to many parts of the world. Teff is gluten-free in nature, has high iron and fiber content, and many other health benefits make this crop interesting to many consumers. Since no insect pests are attacking the teff grains, farmers do not apply pesticides on it, unlike maize and other grains. Nevertheless, residues of organochlorine pesticides have been detected at an alarming level that could pose a consumer risk. Teff is often consumed as injera which is a fermented flat pancake. The main aim of the present study is, therefore, to investigate the effect of household food processing (doughing and baking) on the reduction of pesticide residues from teff. Pesticide residues previously detected in teff grain such as permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, p,p’-DDE, p,p’-DDD, o,p’-DDT, and p,p’-DDT were spiked and extracted followed by the subsequent household processing which are generally doughing (dough making followed by fermentation) and baking. From the findings of this study, doughing decrease the pesticide residues in the range of 59.9–86.4% and baking in the range of 63.2–90.2%. Kruskal−Wallis analysis indicates that the reduction of pesticide residues by baking is significantly different from doughing (p-value < 0.0001). There is also a significant difference between non-fermented and fermented dough (p-value = 0.012). The processing factor for doughing and baking was less than one (PF < 1 = reduction factor) which indicates the reduction of pesticides due to teff processing. The cumulative effect of these processing methods is important to evaluate the risks associated with the ingestion of pesticides, particularly in teff grain.

N2  - In Ethiopia, postharvest losses, mainly storage losses by insects, are very critical problems in agricultural production systems. In particular, maize is highly susceptible to insect and pest attacks in the storage. These storage losses affect the livelihood of small-scale farmers by aggravating their food insecurity and reducing their household income. This critical problem forced the farmers to look forward modern storage technologies like Purdue improved crop storage (PICS) bags, but its adoption is considerably low in the study area. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to examine the determinants to use PICS bags for maize storage. Data were collected through semistructured questionnaire, group discussion, key informants, and direct observation. A total of 392 sample household heads were selected by simple random sampling techniques. Binary logistic regression model, descriptive statistics, and inferential statistics were employed to analyze the data. This study revealed that, about 58% of the respondents replied that the importance of PICS bags in reducing insect damage was high. The results of binary logit model also indicated that educational level, sex, awareness, training, accessibility, perception on the effect of pesticide, social responsibility, and total income of the household positively and significantly affect farmers' decision to use PICS bags. Moreover, the price of PICS affects negatively and significantly. Therefore, policy makers have to give emphasis for this newly introduced storage technology to address storage loss problems by taking in to account these determinants.

N2  - Sustainable agriculture focuses using agricultural resources with minimum possible negative environmental externality to produce more food. The present study reports the environmental and health risks associated with the use, management and handling of agrochemical in the Central Rift Valley, Ethiopia. Six Woredas (or districts) covering both upstream and downstream areas and major ecosystems were selected. Data were collected using focus group discussion, key informant interviews, field observation and literature review. Pesticide Risks in the Tropics for Man, Environment and Trade tool was used to analyse data. Results indicated that local community’s awareness on use, handling and management of pesticides was low. Applications of insecticides, fungicides and herbicides polluted surface water systems and affected aquatic animals and plants with different level of risk (i.e. from no or insignificant risk to acute and chronic levels). The level of risks of using agrochemical on aquatic animals, human and the environment increased when the agricultural practices changed from good to non-good practices (i.e. increasing frequency of application). The types of agrochemicals determined the levels of risks on aquatic animals, human and the environment. For example, copper hydroxide and Lambda pose high risk, whereas Chlorpyrifos poses possible risk on fish under good agricultural practices. Also, the results indicated that the level of risks of using agrochemicals on fish and aquatic vertebrates was high for few pesticides (e.g. Chlorpyrifos) under both good and bad agricultural practices. The results of the present study support decision makers, practitioners and farmers to put corrective measures when importing agrochemicals, provide targeted risk management schemes including training on safety measures and screen agrochemicals on the market, respectively.

N2  - Background: Pregnant women who are infected with malaria usually have more severe symptoms and negative health outcomes than women who are not pregnant, with higher rates of miscarriage, intrauterine demise, premature delivery, low-birth-weight neonates, and neonatal death. Based on evidence from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey, this study assessed the variation in insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) usage and its associated factors among pregnant women in Ethiopia. Methods: Data from a total of 1122 women who were pregnant at the time of the survey were included in the final analysis. Bivariate and multilevel analyses were conducted. Multilevel modeling with fixed and random coefficients was used to estimate the variation in pregnant women’s ITNs usage across communities (residence areas) and regions of Ethiopia. Results: Out of the total 1122 pregnant women, 58.37% slept under a net and 41.63% did not sleep under nets. Significant variations were observed in pregnant women’s ITNs usage across communities (residence areas) and regions of Ethiopia, with between variations in pregnant women’s ITNs usage across communities (residence areas) and regions. In addition, the region, place of residence, wealth index, educational level, and age of the women as well as whether they believed that mosquito bites cause malaria were significant factors in pregnant women’s usage of ITNs. Pregnant women in Ethiopia had moderate usage of ITNs with varied risk factors at the individual, community, and regional levels. Conclusion: Based on the factors identified, there is a need to implement and/or strengthen programs (e.g., regular sensitization) that intensify high coverage of ITNs for effective malaria prevention in Ethiopia, especially among pregnant women who do not use ITNs.

N2  - Teff (Eragrostis tef) is the most important staple cereal food crop in Ethiopia. It accounts for 25% of the annual gross grain production. Teff rust [Uromyces eragrostidis] is the most important and widely distributed teff disease in the country; it causes grain yield losses of 10%–41% annually. Presently, no teff germplasm immune to this disease has been found. The objectives of this study were to determine the resistance of 2000 E. tef landrace accessions and 5000 mutant lines to teff rust and the effects of sowing dates, plant maturity, and fungicides application on teff rust severity. The majority of teff landrace accessions and mutant lines had a high incidence of teff rust infection with susceptible reaction types, i.e., large uredia without chlorosis. None of teff landrace accessions and mutant lines showed complete resistance, but 22 landrace accessions had lower teff rust severity levels. Low rust severity was associated with early sowing dates and early-maturing teff varieties, indicating the beneficial effect of early maturing in escaping the disease. The average yield loss incurred because of teff rust varied from 6% to 33% across three sowing dates. Although, no significant yield differences were observed among the fungicides tested, propiconazole (Tilt® 250 EC and Bumper® 250 EC) was found to reduce more teff rust severity. © 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Four malt barley varieties (Beka, HB 120, HB 52 and Holker) and 3 fungicide (propiconazole) spray intervals (7, 14, 21 day) and no spray control were arranged in a RCBD in 4 replications to assess net blotch (Pyrenophora teres) effect on malt quality. The varieties were grown at Holetta agricultural research center in 2005, on 12 m2 plot. Grain flour starch pasting and malt qualities were analyzed. Mash odour and colour were evaluated qualitatively. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in malt qualities were observed among varieties and also due to spray intervals in hot water extract (HWE, mean range = 76.6 to 79.7%). The varieties had a pasting- time and -temperature (Ti) of 4.7 to 5.0 min and 64.7 to 66.3°C, respectively. Peak, hot paste, cold paste, breakdown and setback viscosities were ranged 276.5 to 314.9, 176.3 to 218.3, 294.1 to 333.2, 86.3 to 99.6 and 102.4 to 116.4 BU, respectively. The pasting curves indicate no amylo- or -waxy starches with evidence of no damage by sprout- induced a-amylase activity and spray intervals. The varieties Ti matches mashing temperature (64 to 65°C) used in malt barley brewing. Malts from these grain varieties were prepared under controlled conditions. Malt aroma and flavor was similar with industry malt of sugary sweet taste. Thousand-kernel malting weight loss (TKMWL) was 11 to 13% and is in the range for desirably modified barley grain on malting. The varieties had a malt protein 6.4 to 7.4% and free amino nitrogen (FAN) 124.4 to 140.0 mg/100 g malt (db). The diastatic tendency assessed using malted barley flour as sources of enzymes and refined wheat flour starch as a substrate (1:29) showed a reduction in peak viscosities (mean) of the substrate starch paste from 678.0 to 168.0 BU. The varieties did not show consistent quality requirements in all parameters. Beka and HB 120 were better than HB 52 and Holker in HWE and diastatic tendency. The FAN level was high among HB 120, HB 52 and Holker. The findings indicate that net blotch incidence and severity influenced HWE and filtration time. © 2011 Academic Journals.

N2  - In eastern Ethiopia, empirical information regarding farmers’ perceptions and implementation of research results about stem borer management is either scarce or unavailable. A survey of 120 farmers from four maize- and sorghum-growing districts of eastern Ethiopia was carried out in 2014 to study common management practices of cereal stem borers. Drought, pests, and land shortage were reported as the main constraints to maize and sorghum production in the area. Stem borers were perceived as the most important pests in these crops. The estimated yield losses from stem borers ranged from 10% to 50%. The majority of the farmers reported not using chemical insecticides to control these pests due to lack of capital, unavailability, and lack of knowledge. Moreover, most farmers were not using improved maize varieties. Cultural practices were found to be the most promising control method of cereal stem borers. Despite differences among districts, farmers practiced crop rotation, intercropping, manipulation of planting dates, crop residue disposal, and post-harvest tillage as common control strategies, even though a considerable proportion of the farmers was not implementing these practices sufficiently. The design of appropriate strategies for stem borer management based on farmers’ needs and priorities should be promoted.

N2  - The extensive use of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) pesticide leads to the contamination of surfaces and groundwater. In this respect, it is critical to develop an inexpensive and environmentally friendly adsorbent for 2,4-D-laden agricultural leachate. In the current study, termite mound soil (TMS) from Ethiopia was used as an adsorbent in a batch mode aimed at the removal of 2,4-D from an aqueous solution. The TMS was characterized using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The effects of various operating parameters such as pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, and initial concentration were investigated. In addition, the optimization process and interaction effect were studied using response surface methodology (RSM). A high 2,4-D removal percentage (89.6%) was achieved for a 2,4-D initial concentration of 50.25 mg/L at pH 2, an adsorbent dose of 15.25 g/L, and a contact time of 180.5 min. The 2,4-D adsorption isotherms could be adequately described by the Langmuir model (R2 = 0.9687), while the kinetics of the 2,4-D adsorption on the TMS best fit the pseudo-second-order model. Overall the study showed that TMS is an effective adsorbent for the removal of 2,4-D from agricultural leachate.

N2  - A method is described for the simultaneous determination of carbaryl (1-naphthyl methylcarbamate), malathion [diethyl (dimethoxythiophosphorylthio) succinate], fenitrothion (O,O-dimethyl O-4-nitro-m-tolyl phosphorothioate), and diazinon (O,O-diethyl O-2-isopropyl-6-methylpyrimidin-4-yl phosphorothioate) in sesame (Sesamum indicum: L.) seeds. Sesame seeds were Soxhlet extracted with n-hexane, and the extract was subjected to a liquid-liquid partitioning and column cleanup to remove the oily coextractives prior to analysis by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The mean percent recoveries (± standard deviations) from sesame seeds fortified with carbaryl (0.004 to 0.035 μg/g), malathion (0.53 to 4.25 μg/g), fenitrothion (0.22 to 1.78 μg/g), and diazinon (0.54 to 4.35 μg/g) were 83.3 ± 5.7, 85.5 ± 6.6, 85.6 ± 7.2, and 88.4 ± 4.8, respectively. The method was used for the simultaneous analysis of carbaryl, malathion, fenitrothion, and diazinon residues in sesame seeds obtained from an Ethiopian field crop that had been treated with the pesticides during its growing period.

N2  - Carbendazim is a pesticide commonly used in Ethiopian flower farms and has harmful effects on aquatic, invertebrate, and mammalian life. Previous studies have explored ways to remedy carbendazim toxicity; however, the use of constructed wetland (CW) systems for carbendazim removal from farm water runoff has not been explored in depth. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a CW system for carbendazim removal from wastewater runoff. A two-stage pilot CW was built and tested for its efficacy of carbendazim removal under saturated conditions and varying hydraulic loading rates. The influent was pumped into the first vertical-flow mesocosm. The drained water was then pumped into the second mesocosm. The collected effluent was tested for carbendazim removal. Carbendazim removal efficiencies up to 91.80% (with a hydraulic loading rate of 100 Ld-1 and influent carbendazim concentration of 10 μg L-1) were observed. Statistical analysis indicated that the removal of carbendazim was not correlated with the initial carbendazim concentration but was negatively correlated with the hydraulic loading rate used. Two pesticide removal mechanisms were briefly probed to determine their participation in carbendazim removal. Substrate sorption accounted for 18% of total carbendazim removal; furthermore, plant uptake also played an active role.

N2  - Punica granatum L. (pomegranate), belonging to the Punicaceae family, is a plant native to the Middle East. Its fruit has gained widespread popularity as a functional and nutraceutical food and hence, pomegranate growing has noticeably increased in southern Italy from 43 ha in 2010 to 168 ha in 2015 (http://agri.istat.it/). In June 2015, a severe outbreak of powdery mildew was observed on 70% of 450,000 2-year-old pomegranate plants cvs. Wonderful One and Ako in a nursery located in Lecce Province, Italy. White, dense plaques of mycelium and conidia covering 30 to 40% of the young leaves were observed. At later stages of disease development, leaves turned yellow and abscised. No chasmothecia were detected. The conidiophore foot cell was cylindrical and the appressorium lobed. Microscopic observations of 300 conidia from each of 10 plant samples showed that they were hyaline, ellipsoid to cylindrical, measuring 28.1 to 35.7 × 12.9 to 14.4 μm (average 32.8 × 13.4 μm), fibrosin bodies were absent, and the germ tube was subterminal. ITS genomic regions were sequenced for molecular identification. DNA was extracted from conidia and mycelium by using InstaGene Matrix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA), amplified by PCR using the universal ITS5/ITS4 primers, and the amplicon was sequenced by external service (Macrogen, Seoul, South Korea). BLASTn analysis of the ITS sequence (563 bp) showed a high homology (identity: 99%; e-value: 0.0; coverage: 99%) with species of the Erysiphe aquilegiae clade (i.e., E. aquilegiae [EU047570.1], E. sedi [JX173288.1], Pseudoidium hortensiae [JQ669944.1], and P. neolycopersici [GU358451.1]) (Takamatsu et al. 2015). Artificial inoculations were made by gently pressing naturally diseased leaves onto 20 young fully expanded leaves of 10 healthy potted plants cv. Wonderful One grown under glasshouse conditions at 25 ± 2°C. Five noninoculated plants served as controls. Typical powdery mildew symptoms developed within 7 to 10 days only on inoculated leaves. Therefore, on the basis of morphological features, the pathogen was tentatively identified as Erysiphe sp. and, according to the BLASTn results, it appears to belong to the still unresolved E. aquilegiae clade. The ITS sequence was deposited in GenBank under accession number KU060880. E. punicae T.M. Achundov, whose gene sequences are not available, was reported as the causal agent of powdery mildew on pomegranate in Azerbaijan (Akhundov 1987), Iran (Khodaparast and Abbasi 2009), and Montenegro; anamorphs of powdery mildews on pomegranate were also recorded from Ethiopia, Greece, India, Iraq, Ukraine, and Crimea but it is unclear if they belong to E. punicae (Braun and Cook 2012). This is the first report of powdery mildew on pomegranate in Italy. Due to the poor availability of fungicides allowed on the crop, improved disease management methods are needed to prevent heavy yield losses.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Reliance on fungicides to manage disease creates selection pressure for the evolution of resistance in fungal and oomycete pathogens. Rust fungi (Pucciniales) are major pathogens of cereals and other crops and have been classified as low-risk for developing resistance to fungicides; no case of field failure of fungicides in a cereal rust disease has yet been recorded. Recently, the Asian soybean rust pathogen, Phakopsora pachyrhizi evolved resistance to several fungicide classes, prompting us to screen a large sample of the globally widespread wheat yellow rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), for mutations associated with fungicide resistance. RESULTS: We evaluated 363 Pst isolates from Europe, the USA, Ethiopia, Chile, China and New Zealand for mutations in the target genes of demethylase inhibitor (DMI; Cyp51) and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI; SdhB, SdhC and SdhD) fungicides. A high proportion of Pst isolates carrying a Y134F DMI resistance-associated substitution in the Cyp51 gene was found among those from China and New Zealand. A set of geographically diverse Pst isolates was also found to display a substitution in SdhC (I85V) that is homologous to that reported recently in P. pachyrhizi and linked to SDHI resistance. CONCLUSION: The identification of resistance-associated alleles confirms that cereal rusts are not immune to fungicide resistance and that selection for resistance evolution is operating at high levels in certain locations. It highlights the need to adopt fungicide resistance management practices and to monitor cereal rust species for development of resistance. © 2021 The Authors.

N2  - The Agricultural Growth Program (AGP) in Ethiopia is a multifaceted investment program supporting agricultural productivity and the commercialization of smallholder farmers. The AGP is expected to positively affect household food security by increasing agricultural productivity and production. The extent to which the AGP has affected farmers’ economic efficiency and productivity is an interesting policy issue. This study employed a switching regression with the stochastic frontier model to investigate differences in total factor productivity (TFP) between beneficiary and non-beneficiary farmers in AGP. It also estimated the role of technological progress, technical and scale efficiencies in conditioning TFP. Results show that participation in AGP provided significantly higher TFP compared to non-participation. While technical progress did contribute to the observed increase in output, improving technical efficiency has also the potential to increase output by as much as 40% with existing technology and resources. The study suggests that there are opportunities to improve productivity growth and food security in smallholder farms over time through more active research and extension activities in Ethiopia. In the AGP, technical progress has been achieved in the use of irrigation, high yielding crop varieties, modern agricultural machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides. Since technical change is the most important source of the growth in productivity, policy changes that support the use of modern agricultural inputs directly or indirectly is likely to improve the agricultural sector in Ethiopia.

N2  - Desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) outbreaks have occurred repeatedly throughout recorded history in the Horn of Africa region, devastating crops and contributing to famines. In June 2009, a desert locust swarm invaded the Guassa Plateau, Ethiopia, a large and unusually intact Afroalpine tall-grass ecosystem, home to important populations of geladas (Theropithecus gelada), Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis), thick-billed ravens (Corvus crassirostris), and other Ethiopian or Horn of Africa endemics. During the outbreak and its aftermath, we observed many animals, including geladas, ravens, and a wolf, feeding on locusts in large quantities. These observations suggest surprising flexibility in the normally highly specialized diets of geladas and wolves, including the potential for temporary but intensive insectivory during locust outbreaks. To our knowledge, Guassa is the highest elevation site (3,200-3,600 m) at which desert locusts, which require temperatures >20°C for sustained flight, have been reported. Continued monitoring will be necessary to determine whether the June 2009 outbreak was an isolated incident or part of an emerging pattern in the Ethiopian Highlands linked to global warming. The intensive consumption of desert locusts by geladas, wolves, and ravens during the outbreak at Guassa raises concerns about pesticide-based locust control strategies and potential unintended adverse effects on endemic and endangered wildlife. © 2010 Japan Monkey Centre and Springer.

N2  - This study evaluated farmers’ knowledge, perceptions and insect pest management practices of maize in the northwestern part of Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia. Data was collected by a validated questionnaire from 108 farmers. The association between the variables was assessed using Chi-square test and Ordinal Logit regression model was used to explain the association between the level of insect pest infestation on maize grain and other socio-economic factors. The results showed that pest attack was a common phenomenon and caused up to 60% grain losses. Maize weevil: Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and moths Sitotroga cerelala (Olivier) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) were identified as the most common and damaging insects. All farmers are using chemical insecticides (Actellic dust and Phostoxin) extensively to minimize the problem. It is concluded that some efforts have to take in changing in farmers’ attitude on the use of chemical pesticide and the knowledge gap identified in using cultural practices to manage maize weevil.

N2  - Background: Despite the apparent benefits of organophosphate compounds (OPCs) acute organophosphate (OP) pesticide poison is an increasing problem worldwide. In a country like Ethiopia, where agriculture is a major component of the economy, these compounds are readily available to the general public. There is paucity of evidence from Ethiopia showing the pattern of organophosphate poisoning (OPP) in healthcare facilities. The objective of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the pattern of acute OPP at the University of Gondar Teaching Hospital in northwest Ethiopia, during September 2010 through December 2014 was conducted. Data was collected through chart review of patients who were admitted due to poisoning. Data was analysed using SPSS 20. Results: Organophosphate poisoning in University of Gondar teaching hospital accounts for about 38.46% of all emergency room admissions for poisoning. Out of the 90 cases studied 60% (54) were women, with male to female ratio of 1:1.5. The mean age of the patients was 25.5 with a standard deviation of 9.45. 56.7% of the cases studies lived in an urban environment compared to 43.3% who lived rurally. In the vast majority of patients, 90% (81) patients had ingested OP as an act of suicide. Regarding the route of exposure, oral ingestion was most common in suicidal cases (88.9%). The elapsed time between the time of poison ingestion and the start of the treatment, ranged from 13 min to 1 day. Health care professionals’ useds decontamination methods such as gastric lavage and activated charcoal (45.6%) and 36.7% use atropine for OPP treatment. The mean hospital stay was 0.74 days. In the present study family problems were a leading cause of suicides and accounted for 45.8% of all cases. Conclusion: As a developing nation who economy relies heavily on agriculture, Ethiopia continues to have OP compounds remain a common cause of acute poisonings. This is particularly concerning for younger generation who have high rates of OPP and whose numbers continue to raise. This data suggests that it is essential to strengthen Ethiopians regulatory policy concerning the availability of OPCs. Additionally, it will be important to design an appropriate health education program for the prevention of both suicidal and accidental OPPs for the benefit of the public at large.

N2  - Introduction: A large proportion of the Ethiopian population (approximately 68%) lives in malaria risk areas. Millions of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) have been distributed as part of the malaria prevention and control strategy in the country. This study assessed the ownership, access and use of LLNs in the malaria endemic southwest Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in southwest Ethiopia during October– November 2015, including 836 households from sixteen villages around Gilgel-Gibe dam area. Indicators of ownership, access and use of LLINs were derived following the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) guidelines. Factors associated with failure for both LLIN access and use were analysed at household level using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: The proportion of households with at least one LLIN was 82.7% (95% CI: 80.0, 85.1). However, only 68.9% (95% CI: 65.6, 71.9) had enough LLINs to cover all family members (with ≥one LLIN for every two persons). While 75.3% (95% CI: 68.4, 83.0) of the population was estimated to have accessed to LLINs, only 63.8% (95% CI: 62.3, 65.2) reported to have used a LLIN the previous night. The intra-household gap (i.e., households owning at least one LLIN, but unable to cover all family members) and the behavioral gap (i.e., household members who did not sleep under a LLIN despite having access to one) were 16.8% and 10.5%, respectively. Age, marital status and education of household heads, as well as household size and cooking using firewood were associated with the access to enough LLINs within households. Decreased access to LLINs at households was the main determinant for not achieving ≥80% household members sleeping under a LLIN the previous night. Other associated factors were household size and education level of household head. Conclusions: LLIN coverage levels in study villages remain below national targets of 100% for ownership and 80% for use. The access to enough LLINs within the households is the main restriction of LLIN use in the study area.

N2  - Field survey was conducted in south eastern Ethiopia to determine the disease intensity of chocolate spot and rust and to investigate the association of disease intensity (incidence and severity) with environmental factors and crop cultural practices. A total of 280 faba bean fields were surveyed in eight districts, and type of cropping system, weed management practices, crop growth stage, previous crop in the field, and sowing date were recorded. The associations of disease intensity with independent variables were evaluated using logistic regression model. Mean disease incidence of chocolate spot varied from 70.9 to 93.2% in most fields while percentage severity index (PSI) ranged from 10.5 to 47.1%. In a reduced multiple variable model, chocolate PSI ≤ 30% showed high probability of association with mixed cropping system, good weed management practices, late planting, and when faba bean was rotated with vegetables and cereals. The mean disease incidence of faba bean rust was varied from 23.6 to 78.2%, while the mean PSI of rust was varied from 4.8 to 37.9%. In Gasera, Dinsho, and Agarfa districts, poor weed management practices, fields planted in the month of July, and when previous crop was legume had a high probability of association to (>20) rust PSI in a multiple variable reduced model. In contrast, soil types, fertilizer applied, and fungicides sprayed were not associated with disease intensity. The present study has identified cropping system, planting date, previous crop, district, and weed management practices as important variables that influence faba bean chocolate spot and rust epidemics in diversified fields. Therefore, proper weeding management practices, late planting, crop rotation habit, and other related farm practices should be carried out to reduce chocolate spot and rust impact until resistant faba bean genotypes are developed and distributed to the area.

N2  - Pulse crops are important components of crop production in Ethiopia's smallholders’ agriculture, providing an economic advantage to small farm holdings as an alternative source of protein, cash income, and food security. Mung bean is one of the most important cash crops in the low land of the North Shewa zone. This research was, therefore, initiated to provide an insight of scaling up of Rasa (N-26) mung bean variety and documenting best approaches to maximize production and productivity of the crop through improving the availability of improved varieties to farmers. The activities were done in the lowlands of North Shewa areas of Efiratana gidim, Kewot, Shewarobit, Ensaro, and Merhabetie districts, under main growing season for two consecutive years (2016 – 2017) using Rasa variety. About 54 ha of land were covered through disseminating 2.17tons seed and a total of 203 (including 2 female farmers) farmers participated and directly benefited during the dissemination of mung bean variety. The productivity of mung bean in the area was boosted to 1.6 tons ha-1 and a yield advantage of 45.5% was obtained from improved varieties compared to the local cultivar. The introduction of the improved variety Rasa (N-26) which has a large seed size, high biomass, and grain yield attracts the attention of farmers, experts, and local traders. Developing and verifying pesticides, technical backstopping and supplying of early generation seed, and introducing post-harvest storage materials is very crucial for sustained production and productivity improvement of the crop.

N2  - The objective of the study was to understand the socio-economic and cultural conditions of crop cultivation practices of farmers; the willingness of farmers towards tractor use and the factors that affect the start of tractor hiring services (THS). A total of 148 households were considered for the survey. Both purposive and stratified sampling techniques were employed disaggregated by sex, wealth status and soil types owned. Data collection techniques included structured interview and focused group discussion. Both descriptive and econometrics techniques were employed to analyze the data. The findings showed that labor shortage (69.7%), high rate of weed infestation (26.5%) and shortages of herbicides (27%) were the main challenges of weeding in the study area. Likewise, shortage of oxen (52%) and labor (43.3%) were found to be challenges related to ploughing practice. About 80% of the sampled farmers were willing to use THS if available in the study area. The econometric model result showed that being a model farmer, sex of a household, land holding, adult female labor endowment, oxen endowment and experience in use of herbicides were positively and significantly affecting farmers’ willingness to use THS. However, age of the head of a household negatively affected the willingness to use THS. From the results of the study it is possible to conclude that since oxen ownership and oxen ploughing practice are deeply rooted in Ethiopian tradition, awareness creation and close follow up are required at all levels for adoption of mechanization.

N2  - In Ethiopia, post-harvest losses caused by insects are a major challenge in crop production systems. Dried maize is particularly susceptible to insects during storage. Storage loss affects the livelihoods of small-scale farmers leading to food insecurity and loss of income. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the cost-benefit analysis of Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags on maize storage in Northwest Ethiopia. Cross-sectional data was collected from 392 randomly selected households from both users and non-users of PICS bags, using stratified sampling technique. A structured questionnaire, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, individual in-depth interviews, and field observations were used to gather the data. A cost-benefit analysis was computed to evaluate the viability of PICS bags for maize storage. The binary logistic regression model was used to identify factors that affect the use of PICS bags. Descriptive statistics (percentage, mean, and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (t-test and chi-square test) were employed to analyze the data. The benefit-to-cost ratios (BCRs) of insecticide with both ordinary and PICS bags were greater than one, but PICS bags resulted in more than two-fold higher values as compared to insecticide with ordinary bags. The net present value (NPV) at 15% discount rate in 2018 was 20.73 USD and 25.35 USD per 100 kilograms of stored maize when insecticide was applied to ordinary and PICS bags, respectively. Sensitivity analysis with a 10% cost increment and up to 50% price discount showed that both technologies would still be viable for maize storage. However, PICS bags had higher NPV and BCR; making the technology more viable than insecticide with ordinary bags. The results of binary logit model indicated that educational level, gender, awareness, training, accessibility of the technology, perception of the technology, involvement in leadership activities in the community, and total income of the household positively influenced farmers’ decisions to use PICS bags, whereas price negatively affected the use of the PICS bags. PICS bags had clear economic advantage over insecticide with ordinary bags for maize storage in Northwest Ethiopia. Efforts should be made to disseminate and improve access to PICS bags for strengthening food security and increasing incomes of maize farmers in Northwest Ethiopia.

N2  - Genetic engineering (GE) technologies can contribute to improve crop productivity and quality in Ethiopia. Adoption of commercialized insect resistance and herbicide tolerance technologies can help to protect major crops such as cotton, maize, sorghum and small cereals from their main insect pests or prevent heavy weedinflicted loss. Moreover, key production constraints such as bacterial wilt of enset, late blight of potato, drought stress on crops like maize and wheat, lodging resistance on tef as well as low nutritive quality of native crops like enset and grasspea can be addressed by strengthening domestic GE research capacity and international collaboration. Cognizant of this potential, the Ethiopian government has made significant investment in modern biotechnology capacity building in the last decade. There has also been specific interest by cotton sector to boost its productivity by adopting insect resistance (Bt) technologies. However, the GE regulatory system based on the existing biosafety law is so stringent that it is not possible for the country to access useful technologies from abroad as well as initiate domestic GE research. Consequently, no GE experiment is approved so far, leaving the country at risk of missing out on the global GE revolution. To catch up and harness the benefits of GE technologies, the country needs to create conducive regulatory environment, strengthen domestic GE capacity and devise a farsighted strategy.

N2  - This study was initiated to document information on the levels of sediment contamination with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Moreover, it was intended to identify compounds which impose major ecological risks to aquatic organisms. Surficial sediments were collected from 46 locations within the streams and rivers of the Awash River Basin. In total 30 compounds were included in this study: 16 OCPs, 7 PCBs and 7 PBDEs. The total concentrations of OCPs, PCBs, and PBDEs ranged from 6.63 to 206.13 ng g-1- dry weight (dw), 0.85 to 26.56 ng g-1-dw and 3.71 to 18.95 ng g-1-dw respectively. Out of all the tested OCPs, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, p,p0-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p0-DDT) and β-hexachlorocyclohexane (β-HCH) were the most abundant in the study area. The ratio of (β-HCH/EHCHs) indicated that HCHs were originally from earlier usage of HCH in the area whereas the ratio of (p,p'-DDT/p,p'-DDE) showed that the majority of DDT components were recently introduced into most of the sampling locations. Even though there were relatively low concentrations of PBDEs and PCBs across the sampling sites, substantial amounts of PCBs were observed in Addis Ababa City. According to the established ecological risk indices, p,p'- DDT and γ-HCH are the major concerns for potential adverse ecological impacts. This study provided the first comprehensive information on organohalogenated compounds' (OCs') occurrences, spatial distributions, and ecological risks in sediments of the Awash River Basin. Thus, the report will be very useful background information for further studies on sediment contamination with OCs' in the region. It also adds important first-hand data to the field of fresh water ecology and provides useful empirical evidence for setting pollution control priorities for an ecologically important, yet largely understudied region.

N2  - Farmers in the developing world are at risk of pesticide exposure, particularly in low-income countries with a sizable agricultural sector like Ethiopia. The present investigation provides baseline data to develop strategies for the control of pesticide exposure and the prevention of pesticide poisoning. Methods: A questionnaire survey of a stratified random sample of peasant farmers belonging to peasant associations was conducted. Results: Most surveyed farmers sprayed pesticides without any personal protective equipment. The majority of participants reported using empty pesticide containers for drinking and food storage. Twenty percent of farmers applied pesticides by sweeping with plant leaves in a hazardous manner. Conclusions: Ethiopian peasant farmers appeared to have limited knowledge of the hazards of pesticides and generally did not handle pesticides in a safe manner. Active health education campaigns and appropriate training programs should be instigated to promote safe use of pesticides. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - Field experiment was carried at Burji, Bonke and Chencha during the 2018 cropping season to evaluate the effects of host resistance and fungicide application on yellow and stem rusts and grain yield (GY) of bread wheat. Five wheat varieties and four different fungicides were included as treatment and laid out in factorial arrangement in randomized complete block design with three replications. Significant (p ≤ 0.01) difference was observed in the magnitude of the parameters of disease and crop measured between treatments. Results showed that the mean terminal severities of yellow and stem rusts were highest at Chencha than at Burji and Bonke. Yellow and stem rust terminal severities as low as 46.41%, 40.69%, 29.22%, 28.24% and 21.74% and 43.67%, 42.54%, 40.93%, 16.07% and 17.15% were recorded on Hidase, Kubsa, Ogolcho, Wane and Shorima varieties, respectively, due to the integrated use of Tilt 250 EC, Rex® Dou and Natura 250 EW foliar applications across the three locations. Crosswise assessment revealed that the lowest area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) of yellow rust of 15.73%, 14.93%, 10.42%, 8.79% and 7.67%-days was recorded on Hidase, Kubsa, Ogolcho, Wane and Shorima varieties, respectively, and that of stem rust of 18.96%, 17.33%, 16.36%, 6.80% and 6.37%-days was registered on Kubsa, Ogolcho, Hidase, Shorima and Wane varieties, respectively, as a result of combined use of Tilt 250 EC, Rex® Dou and Natura 250 EW foliar applications. The combined effect of variety and fungicide application in addition to environmental variability exhibited pronounced effects on the epidemic development of yellow and stem rusts through their effects on disease progress rate and spike infection. Rex® Dou and Natura 250 EW fungicides in combination with all the evaluated varieties proved to be effective against the rust management and gave the higher values of yield parameters and monitory advantage over the unsprayed plots. GY loss of up to 69.64% was recorded on unsprayed plots of Ogolcho as compared to fungicide sprayed plots of other varieties evaluated. Thus, Rex® Dou and Natura 250 EW fungicides in combination with wheat variety having a different level of resistance to wheat rusts could be suggested to the farmers in the study areas and elsewhere with similar agro-ecological conditions for efficient management and optimization of the GY. Further studies have to be sought in similar and other agro-ecologies elsewhere in Ethiopia for at least two consecutive years over locations to come up with a solid recommendation.

N2  - The flower industry in East Africa has grown in recent years, especially in the production and export of roses. The aim of this study was to assess pesticide use on selected flower farms in Ethiopia. Serum cholinesterase levels in workers were used as a marker of pesticide exposure. This study was a cross-sectional study involving 588 workers from 15 different flower farms. It had a response rate of 95.5%. The participants included 277 males (mean age 26 years; 148 pesticide sprayers and 129 non-sprayers) and 311 females (mean age 25 years; 156 working in greenhouses and 155 working outside the greenhouses). The researchers undertook structured interviews, blood sampling, and walkthrough surveys. Descriptive statistics and Poisson regression were used in the statistical analyses. A total of 154 different trade names of pesticides were found. Of them, 31 (27%) were classified as moderately hazardous by the WHO, and 9% were organophosphates. Serum levels of cholinesterase deviating from 50–140 Michel units were considered abnormal. Abnormal serum cholinesterase levels (above 140 Michel units) were found in 97 participants (16.5%, 95% confidence interval 13.7%–19.7%). There were no differences between the four job groups regarding cholinesterase levels. The high prevalence of abnormal serum cholinesterase levels might indicate the presence of pesticide intoxication. Thus, there is a need for routine monitoring of all workers exposed to pesticides, not only sprayers.

N2  - The invasion and wide spread of Spodoptera frugiperda represent real impediments to food security and the livelihood of the millions of maize and sorghum farming communities in the sub-Saharan and Sahel regions of Africa. Current management efforts for the pest are focused on the use of synthetic pesticides, which are often economically unviable and are extremely hazardous to the environment. The use of biological control offers a more economically and environmentally safer alternative. In this study, the performance of the recently described parasitoid, Cotesia icipe, against the pest was elucidated. We assessed the host stage acceptability by and suitability for C. icipe, as well as its ovigenic status. Furthermore, the habitat suitability for the parasitoid in the present and future climatic conditions was established using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP). Cotesia icipe differentially accepted the immature stages of the pest. The female acceptance of 1st and 2nd instar larvae for oviposition was significantly higher with more than 60% parasitism. No oviposition on the egg, 5th and 6th larval instars, and pupal stages was observed. Percentage of cocoons formed, and the number of emerged wasps also varied among the larval stages. At initial parasitism, parasitoid progenies, time to cocoon formation and overall developmental time were significantly affected by the larval stage. Egg-load varied significantly with wasp age, with six-day-old wasps having the highest number of mature eggs. Ovigeny index of C. icipe was 0.53. Based on the models, there is collinearity in the ecological niche of the parasitoid and the pest under current and future climate scenarios. Eastern, Central and parts of coastal areas of western Africa are highly suitable for the establishment of the parasitoid. The geographic distribution of the parasitoid would remain similar under future climatic conditions. In light of the findings of this study, we discuss the prospects for augmentative and classical biological control of S. frugiperda with C. icipe in Africa.

N2  - The flower industry is among the most important export industries in Ethiopia, employing more than 50,000 workers. The working conditions and health status among workers in Ethiopian flower industry are not documented. A questionnaire-based interview was conducted among 213 flower industry workers from 3 flower farms and 60 control workers from supermarkets from February to March 2012. A walk-through survey was also performed on the 3 flower farms. Interviewed flower farm workers have high prevalences of respiratory and dermal symptoms, which are rarely reported among controls. Female workers inside the greenhouses on the 3 flower farms have significantly more respiratory and dermal symptoms than workers outside the greenhouse, also when adjusting for age and education. Limited access to personal protection equipment (PPE) and unsafe pesticide routines are documented. This study indicates that working in these flower greenhouses might be associated with adverse health effects. © 2015

N2  - Residue levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCP) in a total of 90 cattle samples comprising meat, liver and kidney collected from carcasses slaughtered in six towns in West Shoa Zone, Ethiopia, (Ambo, Guder, Ginchi, Gedo, Holeta and Tikur Inchini), have been determined. The pesticides were extracted by solid phase extraction (SPE) and quantification was carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A good linearity (r2 > 0.998) was found in the range 0.001-7.00 mg/kg for the samples studied. Most of the pesticides had recoveries in the range 81-99% and values of relative standard deviation (RSD) <7.2% for repeatability and reproducibility, showing good accuracy and precision of the method. The concentration level of the studied organochlorines followed the order: p, p' dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) > endosulfan>o,p′-DDT >lindane>dieldrin>endrin>aldrin>chlorothanolin while the order of contamination in the analyzed organs was liver > kidney > meat. Heat treatment of the meat, kidney and liver samples (boiling for 90 min.) produced an overall reduction of 62.2%, 44.5%, 37.7%, 29%, 31%, 34.3% and 30.8% in lindane, o, p′-DDT, endosulfan, p, p′-DDT, chlorothanolin, aldrin, dieldrin, and endrin, respectively. Although the residual contents of the organochlorines detected in all the contaminated samples analyzed from the six cities were below the respective maximal permissible levels set by international organizations, samples from Holeta town were more contaminated and may necessitate effective monitoring as bioaccumulation of these residues may pose health problems in human beings. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Background: Countdown to 2015 was a multi-institution consortium tracking progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 and 5. Case studies to explore factors contributing to progress (or lack of progress) in reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) were undertaken in: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Niger, Pakistan, Peru, and Tanzania. This paper aims to identify cross-cutting themes on how and why these countries achieved or did not achieve MDG progress. Methods: Applying a standard evaluation framework, analyses of impact, coverage and equity were undertaken, including a mixed methods analysis of how these were influenced by national context and coverage determinants (including health systems, policies and financing). Results: The majority (7/10) of case study countries met MDG-4 with over two-thirds reduction in child mortality, but none met MDG-5a for 75 % reduction in maternal mortality, although six countries achieved >75 % of this target. None achieved MDG-5b regarding reproductive health. Rates of reduction in neonatal mortality were half or less that for post-neonatal child mortality. Coverage increased most for interventions administered at lower levels of the health system (e.g., immunisation, insecticide treated nets), and these experienced substantial political and financial support. These interventions were associated with ~30-40 % of child lives saved in 2012 compared to 2000, in Ethiopia, Malawi, Peru and Tanzania. Intrapartum care for mothers and newborns - which require higher-level health workers, more infrastructure, and increased community engagement - showed variable increases in coverage, and persistent equity gaps. Countries have explored different approaches to address these problems, including shifting interventions to the community setting and tasks to lower-level health workers. Conclusions: These Countdown case studies underline the importance of consistent national investment and global attention for achieving improvements in RMNCH. Interventions with major global investments achieved higher levels of coverage, reduced equity gaps and improvements in associated health outcomes. Given many competing priorities for the Sustainable Development Goals era, it is essential to maintain attention to the unfinished RMNCH agenda, particularly health systems improvements for maternal and neonatal outcomes where progress has been slower, and to invest in data collection for monitoring progress and for rigorous analyses of how progress is achieved in different contexts.

N2  - A one-step microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) procedure was developed for the simultaneous extraction of organophosphorus pesticide and fungicide residues in soil which have been greatly used in agriculture. Parameters that could influence the MAE efficiency such as irradiation power, temperature, time and solvent were investigated, and extraction efficiencies in the range of 92.6-103.7% were obtained using 400 W (100% output) at 160 C for 10 min with only 12 mL of acetone-hexane (2:1, v/v). The analytes in extracts were analyzed directly by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) without any further cleanup. At 5 and 50 ng g-1 fortification levels for each analyte, the average recoveries obtained were ranged from 70.0% to 120.0% with relative standard deviation (RSD) between 0.2% and 14%. The method was linear over 1-250 ng g-1 with a correlation coefficient (r2) between 0.9916 and 0.9966. The detection limits (S/N=3) were between 0.10 and 0.12 ng g -1. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by analyzing field soil samples collected from six intensive horticultural sites in Ethiopia. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - The international cut flower industry is strongly criticized because of its environmental impacts and unsafe working conditions. Increasing certification of cut flowers is used to improve the growers’ environmental and social performance. But what is the impact of this private governance instrument on regulating the use of pesticides? This paper assesses the potential of private certification on governing the environmental and social problems from pesticide use along the global cut flower supply chain. We use detailed farm-level data to analyse the environmental and social impacts of flower certification in Ethiopia by comparing different national and international certification schemes. Our analysis does not show significant differences between these different private standards for most environmental and health and safety variables. The Ethiopian cut flower industry remains far from improving its sustainability performance through private certification. However, certification schemes may enable farmers to have access to international markets and keep up their reputation.

N2  - Pesticides are widely used chemicals in the agricultural sector to control pests, diseases, and other plant pathogens. This study aimed to assess the storage conditions of pesticides, the community perception, and health risk of pesticide exposure. The study was conducted in three different zonal cities in Ethiopia, East Africa, namely Mekelle, Aksum, and Alamata. Community perception was studied in a community living near a pesticide stockpile with a cross-sectional study of 384 randomly selected households. In addition, questionnaires were administered, a field investigation was conducted, and focused group discussions with responsible bodies were held to assess storage condition. Accidental ingestion and inhalation were considered to determine average daily exposure (ADE) and incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR). This study reveals that all obsolete and banned hazardous pesticides were stored in one area. The storage sites were only secured with simple locks and exposed to rain, sunlight, and temperature variation. The majority of the residents perceived that pesticides pose risk to human health (46.6%), to the environment (28.4%), and to animals (25%). The association between residence proximity of respondents to the store and side effect of obsolete pesticides is statistically significant (p = 0.008). Children aged 2 years and below have higher ADE when exposed to the same concentration of contaminant via inhalation. The probability of a person developing cancer was very low with a risk value of 2.54E−08 and 1.65E−07 as a result of exposure to air containing heptachlor and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), respectively.

N2  - In comparison to other types of resilience, livelihood resilience in the context of climate-related extremes like droughts is grounded in actual-life scenarios with the purpose of carefully assessing and improving the resiliency of individuals, households, communities, and nations. This study assesses households' livelihood resilience to droughts in Raya Kobo District. A mixed approach with a concurrent research design was used to achieve this goal. The quantitative data were collected from 354 randomly selected survey respondents, while the qualitative data were collected from purposefully chosen FGD and KI participants. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were employed to analyse the quantitative data, whereas thematic data analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data through the creation of major and sub-themes. To determine households’ livelihood resilience, the livelihood resilience index (LRI) was measured using thirty-eight indicators of resilience based on the five livelihood assets. The study identified fifteen latent dimensions, such as infrastructure, technology, water harvesting scheme, land quality, cropping season, household working capacity, farm experience, educational status, social trust, risk response, social security, support service, income, crop diversity, and assets. The average score of these latent dimensions is 0.3999, suggesting that households in the study area are less resilient. The MLR results show a positive association between the latent dimensions and LRI and the relative importance of the latent dimensions for LRI. These findings provide significant policy implications regarding mitigating vulnerability, strengthening resilience, and establishing pathways out of livelihood insecurity. Education, healthcare, road construction, agricultural inputs (pesticides, herbicides, chemical fertilizers, and improved seeds), irrigation technologies (small-scale drip irrigation systems and human-powered pedals), income diversification, social trust, risk response, social security, support services, and asset building should be the focus of policymakers. © 2023

N2  - In the 21st century, the practice of agriculture is becoming more interesting, valuable, and attractive by integrating many technologies and systems. Among the different technologies and systems Crop Simulation Models (APSIM, DSSAT, and AquaCrop) are widely used to predict crop yield, forecast climate change impacts, and optimize different management practices including pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Many researchers used these computerized representations of crops worldwide and in Ethiopia for the aforementioned purposes. These crop models were used in Ethiopia by different researchers for yield prediction. Climate change impacts assessment, and the most crucial factor that policymakers and agricultural production system planners should consider when making decisions is the ability of crop simulation models, such as the agricultural production system simulator (APSIM), to save time and resources while improving prediction accuracy. Because most models are poorly or never evaluated, it is unknown if they are useful in the decision-making process. Thus, to simulate the growth, development, yield, and climate change impacts of the chosen crops in Ethiopia, this research reviews the status, application, accuracy of result prediction, challenges, and research opportunities of the APSIM crop simulation model in Ethiopia's agroecological environment. © 2024 The Authors

N2  - Introduction With the widespread availability of a vast number of chemicals and drugs, acute poisoning is a common medical emergency worldwide. In spite of the success of interventions to prevent toxic ingestions, acute poisoning continues to be an important public health problem. Because of weak regulations and limited health care services in developing countries, adverse outcomes from poisoning are more prevalent than in the developed world. Due to the limited Ethiopian literature on this topic, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate and report poisoning cases, their management and outcome in northwest Ethiopia. Methods This is a retrospective study of all poisoning cases admitted and managed in the emergency centres of Gondar Teaching Referral Hospital and Metema and Debark district hospitals, from September 2010 to December 2014. Data was collected through retrospective chart review of patients who were admitted due to poisoning. Results There were 543 registered poisoning cases listed in the registry during the study period, of which 344 cases (63.4%) had complete data and were included in the final analysis. There were 48,619 emergency centre visits during the study period, with poisoning cases accounting for 1.1%. Females (60%) were predominant among intentional as well as unintentional poisoning cases. Patients between 15 and 24 years of age accounted for 55% of the cases. Patients poisoned with organophosphate and bleaching agents accounted for 35% and 25%, respectively. Among the poisoning patients, 74% were treated with decontamination, while those exposed to organophosphate were treated with atropine 45.5% (55/121) of the time. Discussion Young females comprise a group at increased risk for suicidal poisonings. As a developing nation, pesticide and bleaching agents remain a significant cause of acute poisonings in Ethiopia. Intentional poisoning remains the most significant identified cause of poisoning overall. © 2017 African Federation for Emergency Medicine

N2  - Agriculture is the foundation of economy for Ethiopia. The majority of people in the study area rely on rain-fed subsistence agriculture for their livelihood. As a result, smallholder farmers were more susceptible to climate change due to their reliance on a single rain season and lack of climate change adaptation technologies. The sustainability of food crop production, which employs the majority of the labor force in the nation, is threatened by climate change. The study's objectives were to look at indigenous and improved adaptation technologies in reaction to local climate change effects and barriers to adaptation among smallholder farmers. A closed-ended, semi-structured questionnaire was used to gather the data from 400 smallholder farmer household heads. An analysis of the variables influencing farmers' decisions regarding climate change adaptation was conducted using binary logistic regression model. The fitness and accuracy of the model were examined using an omnibus test of model coefficients. The study's findings showed that absence of crop insurance, a lack of training and demonstration, a lack of non-farm employment, a lack of weather forecasting and early warning, shortage of finance, the high price of farm inputs, and reliance on a single rain season were the main barriers preventing farmers from adapting to climate change. The most popular indigenous adaptation techniques used by smallholder farmers included mixed cropping of local variety, reducing social and religious rituals, mixed farming (local crop and livestock), and reducing the amount of food consumed. The primary improved adaptation strategies used by the farmers included the use of chemical fertilizers, various agrochemicals, and soil and water conservation methods. The binary logistic regression model's findings showed that access to extension services by household heads significantly and favorably influenced farmers' decisions to scale back social and religious rituals, reduce food consumption, sell livestock, and adopt improved mixed farming as a means of adapting to climate change. Farm experience significantly influenced the farmers’ decision to practice improved mixed farming; access to the market significantly affected farmers’ decision on soil and water conservation practices; and the age of the respondents significantly influenced the farmers’ decision to practice improved crop variety as a response to climate change adaptation. The study's conclusions showed that a number of factors limited farmers' attempts to adapt to climate change. The study recommends that decisions regarding adaptation plans should concentrate on reducing these barriers. © 2022 The Author(s)

N2  - Plasmodium and soil-transmitted helminth (STH) coinfection is a major public health problem in developing countries. Its prevalence and associated factors are poorly addressed in the available research. Therefore, this study aimed to assess Plasmodium-STH coinfection prevalence and associated factors among malaria-suspected patients attending Shewa Robit Health Center, north-central Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 379 malaria-suspected patients attending Shewa Robit Health Center from April to May 2023. Stool and blood samples were collected from each participant. Plasmodium and STHs were detected from blood and stool samples by using blood film and the Kato-Katz method, respectively. Data were entered into Epi Info version 7 and analyzed by SPSS version 26. Descriptive statistics were used to compute Plasmodium-STH coinfection. Logistic regression was used to identify associated factors. Variables with a P-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Among the study participants, 27.9%, 20.3%, and 13.4% were positive for Plasmodium, STHs, and Plasmodium-STH coinfection, respectively. The prevalence of Plasmodium-Ascaris lumbricoides coinfection was high (7.6%). Unavailability of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), improper use of ITNs, absence of indoor residual spraying, presence of stagnant water, and previous malaria infection were significantly associated (P <0.01) with Plasmodium infection. Being illiterate, using an unimproved latrine, having an untrimmed fingernail, and practicing open defecation were also significantly associated (P <0.03), with STH infection. Being male, illiterate, and living in rural areas were significantly associated (P <0.03) with Plasmodium-STH coinfection. The prevalence of Plasmodium-STH coinfection was high in malaria-endemic areas. Therefore, malaria-suspected cases should be checked for STH infection.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anaemia, characterized by low red blood cell or haemoglobin levels, impairs oxygen transport in the body and poses a major global public health issue, particularly affecting pregnant women and children. This study focuses on identifying the factors contributing to anaemia among pregnant women receiving antenatal care (ANC) at Mizan-Tepi University Teaching Hospital (MTUTH) in southwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based unmatched case-control study was conducted from July 1 to August 30, 2022, involving 370 pregnant women (90 with anaemia and 280 without). Data collection included questionnaires, laboratory tests (Hgb and stool examination), and anthropometric measurements. SPSS version 21 was used for data analysis, with binary logistic regression identifying factors associated with anaemia. The significance level was set at a p-value <0.05. RESULTS: The study achieved a 100% response rate for both cases and controls. Factors identified as determinants of anaemia among pregnant women included malaria infection (AOR = 7.83, 95% CI: 3.89-15.8), hookworm infection (AOR = 2.73, 95% CI: 1.39-5.34), short birth interval (AOR = 7.11, 95% CI: 3.59-14.2), and history of unsafe abortion (AOR = 5.40, 95% CI: 2.46-11.8). CONCLUSION: This study found that malaria infection, hookworm infection, birth interval <33 months, and a history of unsafe abortion are factors contributing to anaemia in pregnant women. Strategies such as distributing insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to combat malaria, improving sanitation, anthelmintic drugs, promoting family planning to prevent unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions, and providing preconception care can help reduce the incidence of anaemia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Local understandings of malaria and use of preventive measures-are critical factors in sustained control of malaria. This study assessed caretakers' knowledge on malaria, use of Long Lasting Insecticide Treated Nets (LLINs) and care-seeking behavior for their children's illness in different malaria transmission settings of Ethiopia. METHODS: Data were collected from 709 caretakers of children of 2-9 years of age during in 2016. A standard questionnaire was used to assess caretakers' perceptions of malaria, use of LLIN and care seeking behavior for febrile illness of children aged 2-9 years. RESULTS: The caretakers recognized malaria mostly by chills (70.4%, 499/709), fever (45.7%, 324/709) and headache (39.8%, 282/709). Overall, only 66.4% (471) of the caretakers knew that mosquito bite caused malaria and that it was quite heterogeneous by localities (ranging from 26.1% to 89.4%) and altitude (p < 0.05). Majority, 72.2% (512), of the caretakers knew that sleeping under LLIN could prevent malaria. Overall knowledge on malaria (mean = 51.2%) was very low with significant variations by localities, altitude and levels of malaria transmission, being low in high altitude and low in transmission areas (p < 0.05). Four hundred ninety-one (69.3%, 491/709) of the children slept under LLIN in the previous night. Of malaria related knowledge items, only knowledge of LLIN was associated with net use; non-use of LLN was higher among caretakers who did not know the role of LLIN (AOR = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.28-0.77, p = 0.003). Of course, attributing causation of malaria to stagnant water discouraged use of net (p = 0.021). Of febrile children (n = 122), only 50 (41.0%) sought care with only 17 (34.0%) seeking the care promptly. There was no significant link between knowledge of malaria and care seeking behavior (p > 0.05). However, knowledge of malaria had some level of influence on treatment source preference where caretakers with greater knowledge preferred pharmacy as source of care. CONCLUSIONS: The findings demonstrated that caretakers' understanding of malaria was unsatisfactory with marked heterogeneity by localities. The present evidence suggests that knowledge is not sufficient enough to drive LLIN use and care seeking. Yet, context-specific health education interventions are important besides ensuring access to necessary preventive tools.

N2  - Malaria is a life-threatening disease that caused more than 400,000 deaths in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015. Mass prevention of the disease is best achieved by vector control which heavily relies on the use of insecticides. Monitoring mosquito vector populations is an integral component of control programs and a prerequisite for effective interventions. Several individual methods are used for this task; however, there are obstacles to their uptake, as well as challenges in organizing, interpreting and communicating vector population data. The Horizon 2020 project "DMC-MALVEC" consortium will develop a fully integrated and automated multiplex vector-diagnostic platform (LabDisk) for characterizing mosquito populations in terms of species composition, Plasmodium infections and biochemical insecticide resistance markers. The LabDisk will be interfaced with a Disease Data Management System (DDMS), a custom made data management software which will collate and manage data from routine entomological monitoring activities providing information in a timely fashion based on user needs and in a standardized way. The ResistanceSim, a serious game, a modern ICT platform that uses interactive ways of communicating guidelines and exemplifying good practices of optimal use of interventions in the health sector will also be a key element. The use of the tool will teach operational end users the value of quality data (relevant, timely and accurate) to make informed decisions. The integrated system (LabDisk, DDMS &amp; ResistanceSim) will be evaluated in four malaria endemic countries, representative of the vector control challenges in sub-Saharan Africa, (Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ethiopia and Zambia), highly representative of malaria settings with different levels of endemicity and vector control challenges, to support informed decision-making in vector control and disease management.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Malaria remains prevalent in developing countries. This is particularly true among the community who are prone but do not apply malaria prevention and controlling strategies. In one of the malarious areas of Ethiopia (Shewa Robit), the acceptance level of indoor residual spraying (IRS) is indicated to be low as per guidelines. However, factors determining communities' acceptance of IRS are not well-investigated. Hence, this study was designed to identify the determinants for the acceptance of IRS in order to indicate priorities for malaria prevention and control. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was used among 649 households in Shewa Robit town, from February to March 2021. Households were selected from five IRS-targeted kebeles. Data were collected using structured questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify the independent factors associated with the acceptance of IRS. RESULTS: The response rate in this study was 98%. The proportion of community who accepted the IRS for malaria prevention was 56.5% [95% confidence interval (CI): 52.7-60.2%]. Being male [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.21, 95% CI: 1.32-3.72], having good knowledge (AOR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.33-3.84), did not paint/re-plaster the wall after spraying (AOR = 3.99, 95% CI: 2.36-6.76), did not perceive any side effects after spraying (AOR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.11-2.99), effectiveness of previous IRS (AOR = 2.99, 95% CI: 1.85-4.84), non-utilization of long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) (AOR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.33-0.84), and spraying the house at the right season (AOR: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.11-4.13) were determinant factors for the acceptance of IRS. CONCLUSIONS: To increase the acceptance level of IRS among the communities, health interventions and services should focus on the awareness creation toward the effectiveness of IRS, proper spraying time/season, and side effects of IRS. Therefore, strengthening health information dissemination could help promote the acceptance of IRS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Schoolchildren with asymptomatic malaria infections often go undiagnosed and untreated, serving as reservoirs for infection that hamper malaria control and elimination efforts. In this context, little is known about the magnitude of asymptomatic malaria infections in apparently healthy schoolchildren in Ethiopia. This study was aimed at determining the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria infection and its associated factors in apparently healthy schoolchildren in Ethiopia. METHODS: From September 2021 to January 2022, a school-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 994 apparently healthy schoolchildren (aged 6-15 years) selected from 21 primary schools in the Gomma district, of Jimma zone, southwestern Oromia, Ethiopia. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select schools and participants. After allocating the total sample proportionally to each school and then to each grade, participants were selected using the lottery method from a list of student records (rosters). Finger-pricked blood samples were collected for microscopy blood film preparation and malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (SD Bioline Malaria Ag Pf/Pv). Moreover, dry blood spots (DBSs) were prepared onto filter papers for quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. RESULTS: As determined by RDT and microscopy, the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria was 2.20% and 1.51%, respectively. Using qPCR, the overall prevalence was 5.03% (50/994). Of this, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and mixed infections accounted for 90%, 6% and 4%, respectively. Submicroscopic asymptomatic malaria infection was also accounted for 70% (35/50) of the overall prevalence. Household head age, nighttime outdoor activities of household heads, family history of malaria, absence of insecticide-treated nets (ITN), and presence of stagnant water around the houses are all significantly associated with asymptomatic malaria infections among schoolchildren. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that both RDT and microscopy underestimated the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in schoolchildren. However, qPCR was able to detect even low levels of parasitaemia and revealed a higher prevalence of asymptomatic submicroscopic malaria infections. The findings imply that schoolchildren with asymptomatic malaria infection are potential hotspot for malaria reservoir that fuels ongoing transmission. Therefore, it is imperative to include schoolchildren and schools in malaria intervention package and equally important is the adoption of more advanced and sensitive diagnostic tools, which would be crucial for successful malaria control and elimination efforts. Targeted interventions for asymptomatic malaria-infected schoolchildren can provide invaluable support to the National Malaria Control Programme in controlling and eventually eliminating the disease.

N2  - In the context of reduced transmission of malaria, it is essential to examine the association between exposure to malaria and haemoglobin level. This study measured the Haemoglobin level of children 2-9 years of age and examined its association with malariometric indices. A cross sectional study was conducted, during June 2016, on 763 children 2-9 years old, recruited from ten sites representing different malaria transmission settings in Ethiopia. Haemoglobin concentration was determined using HemoCue analyzer. Malariometric indices (splenomegaly rate, parasite rate and serological marker) were measured. The overall prevalence of anaemia was 17.3% (95% CI: 14.6-19.9) in the study population. Mild, moderate and severe anaemia accounted for 7.3%, 7.2% and 2.8% respectively. Of the children with anaemia (132), only 7 (5.3%) had malaria parasitaemia. The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia was 3.6% (2/56), 9.1% (5/55) and 0.0% (0/21) among children with mild, moderate and severe anaemia, respectively. Malaria reactive antibody and anaemia co-occurred in 3.13% (21/672) of the samples. Seroprevalence and parasitaemia did not have significant association with anaemia (p>0.05). However, splenomegaly was significantly associated with increased risk of anaemia (AOR=14.93; p=0.001). Anaemia was significantly higher among children 2-4 years old (22.2%), and children living in households without any insecticide treated bed net (34.0%). The prevalence of anaemia was lower by 55.0% among children living in households with at least one net (AOR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.21-0.96). Repeated exposure to malaria infections (seropositive) and parasitaemia was less likely to contribute to development of anaemia among children 2-9 years in this study setting. Thus, in low malaria endemic settings, anaemia prevention and control program required to reconsider the historical evidence that suggests malaria is one of the major risk factor for anaemia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem affecting humans, particularly in the tropics and subtropics. Children under 5 years old are the group most vulnerable to malaria infection because of less developed immune system. Countries have set targets that led to control and eliminate malaria with interventions of the at-risk groups, however malaria infection remained a major public health challenge in endemic areas. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at determining the magnitude of malaria and associated factors among febrile children under 5 years old in Arba Minch "Zuria" district. METHODS: The study was conducted from April to May 2017. Blood samples were collected from 271 systematically selected febrile children under 5 years old. Thin and thick blood smears were prepared, stained with 10% Giemsa and examined under light microscope. Data of sociodemographic data, determinant factors, and knowledge and prevention practices of malaria were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire. Data were analyzed using binomial and multinomial regression model in SPSS(®) Statistics program, version 25. RESULTS: Among those febrile children, 22.1% (60/271) were positive for malaria; 50.0%, 48.33% and 1.66% of them were positive for Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and mixed infections of both parasites, respectively. Malaria infection was associated with nearby presence of stagnant water to resident areas (AOR=8.19; 95%CI: 3.62-18.5, P<0.0001). Children who slept under insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) were more likely to be protected from malaria infection than those did not sleep under an ITNs (AOR=9.65; 95%CI: 4.623-20.15, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Malaria infection is highly prevalent in children aged between 37 and 59 months old, in Arba Minch "Zuria" district. The proximity of residence to stagnant water and the use of ITNs are the most dominant risk factor for malaria infection. Improved access to all malaria interventions is needed to interrupt the transmission at the community level with a special focus on the risk groups.

N2  - Late blight is an important disease of potato in Ethiopia, causing up to 100% loss in susceptible cultivars. In this study, two putatively resistant cultivars of relatively recent introduction (Jalenie and Gudenie) and a widely grown susceptible cultivar (White Flower) were evaluated for late blight severity and yield under five different contact fungicide (mancozeb) regimes and in unsprayed plots. Trials were carried out at two major potato production locations in southern Ethiopia: Awassa and Kokate, located at 1700 and 2156 meters above sea level, respectively. Greater disease pressure occurred at Awassa but the three cultivars performed consistently based on relative disease severity levels at the two locations. While White Flower was assigned a susceptibility score of 8 (highly susceptible) in both sites, Jalenie had scores between 1 and 0, and Gudenie had scores of 3 and 4, in Awassa and Kokate, respectively. With Jalenie, one application of contact fungicide was sufficient in both trials, while for Gudenie, two sprays appeared more appropriate as little or no gain was clear with three or more sprays. With the susceptible White Flower, four sprays were beneficial but little benefit was evident with the fifth spray. © the Brazilian Phytopathological Society.

N2  - Biological control by predators of insect pests is an important benefit of biodiversity, having a contribution to agricultural production. By preying on crop infesting insect pests, predatory arthropods and birds can provide an important ecosystem service. They support agricultural productivity, boosting crop yield and reducing demand for pesticides expense. Habitat quality of land use types, i.e., explained by vegetation cover, can impact the provision of ecosystem services thereby influencing the prevalence of the predators and their predation rates. In order to better understand the level of insect pest control service by predators, we conducted a field experiment to investigate levels of predation, using an attack on artificial caterpillars in response to land use types varied in vegetation cover. We found the attack rate by arthropods was more consistent across land use types than by birds, and the attack by birds was higher in modified land use types with sparse woody vegetation. Moreover, the attack rate for birds showed a decreasing tendency with increasing woody species richness, cover and stem density, while it showed less variation for arthropods. We conclude that biological control by birds is more effective in habitats with simplified vegetation cover than for arthropods in agricultural landscapes. Therefore, we recommend the prevalence of shade trees and small forest patches in agricultural landscapes for supporting the increased levels of insect pest control services provided by predatory birds and arthropods. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria infection during pregnancy is a significant public health problem that puts pregnant women at risk. Interruption of transmission of asymptomatic malaria among a population remained a challenge and the host serves as a reservoir for the malaria parasite; and is also recognized as a major barrier to malaria elimination. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria and associated factors among pregnant women in the Boset District, East Shoa Zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria and associated factors in pregnant women from February to March 2022. Using multistage sample techniques, 328 asymptomatic pregnant women were enrolled. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. A rapid test and Giemsa-stained blood smear microscopy were used to diagnose Plasmodium infections. Epi info version 7 was used to code, enter, and clean data before being uploaded to SPSS version 25.0 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression were employed to find the associated factors. Variables in the multivariable model with a p-value < 0.05 were considered significantly associated with asymptomatic malaria. RESULTS: Of the total 328 pregnant women who participated in this study, 9(2.74%) and 10(3.05%) were confirmed to be infected with Plasmodium species by microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests, respectively. Asymptomatic malaria during pregnancy was found to be significantly associated with not using an insecticide-treated bed net [(P = 0.002, AOR: 9.61; 95% CI (2.22-41.53)], lack of consultation and health education about malaria prevention during Antenatal care attendance [(P = 0.04, AOR: 4.05; 95% CI (1.02, 16.05)], and living close stagnant water [(P = 0.02, AOR: 4.43; 95% CI (1.17,16.82)]. CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that asymptomatic malaria is prevalent in pregnant women. Not using insecticide-treated bed nets, inadequate health education during antenatal care, and living close to stagnant water are significantly associated with malaria infection. Thus, using insecticide-treated bed nets, health education, and avoiding stagnant water from residential areas could play significant roles in preventing asymptomatic malaria among pregnant women in the study area.

N2  - This study aimed to investigate the extent and determinants of vegetable commercialization among smallholders in the Sebeta Hawas Woreda, Oromia region, Ethiopia. Data were collected through surveys of 385 farm households. The study results indicated that vegetable production in the study area is highly commercialized in terms of vegetable output marketed with an average commercialization extent of 74.2% although vegetable commercialization extent is at a low level (34.82%) in terms of land areas allotted to vegetable production. The results of the truncated Tobit regression model revealed that the extent of vegetable commercialization was significantly and positively influenced by the gender of the household head, year of schooling, family size, access to irrigation facilities, cooperative membership, access to credit services, contact with extension agents, access to improved seeds, access to chemical fertilizers, and access to market information. Conversely, the age of the household head, livestock holdings, and participation in off-farm activities significantly and negatively influenced the extent of vegetable commercialization. The study suggests that vegetable commercialization can be enhanced by supplying farm inputs such as improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and irrigation equipment. In addition, designing gender-focused intervention programs is essential to promote the equal participation of both men and women in vegetable production and marketing. Moreover, providing adequate and relevant market information and strengthening farmers’ cooperatives can enable smallholder farmers to access the market and increase their market participation so that they can obtain reasonable returns from the vegetable business. © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Pesticides are frequently used by plant cultivars to control pests that could affect yield. Although many local farmers in Eastern Ethiopia use organophosphate insecticides extensively for the production of khat, the pattern and treatment outcome of acute poisoning of these organophosphates has been poorly quantified and reported in this region. MATERIALS AND METHOD: A cross-sectional study design was employed at two public hospitals found in Harari region, Ethiopia. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews and card review, then analyzed with SPSS version 20. Pearson's Chi-square test was used to compare independent variables with the treatment outcome. Statistical significance is defined at 95% confidence interval of odds ratio not including 1 or p < 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 135 cases of organophosphate were admitted in the emergency departments of the hospitals during the study period. 42.2% of participants were adolescents (age: 11-20 years) while the mean age of all participants was 18.8 ± 12.9 years with a range of 1-61 years. 73.7% of the study participants were rural residents. The result showed that 47.4% of the cases were exposed to the poison accidentally. Family disharmony was the common reason among cases poisoned intentionally. The mean time elapsed between poisoning and reaching the health facility was 3.1 h. Atropine was administered for 47% of the cases. About 11% of cases expired following the poison. The home remedy given, lag time, and residency were found to be factors significantly related to poor treatment outcomes. CONCLUSION: Easy availability, low cost, and excessive popularity of organophosphate use as pesticides in Eastern Ethiopia have increased the incidence of ingestion, resulting in increasing intentional and unintentional poisoning. In the present study, accidental exposure accounts for 47.4%.

N2  - Background: Birth defects (BDs) are the major causes of infant morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Regardless of their clinical importance, few studies on predisposing factors have been conducted in Ethiopia. However, due to a lack of advanced diagnostic materials, we only considered the externally visible BDs. Objective: To assess the determinants of externally visible birth defects among perinatal deaths at Adama Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. Methods: A retrospective unmatched case-control study design was conducted from November 01 to 30, 2021. The sample size was determined by Epi Info version 7 software considering sample size calculation for an unmatched case-control study. A total of 315 participants (63 cases, and 252 controls) were selected by simple random sampling. Data were collected by an open data kit (ODK) and transported to a statical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 26 software for analysis. The bivariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were done to determine the factors associated with the BD. Results: This study showed that drinking alcohol during pregnancy (AOR = 6.575; 95% CI: 3.102,13.937), lack of antenatal care (ANC) follow-up during pregnancy (AOR = 2.794; 95% CI: 1.333, 5.859), having a history of stillbirth in a previous pregnancy (AOR = 3.967; 95% CI: 1.772, 8.881), exposure to pesticides during pregnancy (AOR = 4.840; 95% CI: 1.375, 17.034), having a history of BDs in a previous pregnancy (AOR = 4.853; 95% CI: 1.492, 15.788), and lack of folic acid supplementation during early pregnancy (AOR = 4.324; 95% CI: 2.062, 9.067) were significant determinants of externally visible BDs among perinatal deaths. Conclusion: In this study, alcohol use, exposure to pesticides, and lack of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy were identified as the major determinants of externally visible BDs among perinatal deaths. Thus, health education regarding the associated factors of BDs and their preventive strategies should be given to pregnant mothers. © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - Beekeeping has been an integral part of the Ethiopian agriculture and yielding 1.3% of agricultural GDP. Hence, the study was aimed to evaluate the purpose of beekeeping and major constraints impeding beekeeping practices at Lemo District, Hadiya Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Questionnaires were organized to collect survey data. A multi-stage purposive sampling technique was used and one hundred forty respondents (140 beekeepers) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Key informant interviews and Focus group discussion to support the interpretation of the interview data. The data were organized and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance via Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Accordingly, beekeeping was mostly carried out using traditional hives. From beekeeper’s respondents 80%, are involved in beekeeping mainly for both income and household consumption. Beekeepers use income obtained from beekeeping for buying crop inputs, payment for annual land taxation, and purchase food grain. The mean honey yield of traditional log hives, transitional top-bar hives, and modern hives with frames were 5.25 ± 0.38, 7.52 ± 0.54, and 12.78 ± 0.56 kg per hive per year, respectively. The most hampering factors for honey bee production were honey bee diseases, improper pesticide application, and shortage of bee forage. The finding of this study concluded that beekeeping was mostly carried out using traditional hives. Hence, well-organized training should be given for the beekeepers to practice internal colony inspection and improved beekeeping technologies via a full package program. Efforts should be geared to alleviate constraints like honey bee diseases, improper application of pesticides, and bee forage shortage hampering beekeeping in the district. © 2021 International Bee Research Association.

N2  - Sugarcane smut is the most important bottleneck in sugarcane production in Ethiopia. Previous management attempts couldn’t protect the crop from smut sustainably. Therefore, experiments were conducted with the objective to assess the combined effect of varietal resistance, fungicide, and Trichoderma harzianum seed cane treatments on smut, cane, and sugar yields at Metehara and Wonji, Ethiopia. Thirty-six treatments were planted in a split plot design, with three varieties as main plots and twelve seed cane treatments as subplots in three replications. Consequently, untreated NCo-334 variety demonstrated greater smut intensity (incidence and severity), followed by untreated Mex 54-245 at Wonji in plant cane. Ratoon crops prevailed similar trends of infection except that Mex 54-245 treated with Apron, Triadimefon + Native Trichoderma harzianum (NT) and NT were unable to protect smut. Moreover, NCo-334 with all treatments at ratoon showed different levels of smut intensity at Wonji. On the other hand, greater mean smut intensity prevailed at Metehara than at Wonji. Overall, up to 30.75 and 29.80%, increase in cane and sugar yield respectively, could be achieved with seedcane treatments as compared to untreated control at the two locations. In general, the results of disease intensity, sugar yield, and economic analysis demonstrated that Opera and Opera + NT could be used as seedcane treatments after verification and demonstration for end users. The better protection against smut up to ratoon crop cycle, and economic return were the main reason to consider these treatments as candidates. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - The article focuses on evaluating the technical efficiency of garlic production in northwest Ethiopia. The average yield in the region was lower than its potential, indicating a need to improve farming practices. Data were collected from 359 garlic producers using random sampling. The Cobb-Douglas stochastic frontier production function was used to estimate technical efficiency, which was found to be 73%. This means that about 27% of potential garlic output was lost due to inefficiency. Factors such as land size, seed, fertilizer, insecticide, and oxen days were found to have a positive and significant impact on garlic production. On the other hand, factors like age, extension contact, distance, renting land, garlic disease shock, access to finance, and access to information were linked to technical inefficiency. The study suggests that investing in high-quality seeds, improved farming inputs, and access to information can enhance garlic output by leveraging its high efficiency level. © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of human life. Its effect was particularly severe in sectors that are directly related to agricultural production and food security. This research was conducted to uncover the perception of smallholder farmers in eastern Ethiopia about the pandemic, prevention and control measures, and its impact on their livelihood. Through a semi-structured interview schedule conducted on 176 randomly selected rural households, we found a varying level of practicing the recommended COVID-19 prevention and control measures. The study also found that the response of the media, family members and religious organizations to the pandemic was rated as “very good”. The most important impact of the pandemic was associated with household’s inability to obtain a reasonable price for their agricultural produce, and inability to attend religious gatherings/prayers. Other impacts of the pandemic were fear of losing friends and getting sick/losing life. Considering the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, a reinforced awareness creation campaign, behaviour change communication by extension workers, and continued provision of basic health and sanitation facilities was recommended. Such interventions should focus on improving the access of smallholders to Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs). Continued engagement with diverse media platforms and developing trust is also needed to increase the spread of reliable COVID-19 related information. Moreover, safeguarding the agricultural sector against risks and uncertainties has to be prioritized through strengthening early warning system, distributing improved/early-maturing seeds and fertilizers, providing insecticides/pesticides, linking smallholders to market outlets, and emergency food aid via the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP). © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - Food contamination has significant effects on consumers’ health. The present study aimed to estimate some heavy elements (copper, manganese, nickel, lead, cadmium, chromium, zinc, and iron) and quantify the residuals of pyrethroid pesticides such as cypermethrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, and bifenthrin in coffee products in the markets of Baghdad city. Coffee available in the market was from Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Uganda, Indonesia, Guatemala, and Colombia, and 24 different samples were used for the study. The concentrations of heavy metals were estimated using the atomic absorption technique, while the pesticide residues were calculated using the LC-MS technique. The results showed that the copper, manganese, nickel, and zinc concentrations for all coffee samples were within acceptable limits. As for the concentrations of chromium and iron, some samples exceeded the permissible limits, such as the highest concentration of chromium was 1.137 mg/kg, and that iron was 57.089 mg/kg. The pyrethroid residues were high, and cypermethrin, deltamethrin, permethrin, and bifenthrin were on the higher side than the permissible levels and were recorded as 0.437, 0.833, 1.063, and 0.753 mg/kg, respectively, exceeding the maximum limits set by international standards. © (2023), (Connect Journal).

N2  - BACKGROUND: A mosquito repellent has the potential to prevent malaria infection, but there has been few studies demonstrating the effectiveness of combining this strategy with the highly effective long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). This study aimed to determine the effect of combining community-based mosquito repellent with LLINs in the reduction of malaria. METHODS: A community-based clustered-randomised trial was conducted in 16 rural villages with 1,235 households in southern Ethiopia between September and December of 2008. The villages were randomly assigned to intervention (mosquito repellent and LLINs, eight villages) and control (LLINs alone, eight villages) groups. Households in the intervention villages received mosquito repellent (i.e., Buzz-Off petroleum jelly, essential oil blend) applied every evening. The baseline survey was followed by two follow-up surveys, at one month interval. The primary outcome was detection of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, or both parasites, through microscopic examination of blood slides. Analysis was by intention to treat. Baseline imbalances and clustering at individual, household and village levels were adjusted using a generalized linear mixed model. RESULTS: 3,078 individuals in intervention and 3,004 in control group were enrolled into the study. Compared with the control arm, the combined use of mosquito repellent and LLINs significantly reduced malaria infection of all types over time [adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.45-0.97]. Similarly, a substantial reduction in P. falciparum malaria infection during the follow-up surveys was observed in the intervention group (aOR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.31-0.89). The protective efficacy of using mosquito repellent and LLINs against malaria infection of both P. falciparum/P. vivax and P. falciparum was 34% and 47%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Daily application of mosquito repellent during the evening followed by the use of LLINs during bedtime at community level has significantly reduced malaria infection. The finding has strong implication particularly in areas where malaria vectors feed mainly in the evening before bedtime. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01160809.

N2  - Herbicides were introduced in the 1950s, and since then, there has been an increase in herbicide-resistant weeds. This is apparent from the multiple (503) literature reviews on herbicide resistance worldwide. In Africa, there are few, if any, reviews on herbicide-resistant weeds, even though herbicide-resistant weeds affect sustainable agriculture by decreasing the quantity and quality of food production. In this study, articles sourced from the Scopus database were reviewed. Articles related to herbicide resistance, with a special emphasis on articles that applied herbicides to weeds and investigated the mechanisms of said resistance, were included. The results showed that there was multiple collaboration between Kenya, South Africa, Ethiopia, France, the USA, Spain, Italy, and Germany to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance and weed control strategies. Numerous keywords of interest, such as Lolium, glyphosate, and acetolactate synthase (ALS), appeared consistently in the literature. There are a total of 14 weed species (six monocots and eight dicots) in Africa that are resistant to six of the 31 known sites of action. Out of the 54 countries, only five have reported herbicide-resistant weeds. Resistance was due to target-site and non-target-site resistance mechanisms. However, one monocot (Lolium rigidum) and two dicots (Glebionis coronaria and Plantago lanceolata) from Tunisia and South Africa that are resistant to ALS and photosystem I inhibitors were not reported on the International Survey of Herbicide-Resistant Weeds database. Urgent weed control strategies are needed to stop the spread of resistance alleles. However, no one strategy will be effective unless a diversified approach, such as integrated weed management (IWM), is adopted to curb the spread of resistance alleles. © 2023

N2  - The effectiveness of extracting p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDE from aged contaminated soil samples by means of pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) was evaluated. Two soil samples, which were contaminated more than 10 years ago, were used in the investigation. The static extraction time was optimised and then validated against the total sum of target analytes obtained from multiple sequential extractions. The PLE results were also compared with Soxhlet extraction (SOX). PLE for 3×10 min at 100 °C was proven to be more exhaustive than SOX in the determination of p,p′-DDE from both soil samples. In the case of p,p′-DDT, PLE was found to be equally as exhaustive as SOX. Additionally, most of the previous PLE investigations used hazardous organic solvents such as n-hexane, toluene and dichloromethane mixed with acetone, whereas in this investigation the less toxic solvent combination n-heptane/acetone has been employed. © Springer-Verlag 2006.

N2  - The desert locust upsurge in the Horn of Africa over 2019–2021 led to a total of 1.6 million ha being treated with broad-spectrum organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides in Ethiopia and Kenya, while insect growth regulators and the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum were applied in Somalia. Environmental monitoring was largely absent, with limited surveys conducted in Kenya and Ethiopia. Overdosing of fenitrothion of a 960 g/L formulation in Kenya led to non-target mortality, including birds and honeybees. In Ethiopia, chlorpyrifos and malathion applications coincided with a honey production decline of 78% in 2020 compared to pre-upsurge levels. The use of M. acridum on nearly 253,000 ha was a breakaway from previous campaigns, in which its successful application in Somalia against both hopper bands and swarms shows that the persistent and pervasive use of organophosphate insecticides can no longer be justified. Furthermore, future procurement of organophosphate insecticides and possibly insect growth regulators could become increasingly problematic due to measures enacted by the European Union. It is recommended that the complementary impact of M. acridum and bird predation on locusts should be considered in an integrated management approach for both swarm and hopper control. © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Vector control is the main intervention in malaria control and elimination strategies. However, the development of insecticide resistance is one of the major challenges for controlling malaria vectors. Anopheles arabiensis populations in Ethiopia showed resistance against both DDT and the pyrethroid deltamethrin. Although an L1014F target-site resistance mutation was present in the voltage gated sodium channel of investigated populations, the levels of resistance indicated the presence of additional resistance mechanisms. In this study, we used genome-wide transcriptome profiling by RNAseq to assess differentially expressed genes between three deltamethrin and DDT resistant An. arabiensis field populations - Asendabo, Chewaka and Tolay - and two susceptible strains - Sekoru and Mozambique. RESULTS: Both RNAseq analysis and RT-qPCR showed that a glutathione-S-transferase, gstd3, and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, cyp6p4, were significantly overexpressed in the group of resistant populations compared to the susceptible strains, suggesting that the enzymes they encode play a key role in metabolic resistance against deltamethrin or DDT. Furthermore, a gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that expression changes of cuticle related genes were strongly associated with insecticide resistance. Although this did not translate in increased thickness of the procuticle, a higher cuticular hydrocarbon content was observed in a resistant population. CONCLUSION: Our transcriptome sequencing of deltamethrin and DDT resistant An. arabiensis populations from Ethiopia suggests non-target site resistance mechanisms and paves the way for further investigation of the role of cuticle composition in insecticide resistance of malaria vectors. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, and children are especially vulnerable. In 2019, an estimated 409,000 people died of malaria, most (274,000) were young children and 94% of the cases and deaths were in Africa. Prior studies in Ethiopia focused on the adult population and high transmission areas. Hence, this study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of malaria in children under five years in low transmission areas. METHOD: A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 585 under-five children who attended public health facilities in the Wogera district from September to October, 2017. Health facilities were selected by stratified cluster sampling, and systematic random sampling was held to select study participants from the selected facilities. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify correlates of malaria. RESULT: Of 585 children who provided blood samples, 51 (8.7%) had malaria. The predominant Plasmodium species were P. falciparum 33 (65%) and P. vivax 18 (35%). Regularly sleeping under long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLIN) was associated with decreased odds of malaria (AOR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.09), and an increased odds of malaria was observed among children who live in households with stagnant water in the compound (AOR = 6.7, 95% CI: 3.6-12.6) and children who stay outdoors during the night (AOR = 5.5, 95% CI: 2.7-11.1). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malaria in the study population was high. Environmental and behavioral factors related to LLIN use remain potential determinants of malaria. Continued public health interventions targeting proper utilization of bed nets, drainage of stagnant water, and improved public awareness about reducing the risk of insect bites have the potential to minimize the prevalence of malaria and improve the health of children.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality among school-age children (SAC) in sub-Saharan Africa. SAC account for more than 60% of the reservoir of malaria transmission, but they are given less emphasis in prioritizing malaria prevention interventions. This study was aimed at assessing the ownership of long-lasting insecticide treated bed nets (LLINs), its utilization and factors associated with ownership of LLINs by households and LLINs utilization among SAC in malaria-prone areas of Dara Mallo and Uba Debretsehay districts in Southern Ethiopia, October to December 2019. METHODS: This study is part of a baseline assessment in a cluster-randomized controlled trial. The data was collected through interview and observation, following a structured questionnaire, of 2261 SAC households. Univariable and multivariable multilevel logistic regressions were used to assess the association between LLINs ownership and utilization and potential predictor variables. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the strength and statistical significance of association. RESULTS: The ownership of at least one LLIN by households of SAC was about 19.3% (95% CI 17.7-21.0%) but only 10.3% % (95% CI 7.7-13.7%) of these households had adequate access of bed nets to the household members. Ownership of bed net was marginally affected by living in semi-urban area (adjusted OR = 2.6; 95% CI 1.0-6.9) and occupational status of the household head being a civil servant (adjusted OR = 2.7; 95% CI 0.9-7.9). About 7.8% (95% CI 6.7-10.0%) of all SAC participated in the study and 40.4% (95% CI 57.4-66.7%) of children in households owning at least one LLIN passed the previous night under LLIN. LLIN utilization by SAC conditional to presence of at least one net in the household was significantly correlated with education level of mother above grade 6 (adjusted OR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.3-9.3) and the household size to bed net ratio less than or equal to 2 (adjusted OR = 20.7; 95% CI 4.7-132.5). CONCLUSION: Ownership of bed net was lower than universal coverage of at least one bed net for two individuals. It is important to monitor replacement needs and educate mothers with low education level with their SAC on the benefit of consistent utilization of bed nets.

N2  - BACKGROUND: More than 75% of the total of Ethiopia is malarious. Therefore, malaria is a leading public health problem in Ethiopia. This study aims to identify socio-economic, geographic and demographic factors contributing to the spread of malaria and is based on the results of a malaria Rapid Diagnosis Test survey. METHODS: The data used in this study originates from the baseline malaria indicator survey, conducted in the Amhara, Oromiya and Southern Nation Nationalities and People (SNNP) regions of Ethiopia from December 2006 to January 2007. The study applies the method of generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) to analyse data. The response variable is the presence or absence of malaria, using the malaria Rapid Diagnosis Test (RDT). RESULTS: The results provide an improved insight into the distribution of malaria in relation to the age of affected people, the altitude, the total number of rooms, the total number of mosquito nets, family size, and the number of months that their rooms have been sprayed. The results confirm that positive malaria RDT test results are high for children under 15 years and for older persons. Gender, source of drinking water, time needed to fetch water, toilet facilities, main materials used for the construction of walls, floors and roofs, and use of mosquito nets were all found to have a significant impact on the results of the malaria rapid diagnosis test. CONCLUSION: The result of the analysis identifies poor socio-economic conditions as a major contributing factor or determinant for the spread of malaria. With the correct use of mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying with insecticide and other preventative measures, the incidence of malaria could be decreased. In addition, improving housing conditions is a means to reduce the risk of malaria. Other measures such as creating awareness of the use of mosquito nets, indoor residual spraying with insecticide, and malaria transmission, can lead to a further reduction in the number of malaria cases.

N2  - There is a general drive to reduce pesticide use owing to the potential negative effects of pesticides on the environment and human health. The EU Commission, for example, through its “Farm to Fork Strategy,” has proposed to decrease the use of hazardous chemical pesticides by 50% by 2030. In addition, smallholder farmers in low-income countries do not always follow pesticide safety precautions. This necessitates the introduction of low-risk crop protection strategies also suited for these farmers. Agricultural biologicals can substitute for, or at least partially replace hazardous chemical pesticides. While the market for and use of biologicals is growing quickly in industrialized countries, this practice remains limited in sub-Saharan Africa. To understand the reason behind the low adoption of biologicals, this study examined the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward biologicals among 150 smallholder farmers in the Chole district in Ethiopia. All farmers used chemical pesticides and/or inorganic fertilizers to protect crops, improve yields, and comply with government regulations. The use of biologicals was, however, restricted to one group of biologicals, bio-fertilizers, which approximately 60% of farmers used, and no use of biologicals for plant protection was reported. Even though the understanding of the concept of biologicals was deemed high among respondents, the majority (90%) did not identify biologicals as safer alternatives to conventional agricultural inputs. More than half of the respondents (54%) did not recommend biologicals as safer alternatives to their colleagues. Nevertheless, even if the responding farmers did not perceive biologicals as risk-free, they had a positive attitude towards biologicals when it came to producing healthy food and increasing crop yields and incomes. In comparison to the positive attitude, farmers’ knowledge and practice of biologicals were generally low; thus, efforts are needed to create awareness among farmers. © 2024

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ethiopia is a Sub-Saharan African country with a high annual malaria case count, owing to the majority of the country's geography favoring vector rearing. As part of the country's prevention-based health policy, substantial efforts have been made to control and prevent malaria transmission. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria and the associated factors in the community of Mizan-Aman and its catchment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September to October 2021, a community-based cross-sectional survey was undertaken among the communities of Mizan-Aman town and its catchment area in Southwest Ethiopia. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data, as well as a capillary blood sample from each study participant. Epi-data manager (v4.0.2.101) was used to enter the data and analyzed by SPSS version 25.0. A statistical significance was set at a P value of <0.05. RESULT: The study comprised a total of 412 people, of which 87 (21.1%) tested positive for malaria parasites, with a greater prevalence reported among those aged 25 to 34 years (5.8%). Individuals who lived near stagnant water were more likely to become infected with the malaria parasite (AOR = 8.996, 95% CI: 5.087-15.908) compared to those who lived further away, in warm climates, and those who did not use insecticide-treated bed nets were more susceptible to malaria parasite infection (AOR = 4.647, 95% CI: 1.257-17.184) compared to those who did use ITN and With (AOR = 0.466, 95% CI: 0.218-0.996 and AOR = 0.352, 95% CI: 0.206-0.604); participants with a history of antimalarial medication appear to have a protective function against malaria infection, respectively. CONCLUSION: The overall malaria prevalence in this study was 87 (21.1%), demonstrating that malaria remains a significant concern to the populations in the study area, with Plasmodium falciparum accounting for the vast majority of cases.

N2  - Following substantial decline in malaria burden in Ethiopia, the country is planning to eliminate malaria in certain low transmission settings by 2020. To evaluate the attainability of this goal in-depth examination of malaria parasite carriage at community level is necessary. This study was, therefore, aimed at assessing the current situation of malaria in relation to ongoing control interventions in Jiga area, Jabi Tehnan District in northwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional household (HH) survey was conducted in November-December 2013. Out of 2,574 HHs (11,815 people) in the entire Jabi Tehnan District, 392 (accommodating 1911 people) were randomly selected from three purposely selected villages. One randomly selected member from each selected HH was tested for malaria using rapid diagnostic test (mRDT). All participants tested for malaria (n = 392) were afebrile (axillary temperature <37.5°C). Eleven individuals (2.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI):1.2-4.4%) were found to be mRDT positive. Most HHs (95.9%, 95% CI: 93.5-97.5%) had at least 1 long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN). Insecticide residual spraying (IRS) coverage the last six months was 85.5% (95% CI: 82.0-88.9%). Malaria prevalence remains unexpectedly high despite high HH coverage of control interventions.

N2  - The effect of stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis) on yield and yield components of three common wheat cultivars was studied in 2002 and 2003 in Bale highlands, Ethiopia. The objectives were to quantify amount of loss in yield and yield components incurred by stripe rust on common wheat, and assess the relationship between stripe rust and yield. Different severity levels were created by varying triademefon spray intervals. Stripe rust significantly affected grain yield, kernels per spike (NKPS) and thousand kernels weight (TKW) of the susceptible Wabe cultivar. Losses of 3819kg ha-1 (71%) grain yield, 21.5 (35%) NKPS and 13.9g (37%) TKW occurred on Wabe. Each unit increase in stripe rust severity resulted in yield reduction of 41-47kg ha-1 at Agarfa. The study indicated that stripe rust causes intolerable high yield loss in common wheat production and the importance of using resistant cultivars and applying fungicide on susceptible cultivars.

N2  - Malaria is a fatal disease among children in malaria-prone locations such as Addis Zemen and Woreta because of their weak immune systems. Despite the severity of the disease in children, the majority of research conducted in Ethiopia has focused on adult populations rather than children. Furthermore, there is no data on malaria prevalence, risk factors, or parasite density among children in the Addis Zemen and Woreta catchment areas. Therefore, this study was aimed at filling the above gap in the study area. About 422 children were enrolled in the study by systematic sampling technique. A capillary blood sample was collected from each child to do blood film. The overall prevalence of malaria among children attending South Gonder health institutions was 14.7%. The majority of parasite density was moderate parasitemia followed by low parasitemia, giving 71.0% and 16.0%, respectively. Malaria parasite infection was linked to a history of malaria and the presence of stagnant water near a home, but utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets was found to be protective against the infection. Therefore, health education should be strengthened on proper utilization of bed nets, indoor residual spraying, removing stagnant water by discarding old tires that may collect rainwater, and removing debris from streams so streams flow more freely.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying (IRS) is the application of insecticide to the interior walls of household structures that often serve as resting sites for mosquito vectors of malaria. Human exposure to malaria vectors is reduced when IRS involves proper application of pre-determined concentrations of the active ingredient specific to the insecticide formulation of choice. The impact of IRS can be affected by the dosage of insecticide, spray coverage, vector behavior, vector susceptibility to insecticides, and the residual efficacy of the insecticide applied. This report compiles data on the residual efficacy of insecticides used in IRS campaigns implemented by the United States President's Malaria Initiative (PMI)/United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in 17 African countries and compares observed length of efficacy to ranges proposed in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Additionally, this study provides initial analysis on variation of mosquito mortality depending on the surface material of sprayed structures, country spray program, year of implementation, source of tested mosquitoes, and type of insecticide. METHODS: Residual efficacy of the insecticides used for PMI/USAID-supported IRS campaigns was measured in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The WHO cone bioassay tests were used to assess the mortality rate of mosquitoes exposed to insecticide-treated mud, wood, cement, and other commonly used housing materials. Baseline tests were performed within weeks of IRS application and follow-up tests were continued until the mortality of exposed mosquitoes dropped below 80% or the program monitoring period ended. Residual efficacy in months was then evaluated with respect to WHO guidelines that provide suggested ranges of residual efficacy for insecticide formulations recommended for use in IRS. Where the data allowed, direct comparisons of mosquito mortality rates were then made to determine any significant differences when comparing insecticide formulation, country, year, surface type, and the source of the mosquitoes used in testing. RESULTS: The residual efficacy of alpha-cypermethrin ranged from 4 to 10 months (average = 6.4 months), with no reported incidents of underperformance when compared to the efficacy range provided in WHO guidelines. Deltamethrin residual efficacy results reported a range of 1 to 10 months (average = 4.9 months), with two instances of underperformance. The residual efficacy of bendiocarb ranged from 2 weeks to 7 months (average = 2.8 months) and failed to achieve proposed minimum efficacy on 14 occasions. Lastly, long-lasting pirimiphos-methyl efficacy ranged from 2 months to 9 months (average = 5.3 months), but reported 13 incidents of underperformance. CONCLUSIONS: Much of the data used to determine application rate and expected efficacy of insecticides approved for use in IRS programs are collected in controlled laboratory or pilot field studies. However, the generalizability of the results obtained under controlled conditions are limited and unlikely to account for variation in locally sourced housing materials, climate, and the myriad other factors that may influence the bio-efficacy of insecticides. Here, data are presented that confirm the variation in residual efficacy observed when monitoring household surfaces sprayed during PMI/USAID-supported IRS campaigns. All insecticides except alpha-cypermethrin showed evidence of failing to meet the minimum range of residual efficacy proposed in WHO criteria at least once. However, this initial effort in characterizing program-wide insecticide bio-efficacy indicates that some insecticides, such as bendiocarb and pirimiphos-methyl, may be vulnerable to variations in the local environment. Additionally, the comparative analysis performed in this study provides evidence that mosquito mortality rates differ with respect to factors including: the types of insecticide sprayed, surface material, geographical location, year of spraying, and tested mosquitoes. It is, therefore, important to locally assess the residual efficacy of insecticides on various surfaces to inform IRS programming.

N2  - Malaria parasites are transmitted to humans by infectious female Anopheles mosquitoes. Chemical-insecticide-based mosquito control has been successful in reducing the burden of malaria. However, the emergence of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors and concerns about the effect of the chemicals on the environment, human health, and non-target organisms present a need for new or alternative vector control intervention tools. Biocontrol methods using aquatic invertebrate predators have emerged as a potential alternative and additional tool to control mosquito populations. Ecological control specifically makes use of species insights for improving the physical habitat conditions of competitors and predators of vectors. A first step towards this is to gain knowledge on the predation potential of several typically present macroinvertebrates. Hence, this study aimed at (1) examining the influence of the predation of hemipterans on the number of emerging adult mosquitoes and (2) detecting Anopheles mosquito DNA in the gut of those predators. The prey and predators were collected from a range of water bodies located in the Gilgel Gibe watershed, southwest Ethiopia. A semi-field study was carried out using mesocosms which were constructed using plastic containers mimicking the natural aquatic habitat of immature Anopheles mosquitoes. Adult mosquitoes that emerged from the mesocosms were collected using a mechanical aspirator. At the end of the experiment, predators were withdrawn from the mesocosms and identified to genus level. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was employed to identify sibling species of Anopheles gambiae s.l. and to detect Anopheles mosquito DNA in the gut of the predators. Data were analysed using R software. Giant water bugs (belostomatids) were the most aggressive predators of Anopheles larvae, followed by backswimmers (notonectids) and water boatmen (corixids). All female Anopheles gambiae s.l. emerged from the mesocosms were identified as Anopheles arabiensis. Anopheles arabiensis DNA was detected in the gut content of hemipteran specimens analysed from the three families. The number of the adult mosquitoes emerging from the mesocosms was affected by the presence of predators. The findings of this study provide evidence of the potential use of aquatic macroinvertebrate predators as biocontrol agents against immature Anopheles mosquitoes and their potential to be considered as a component of integrated vector management for insecticide resistance and the combined restoration of aquatic ecosystems via smart ecological engineering.

N2  - The aim of this investigation was to identify honeybee flora species, identify the constraints and opportunities of honey production in three purposively selected districts of North Wollo, Amhara, Ethiopia from September to November 2021. In total, 384 beekeepers were purposively selected for the interview based on accessibility and beekeeping potentials. Structured and semi-structured questionnaires, key informant interview and focal group discussions were used for data collection. Beekeepers indicated that the major source of bee colony was buying, catching swarm and gift from others with decreasing order. Beekeepers kept their bee colony in the backyard area. They keep traditional, movable frame and top bar hive, respectively, in descending order. Majority of the beekeepers follow traditional production systems. Twenty-nine honeybee flora species and twelve poisonous plants are also identified. Use of agrochemicals, lack of beekeeping equipment, diseases, pests and predators were the main challenges to beekeeping identified in the study area. Conversely, the suitability of an environment with different agro-ecology, the availability of diversified honeybee flora and the attractive price of honey are the best-observed opportunities to increase honey production and productivity. In conclusion, great attention should be given to training and extension programs for beekeepers focusing on honeybee management, pest and predator prevention, and/or control methods. Supporting beekeeping equipments, strict rules and regulations on the use of agrochemicals should be necessary. Further research should be done on the abundance of honey bee flora and the level and effect of poisonous honeybee floras in order to increase the productivity and income of beekeepers. © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the magnitude of malaria and its associated risk factors in urban, Batu town, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. METHODS: This health-facility based prospective cross-sectional study enrolled 356 febrile malaria patients to assess risk factors associated with malaria infection. RESULTS: An overall positivity rate of 17.13% (61/356) for malaria infection was observed. Among the malaria-positive patients, 50.8% (31/61) of them were positive for Plasmodium vivax, 45.90% (28/61) were positive for Plasmodium falciparum, and 3.3% (2/61) had mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. vivax. Logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals who possessed insecticide-treated net (Odds ratio [OR] = 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.194, 0.743]) and whose houses were sprayed with insecticides (OR = 0.18, 95% CI [0.097, 0.34]) were significantly less likely to have a malaria infection. Individuals living closer to stagnant water had a significantly greater chance of malaria infection than those who lived a distance from stagnant water (OR = 0.34, 95% CI [0.19, 0.59]). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed that malaria remains a public health problem in the urban area of Batu town, which suggests that the same might be true for other urban areas in the country.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite being preventable, malaria remains an important public health problem. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control has plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century. Researchers and policymakers are therefore exploring alternative and supplementary malaria vector control tools. Research in 1900 indicated that modification of houses may be effective in reducing malaria: this is now being revisited, with new research now examining blocking house mosquito entry points or modifying house construction materials to reduce exposure of inhabitants to infectious bites. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of house modifications on malaria disease and transmission. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase (OVID); Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CAB) Abstracts (Web of Science); and the Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database (LILACS), up to 1 November 2019. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), and the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/) to identify ongoing trials up to the same date. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, including cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), cross-over studies, and stepped-wedge designs were eligible, as were quasi-experimental trials, including controlled before-and-after studies, controlled interrupted time series, and non-randomized cross-over studies. We only considered studies reporting epidemiological outcomes (malaria case incidence, malaria infection incidence or parasite prevalence). We also summarised qualitative studies conducted alongside included studies. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. We used risk ratios (RR) to compare the effect of the intervention with the control for dichotomous data. For continuous data, we presented the mean difference; and for count and rate data, we used rate ratios. We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Six cRCTs met our inclusion criteria, all conducted in sub-Saharan Africa; three randomized by household, two by village, and one at the community level. All trials assessed screening of windows, doors, eaves, ceilings or any combination of these; this was either alone, or in combination with eave closure, roof modification or eave tube installation (a "lure and kill" device that reduces mosquito entry whilst maintaining some airflow). In two trials, the interventions were insecticide-based. In five trials, the researchers implemented the interventions. The community implemented the interventions in the sixth trial. At the time of writing the review, two of the six trials had published results, both of which compared screened houses (without insecticide) to unscreened houses. One trial in Ethiopia assessed screening of windows and doors. Another trial in the Gambia assessed full screening (screening of eaves, doors and windows), as well as screening of ceilings only. Screening may reduce clinical malaria incidence caused by Plasmodium falciparum (rate ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.82; 1 trial, 184 participants, 219.3 person-years; low-certainty evidence; Ethiopian study). For malaria parasite prevalence, the point estimate, derived from The Gambia study, was smaller (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17; 713 participants, 1 trial; moderate-certainty evidence), and showed an effect on anaemia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42, 0.89; 705 participants; 1 trial, moderate-certainty evidence). Screening may reduce the entomological inoculation rate (EIR): both trials showed lower estimates in the intervention arm. In the Gambian trial, there was a mean difference in EIR between the control houses and treatment houses ranging from 0.45 to 1.50 (CIs ranged from -0.46 to 2.41; low-certainty evidence), depending on the study year and treatment arm. The Ethiopian trial reported a mean difference in EIR of 4.57, favouring screening (95% CI 3.81 to 5.33; low-certainty evidence). Pooled analysis of the trials showed that individuals living in fully screened houses were slightly less likely to sleep under a bed net (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; 2 trials, 203 participants). In one trial, bed net usage was also lower in individuals living in houses with screened ceilings (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.95; 1 trial, 135 participants). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the two trials published to date, there is some evidence that screening may reduce malaria transmission and malaria infection in people living in the house. The four trials awaiting publication are likely to enrich the current evidence base, and we will add these to this review when they become available.

N2  - The main objective of this study was to investigate Combination level and Role of Indigenous and Modern Soil Conservation Practices in the case of Yayo District, Ilubabor zone, southwest Ethiopia. Cross-sectional research designs with both qualitative and quantitative research approaches were employed. Two stage sampling procedures with combination of purposive and simple random sampling procedures were used to select 210 sample household heads for the study. Household survey questionnaires, key informant interview, focus group discussion and field observation were used to collect the data. Binary logistic model was used to identify determinant factors of farmers’ decision to adopt soil conservation practices. The finding of the study showed that contour plowing, farmyard manure and traditional cut-off drain were the most practiced indigenous soil conservation practices. Improved crop seed, use of chemical fertilizer and insecticide and pesticide were the major improved/modern/ soil conservation practiced performed by household of the study areas. Insubstantial level of integration between indigenous and modern soil conservation practices were another finding of the study. The result also indicated as decrease soil erosion, improve income, improve water availability, and increase crop & livestock productivity were to the major contributions of integrating indigenous and modern soil conservation practiced in the study area.. The result of binary logistic regression analysis showed as livestock ownership, distances to farm plot, access to credit services and extension services were significantly (p<0.05) affect household decisions to adopt soil conservation practices. Therefore, farmers should be adopting profitable and sustainable soil management practice and integrate indigenous with modern soil management practices. © 2024The Authors.

N2  - The long-term intensive production system employed in the Sugar Estates in Ethiopia, characterized by monoculture, preharvest burning, and excessive tillage, has led to soil degradation with a concomitant decline in sugarcane yield. Therefore, a study was conducted at Wonji-Shoa Sugar Estate (WSSE) with the objective of evaluating the effectiveness of different green manuring plant species and cane stool destruction methods (SDMs) in improving cane yield. To that end, seven green manure plant species (sunn-hemp, lablab, cowpea, soybean, mungbean, dhaincha, and sugarcane trash) were evaluated under three SDMs (cultivating-out, spraying-out with herbicide, and maintaining the stool as it is) using a split-plot design. The experimental fields were established on two major soil types, with green manure crops incorporated into the soil before planting the sugarcane. The dry matter production and nitrogen contribution of the green manure plants, as well as the height, population, diameter, and yields of sugarcane, were determined and subsequently subjected to statistical and economic analysis. The results showed that cowpea, followed by lablab, dhaincha, and sunn hemp, were the most effective green manures in terms of improving cane performance, with up to 17-20 % yield advantage and 21-40 % net economic benefits over the control treatment. Additionally, the spraying-out MSD was as effective as the cultivating-out MSD, but both outperformed maintaining the stool. In conclusion, utilizing these green manuring crops in combination with the spraying-out SDM presents notable advantages for improved cane yield and enhanced economic benefits in a sustainable manner. Adoption of these practices, therefore, holds significant potential for reversing the constantly declining sugarcane yields at WSSE.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Liver cirrhosis is a global health problem due to a large number of disability-associated life years and mortality. However, evidence is scarce on its causes in Eastern-Ethiopia, a place where there is a high prevalence of liver cirrhosis of unknown etiology. This study attempted to identify the risk factors related to liver cirrhosis in the area. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from January 2020 to July 2021. Following diagnoses using an ultrasound-based cirrhosis scale, a total of 127 cases were identified and compared with 253 control patients. A structured questionnaire and data abstraction form were used to collect demographic, lifestyle, and clinical information. A blood sample was also taken from each participant for clinical chemistry, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus tests as well as for an aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)) albumin adduct (AF-alb) assay. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine predictors of liver cirrhosis. RESULTS: AF-alb levels were detected in 75% of the cases and 64% of the controls, with a median (IQR) level of 11 pg/mg (5.5-25) and 7.0 pg/mg (4.3-20.5), respectively (p<0.05). Moreover, the number of subjects with high AF-alb levels (≥8.6 pg/mg) was greater in cases (45%, p<0.05)) than controls (28%). Age ≥55 years (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=0.4; 95% CI: 0.2, 0.8), being a farmer (AOR= 3.0; 95% CI: 1.5, 6.0), family history of liver disease (AOR= 2.9; 95% CI: 1.1, 7.9), HBV seropositivity (AOR=4.0; 95% CI: 1.9, 8.8), and exposure to high levels of AF-alb (AOR=2.0; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.7) were significantly associated with liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: This study found a strong link between AFB(1) exposure and liver cirrhosis. Mitigation of aflatoxin exposure and a better understanding of additional environmental risk factors like pesticides may be necessary to reduce the disease burden in Ethiopia.

N2  - High soil erosion rates, sediment transport, and loss of agricultural nutrients have been caused by poor land-use practices and management systems. This study mainly focuses on sediment yield modeling and evaluation of best management practices of the Daketa sub-basin using the SWAT model. Calibration and validation were done using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in Daketa sub-basin. The coefficient of determination (R2), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (ENS), and percent bias (PBIAS) were used to evaluate the model performance. During the calibration and validation, monthly sediment yield R2 values of 0.80 and 0.85, ENS values of 0.74 and 0.81, and PBIAS values of 0.0829 and 0.124 were obtained. The mean annual sediment yield of the Daketa watershed is 14.43 t/ha/year. Basin management scenarios were applied to reduce sediment production in the sub-basins. Four scenarios were developed such as (i) baseline, (ii) 5 and 10 m wide filter strip, (iii) waterway grass, and (iv) terraces to select the best management practices in the basin. The result shows that grassy waterway reduces sediment yield with an efficiency of 74.6% relative to the baseline scenario. Generally, the results indicated that grass waterways have a high potential for reducing the volume and velocity of runoff, sediments, and agrochemicals from agricultural catchments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

N2  - Pesticide use has increased in the Lake Tana sub-basin due to increased agricultural activity, potentially endangering nontargeted organisms. To assess its potential impact on fish health and fish-consuming human populations, pesticide concentrations in the fillet and liver tissue of three fish species, namely Labeobarbus megastoma, Labeobarbus tsanensis, and Oreochromis niloticus, were investigated in Lake Tana. Fish samples were taken from the lake near the rivers of Ribb and Gumara, which flow through agricultural areas where considerable amounts of pesticides have been applied. A total of 96 fish samples were collected. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) revealed the presence of ten pesticides. Pyrimethanil was frequently detected in 96% of liver and 65% of fillet samples at a median concentration of 33.9 µg kg−1 and 19.7 µg kg−1, respectively. The highest concentration of pyrimethanil was found in L. megastoma (1850.0 µg kg−1). Labeobarbus megastoma also had the highest concentration of oxamyl (507.0 µg kg−1) and flazasulfuron (60.1 µg kg−1) detected in the liver tissue. The highest concentration of carbaryl (56.5 µg kg−1) was found in the liver tissue of O. niloticus. Fish tissue samples from the two study sites contained pyrimethanil, oxamyl, carbaryl, and flazasulfuron. Only pyrimethanil showed a statistically significant difference between the two sites and the species L. megastoma and L. tsanensis. The amounts of pesticides found in the fish species pose no direct risk to the health of fish consumer human population. However, the results show that the lake ecosystem needs immediate attention and regular monitoring of the rising pesticide usage in the lake watershed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

N2  - Background: Pesticide applications can have unwanted health consequences. Aim: To study cholinesterase levels in farm workers with varying exposure to chemical pesticide. Methods: Plasma cholinesterase (PChE) w as measured in workers at two Ethiopian farms. A standard questionnaire adopted from the British Medical Research Council was used to determine the health status of the subjects. Results: A total of 82 farm workers and 47 controls participated in the study. While the mean values of plasma cholinesterase were generally lower in those exposed, this difference was only significant in the sprayers at Birr farm (P <0.05). In this group, four sprayers had cholinesterase activity lower than 50%. Conclusion: The sprayers in both farms were the most affected groups, suggesting that improved controls on workplace exposure to pesticide is required in these groups of workers. © The Author 2005.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is the leading cause of disease burden across the world, especially in African countries. Ethiopia has designed a five year (2011-2015) plan to cover 100% of the households in malarious areas with one insecticide treated net (ITN) for every two persons, and to raise consistent ITN utilization to at least 80%. However, evidence on ownership of ITN among malarious rural households in northwest Ethiopia is quite limited. Hence, the present study aimed at assessing ownership of ITN and associated factors among rural households at risk of malaria at Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site, northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross sectional re-census was carried out in Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site during peak malaria seasons from October to December, 2014. Data for 15,088 households at Dabat Health and Demographic Surveillance System site were used for the analysis. Descriptive measures and binary logistic regression were carried out. RESULTS: Among those who owned at least one ITN, 53.4% were living at an altitude >2500 m above sea level. However, out of households living at an altitude <2000 m above sea level, 15.8% (95% CI 14.4%, 17.3%) owned ITN at an average of 4.3 ± 2.1 persons per ITN. Of these, 69.5% (95% CI 64.7%, 74.1%) used the ITN. Among utilizing households at malarious areas, 23.7% prioritized pregnant women and 31.4% children to use ITN. The availability of radio receiver/mobile (AOR 1.60, 95%CI 1.08, 2.35) and secondary/above educational status of household member (AOR 1.54, 95%CI 1.19, 2.04) were predictors of ownership of ITN. CONCLUSION: Rural households at risk of malaria did not own a sufficient number of ITN though the utilization is promising. Moreover, prioritizing children and pregnant women to sleep under ITN remains public health problems. Programmers, partners and implementers should consider tailored intervention strategy stratified by altitude in distributing ITN. ITN distribution should also be accompanied by using exhaustive promotion strategies that consider people without access to any source of information, and educating households to prioritize pregnant and under five children to sleep under ITN.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is a serious, fatal disease, and a high-risk determinant for human health globally. Children, pregnant women, and migrants are vulnerable groups for malaria infection in African regions. Recently, malaria is an endemic disease in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of malaria and its determinant factors among the most vulnerable populations in Ethiopia. METHODS: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Semantic Scholar, and Scopus were used for searching articles published since the 2020 Gregorian calendar and onwards. All peer-reviewed Ethiopian journals, health institutions, and Universities were considered for article searching. A PRISMA flow chart and Endnote software were used for article screening, and to remove duplications, respectively. The modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for potential risk of bias assessments. The heterogeneity among the included studies was evaluated using the indicator of heterogeneity (I(2)). Egger's test and funnel plot were used to examine the possible publication bias. A random-effects analysis was used to assess the pooled prevalence of malaria, and its determinant factors with a 95% CI. The screening process, data extraction, and quality assessment were done independently, and any disagreements were resolved through discussions. RESULTS: A total of twelve studies were included in this study. The pooled malaria prevalence was 11.10% (95% CI: 6.10, 16.11). Stagnant water (AOR: 4.19, 95% CI: 2.47, 7.11), no insecticide-treated net utilization (AOR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.73, 5.73), and staying outdoors at night (AOR: 5.19, 95% CI: 2.08, 12.94) were the pooled estimated statistically risk factors for malaria prevalence. Whereas, insecticide-treated bed net utilization (AOR: 1.59, 95% CI: 0.23, 10.95) reduces the risk of malaria infection. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled prevalence of malaria is high among vulnerable populations. Creating awareness regarding utilization of insecticide-treated bed nets, and draining stagnant water from the environment are possible interventions to reduce the prevalence of malaria.

N2  - Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) is the most significant insect pest of chickpea in Ethiopia. Sole reliance on insecticide causes both human and environmental health problems. A common soil bacterium, Bacillus thuringiensis used as a bioinsecticide to control numerous Lepidopteran larvae. Therefore, indigenous isolates were collected, screened, tested for pathogenicity against H. armigera with a reference Bacillus. var. thuringiensis. From 121 soil samples collected, 23 Bacillus species were isolated and purified. Bt index ranged from 0.33 to 1.00 and the mean was 0.73 average Bt index. Absorbance values ranged from 0.46 to 0.98. Screening biotoxicity assay was conducted at the rate of 1 mL against 3rd instar larvae of H. armigera. Experiments were replicated three times; ten larvae were used per replicate and reputed thrice. Ten indigenous Bt isolates were screened based on larval mortality which ranged between 27.78% and 75.83% and LT50 values of 45.71–143.9 h. The highest mortality of 75.83% and LT50 of 45.71 h was recorded from reference Bt followed by indigenous Bt isolate KDL with mortality percentage of 69.16% and LT50 of 48.49 h. Statistically no significant difference was observed among the tested bacterial isolates. Biotoxicity assay was conducted at five concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2 mL. The LD50 and LD 90 values were 0.84–1.24 mL and 1.54–1.98 mL, respectively. The lowest LD50, 90 of 0.84 mL and 1.54 mL were recorded from KDL Bt isolate compared to reference Bt whose LD50 and LD90 were 0.84 mL and 1.66 mL. Results of Bt growth under varied values of temperature ranged from 15oC to 40 °C. All the Bt isolates showed growth at all the values of the tested temperatures with steady growth from 15 °C to 20 °C and uniform growth observed from 20 °C to 30 °C. After 35 °C, the growth of all the Bt isolates declined indicating that 30 °C–35 °C is the optimum growth temperature range. Protein content ranged from 0.43 to 0.97 (mg/mL). However, protein content and larval mortality was not linearly correlated. It was concluded that all the tested indigenous Bacillus isolates were virulent enough and identified as a promising candidate bioinsecticide against H. armigera. Hence, recommended for further intensive evaluations under greenhouse and field trails. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

N2  - BACKGROUND: Though school-aged children (SAC) are at high risk of malaria, they are the ones that benefit the least from malaria prevention measures. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of malaria prevention education (MPE) on insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) utilization and prompt diagnosis, reported incidence and treatment (PDAT) of malaria. Qualitative evaluation of the implementation of such interventions is vital to explain its effectiveness and will serve as guidance for future interventions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the implementation of the MPE in southern Ethiopia.  METHODS: The trial was registered in Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR202001837195738) on 21/01/2020. A descriptive qualitative study using semi-structured interview with participants of the MPE was conducted in January 2020 and January 2021. The collected data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically. The analysis of the data was supported by NVivo. RESULTS: The four themes identified after evaluation of MPE training were the setup of the training, challenges for the success of the training, anticipated challenges for practice as per the protocol and experienced immediate influences of the training. Participants appreciated the training: content covered, way of delivery and the mix of the participants. The context specific facilitators to bed net use were the collateral benefits of ITN and perceived at high risk of malaria while its barriers were quality and quantity of the bed nets, bed net associated discomforts, malaria health literacy and housing condition. Severeness of malaria symptoms and malaria health literacy were reported as both barriers and facilitators of the PDAT of malaria. The identified facilitators of PDAT of malaria were health professionals' attitude and exposure to MPE while its barriers were poverty, use of traditional medicine, health facility problems and Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION: Low attendance of parents in the training was the major challenge for the success of MPE. National malaria program should ensure the access to malaria prevention measures; and future studies using increased frequency of the intervention embedded with monitoring adherence to the intervention protocol shall be conducted to improve the gains from existing malaria interventions.

N2  - In Ethiopia, using pesticides to manage pests in the growing of fruits and vegetables is a standard practice. Various classes of pesticides have been approved to combat pests, but the majority of those in use now are outdated broad-spectrum insecticides with significant residual effects on crops of freshly eaten fruits and vegetables. This review reveals that Ethiopia's assessment of the residual pesticide level in fruits and vegetables has been lacking. According to the reviewed literature, crops that are often treated with pesticides in many countries have significant residual pesticide levels. However, Ethiopia has not adequately reported on this issue. Furthermore, due to a lack of knowledge regarding the impact of pesticide residues on human health, Ethiopians frequently use pesticides improperly to control pests in fruits and vegetables. The majority of consumers eat their fruits and vegetables unprocessed, without washing or cooking them first. To reduce the risk of pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables for consumer safety and to battle the health effects of toxic chemicals in humans, monitoring pesticide residues and raising awareness about the adverse effects of pesticides on humans are urgently needed. Before they may be registered and sold, pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables as well as in the environment must also undergo proper testing and evaluation. New pesticide generations that have fewer side effects on fruits and vegetables must also be developed. By washing, peeling, canning, or boiling fruits and vegetables before consumption, the detrimental effects of pesticide residues on human health can be minimized. © 2024 Yohannes Gelaye and Belete Negash.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pregnant women with asymptomatic malaria parasitemia are at increased risk of anaemia, stillbirth, miscarriage, and preterm delivery. The asymptomatic nature of the population makes diagnosis difficult, and there is generally a lack of urgency to address this specific outcome. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic malaria and associated factors among pregnant women in West Guji Zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 557 asymptomatic pregnant women in the West Guji Zone from February to March 2022. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect information on socio-demographic and obstetric characteristics. Approximately 2 milliliters of peripheral blood was collected for microscopy to identify species and parasite density. Epi-Data and SPSS were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Binary logistic regression was used to identify risk factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of malaria among asymptomatic pregnant women was 24.10% (95% CI: 20.55%-27.65%). The prevalence of Plasmodium vivax and falciparum prevalence was 73 (54.5%) and 61 (45.5%), respectively. Of the study subjects, 105 (78.4%) had mild parasitemia and 29 (21.6%) had moderate parasitemia. Pregnant women with Plasmodium infection were anaemic in two-thirds (66.5%) of cases. Living near standing water (AOR=2.6, 95% CI: 1.74-3.96), having a history of Plasmodium species infection (AOR=2.12, 95% CI: 1.36-3.31), not using indoor residual spraying (AOR=2.0, 95% CI: 1.32-3.14), and not using insecticide-treated bed nets (AOR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.02-2.55) were all factors that were significantly associated with asymptomatic infection. Pregnant women with Plasmodium infection had a significantly higher rate of anaemia than those who were not infected (OR = 6.31, p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Pregnant women had a significant prevalence of asymptomatic Plasmodium infection. Regular screening, appropriate treatment for those who test positive, and health education for pregnant women should be provided by the West Guji Zone Health Bureau.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Synthetic insecticides are employed in the widely-used currently favored malaria control techniques involving indoor residual spraying and treated bednets. These methods have repeatedly proven to be highly effective at reducing malaria incidence and prevalence. However, rapidly emerging mosquito resistance to the chemicals and logistical problems in transporting supplies to remote locations threaten the long-term sustainability of these techniques. Chinaberry (Melia azederach) extracts have been shown to be effective growth-inhibiting larvicides against several insects. Because several active chemicals in the trees' seeds have insecticidal properties, the emergence of resistance is unlikely. Here, we investigate the feasibility of Chinaberry as a locally available, low-cost sustainable insecticide that can aid in controlling malaria. Chinaberry fruits were collected from Asendabo, Ethiopia. The seeds were removed from the fruits, dried and crushed into a powder. From developmental habitats in the same village, Anopheles arabiensis larvae were collected and placed into laboratory containers. Chinaberry seed powder was added to the larval containers at three treatment levels: 5 g m(-2), 10 g m(-2) and 20 g m(-2), with 100 individual larvae in each treatment level and a control. The containers were monitored daily and larvae, pupae and adult mosquitoes were counted. This experimental procedure was replicated three times. RESULTS: Chinaberry seed powder caused an inhibition of emergence of 93% at the 5 g m(-2) treatment level, and 100% inhibition of emergence at the two higher treatment levels. The Chinaberry had a highly statistically significant larvicidal effect at all treatment levels (χ2 = 184, 184, and 155 for 5 g m(-2), 10 g m(-2) and 20 g m(-2), respectively; p < 0.0001 in all cases). In addition, estimates suggest that sufficient Chinaberry seed exists in Asendabo to treat developmental habitat for the duration of the rainy season and support a field trial. CONCLUSIONS: Chinaberry seed is a very potent growth-inhibiting larvicide against the major African malaria vector An. arabiensis. The seed could provide a sustainable additional malaria vector control tool that can be used where the tree is abundant and where An. arabiensis is a dominant vector. Based on these results, a future village-scale field trial using the technique is warranted.

N2  - Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) production in Ethiopia has been seriously constrained by the insect pest, Helicoverpa armigera. Insecticides have been used for decades to control this noxious pest. However, the restriction on chemical insecticides necessitates biological pest control alternatives. Therefore, the present study investigated the effectiveness of native Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) isolates against Helicoverpa armigera 3rd instar larvae. The treatments consisted of Bt concentrations at the LD90 values, whereas the control plots were sprayed with distilled water and a commercial Bt. var. thuringiensis product. The results revealed statistically (p< 0.05) significant differences between the native Bt isolates and the control plots. Post 1st, pre 2nd and post 2nd Bt sprayed larval populations counted per plant ranged from 0.8 ± 0.3–3.1 ± 0.1, 0.6 ± 0.1–3.6 ± 0.0 and 0.5 ± 0.1–3.6 ± 0.4, respectively. Pod damage (%) and grain yield (t/ha) ranged between 9.7 ± 3.1 and 47.5 ± 9.5, 1.0 ± 0.0 and 2.6 ± 0.5, respectively compared to 47.5 ± 9.5% pod damage and 1.0 ± 0.0 (t/ha) grain yield from the control plots. These results indicate the potential of these bio-insecticides in the management of chickpea pod borer. Future research in Ethiopia should focus on additional collection, screening, characterisation, and testing in field trials. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the major public health problems in developing countries like Ethiopia. Despite efforts to reduce the mortality and morbidity, the disease is still a prominent health problem in Ethiopia. This study, therefore, was undertaken to assess the prevalence of malaria and associated factors among symptomatic patients in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2020 among 210 febrile patients attending Hamusit Health Center, Northwest Ethiopia. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and factors perceived to be associated with Plasmodium infection. Questionnaire data was collected through face to face interview. Thin and thick blood films were prepared from capillary blood buffy coat samples. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Software version 20. RESULTS: Out of 210 malaria-suspected participants, 61 (29.0%) were confirmed to be infected by Plasmodium species. Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax monoinfections were detected in 41 (19.5%) and 10 (4.8%) participants, respectively. Mixed infection was detected in 10 (4.8%) participants. Female participants (AOR = 2.261; 95% CI: 1.118-4.571; P = 0.023) and those having family members with history of malaria (AOR =2.261; 95% CI: 1.264-5.340; P = 0.009) had higher odds of acquiring Plasmodium infection as compared to their counterparts. Using insecticide-treated bed net and draining stagnant water were the most commonly mentioned malaria prevention measures reported by 71.9% and 8.1% of the respondents, respectively. CONCLUSION: Malaria contributes significantly for febrile illnesses in the study area. Therefore, community mobilization should be strengthen in order to improve implementation of malaria control activities and, hence, reducing the prevalence.

N2  - Louseborne relapsing fever (LBRF) was once a cosmopolitan disease, but it now occurs only in the Horn of Africa. Recent cases in refugees to Europe made LBRF topical again. Crowded boarding houses and church dwellings in Ethiopia are analogous to the crowded air-raid shelters of World War II. Thus, we might learn from experiments the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine conducted during World War II. When the vector of Borrelia recurrentis (Pe-diculus humanus lice) was held away from the host for 10 days, 100% of nymphal and adult lice starved to death and 100% of eggs did not hatch. We hypothesize that holding infested clothes away from hosts in plastic shopping bags will kill enough lice to control LBRF in Ethiopia. Owning 2 sets of clothes might be useful; 1 set might be held in a plastic shopping bag for 10 days to kill lice and their eggs. © 2019, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

N2  - The proactive identification of asymptomatic patients and the mitigation of associated problems are essential to the elimination of malaria. For asymptomatic malaria and related variables among pregnant women in Ethiopia, there are no national pooled estimates. As a result, the goal of this study is to compile thorough and compelling data from several Ethiopian investigations. Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopes, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and African Journals Online were a few of the electronic resources that were accessed. The investigation included all observational studies. STATA version 15 was used to extract the data from the Microsoft Excel file and conduct the analysis. The estimated pooled prevalence of asymptomatic malaria among pregnant women was calculated using a random-effects model. An inverse variance index (I(2)) analysis was utilized to find heterogeneity. To assess the publication bias, funnel plots, and Egger's statistical tests were used. The study determined that the combined prevalence of asymptomatic malaria among pregnant women was 7.20 (95% confidence interval = 4.22, 10.18) and 4.69 (95% confidence interval = 2.77, 6.62) by microscopy and rapid diagnostic test, respectively. The presence of stagnant water near their home (odds ratio = 4.31; 95% confidence interval = 1.66, 11.20); not using insecticide-treated nets (odds ratio = 6.93; 95% confidence interval = 3.27, 14.71); the lack of indoor residual spray service (odds ratio = 2.68; 95% confidence interval = 1.63, 4.40); and the presence of pregnant women in their neighborhood (odds ratio = 3.14; 95% confidence interval = 1.4). This study showed that pregnant women have a high pooled prevalence of asymptomatic malaria. Women living in rural areas near stagnant water and those who never used insecticide-treated nets had a two-, four-, or six-fold higher prevalence of asymptomatic malaria, respectively. The use of advanced diagnostic techniques could produce a higher magnitude of the disease. For effective intervention toward elimination, active case detection at the community level is also advised.

N2  - 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid is a poisonous herbicide. Though poisoning reports from this compound are rare, there is a tendency toward increased use of it in the agrarian society of Ethiopia. We herein report a case of a young female farmer from rural Ethiopia who was admitted to a local hospital after presenting with loss of consciousness and excess oral secretions 2 hours after a suicidal ingestion of an unknown toxic agent. She was originally treated for organophosphate poisoning, and then transferred to Saint Peter's Hospital in Addis Ababa for more intensive care. There, ingestion of 2,4-D was confirmed, and she received supportive care, mechanical ventilation, and forced alkaline diuresis. Despite these interventions, she died several days later. Due to the similarity of some clinical signs with organophosphate poisoning in acute settings, there are possible missed cases of 2,4-D acid herbicide poisoning. No specific treatment is known, so a high index of suspicion for early detection, decontamination, and initiation of supportive care is crucial to improve survival after exposure. In addition, local policies on proper and controlled use of these herbicides are needed to improve awareness among users and prevent accidental and intentional exposures.

N2  - Pesticides are chemicals used to control different types of pests. Though pesticides played a role in improving the quantity and quality of production, they have been threatening ecosystems and posed effects on humans in different parts of the world. Unfortunately, there were no studies made about the effects of pesticide residues on ecosystems and consumers in the Fogera District of Amhara Region, Ethiopia. Hence, the main objective of this study was to understand the knowledge, attitude, and practices of respondents about the effects of pesticide residues on ecosystems and consumers. A cross-sectional survey complemented by focus group discussions and field observations was used to gather the required data for the study. The close-ended data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, logistic regressions, and independent t-test, and data from open-ended questions were grouped and summarized based on their similarities. The findings of the study confirmed that there was significant knowledge, attitude, and practices difference between farmers and consumers about the effects of pesticide residues on ecosystems and humans. Farmers used highly toxic pesticides to control pests and improve the glossiness of vegetables and khat. Though they didn't use the sprayed vegetables for their home consumption, some of the farmers deliberately supplied pesticide-sprayed vegetables without worrying about the negative effects of the pesticides on the consumers. There were also fishing practices from rivers after intoxicating the fish using the pesticide sprayed feed. This, in turn, might poison individuals who consume the fish. In general, pesticide application practices and consumption of pesticide-sprayed foodstuffs and surface water might pose serious health risks to ecosystems and humans. To minimize the negative effects of pesticides, rigorous awareness-raising on the effects and management of pesticides, enforcement of laws, delineation of the pesticide free buffer zone for waters, the establishment of a clear pesticide supply chain to the end users, ecosystem assessment and food safety monitoring schemes are highly required.

N2  - This study was aimed at examining the impacts of climate variability on vegetable production and nexus climate-smart agriculture technologies. The study was conducted on vegetable farmers along the little Akaki River in Addis Ababa. Field data was collected from 156 randomly selected vegetable farmers via semi-structured survey questions. Climate data from 1996 to 2020 was analysed using qualitative and quantitative descriptive statistics methods. The results of monthly and annual precipitation variability indicated a coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 23% to 73% and 49% to 98%, respectively. Seasonally, CV ranges between 34% and 99%, 50%–97%, and 20%–84% in Belg, Bega, and Kiremt, respectively. The results of respondents' perceptions indicated an increasing trend in temperature and precipitation variability. Vegetable urban farmers perceived an increase in the frequency of floods and rain falls (44.9%), drought frequency (13.5%), temperature (89.7%), and a decrease in the trend of vegetable productivity (86.5%) as the major impacts of climate variability. However, changing vegetable varieties (31.4%), early planting (26.9%), mixed farming (26.6%), late planting (5.1%), using agrochemicals (4.5%), and agroforestry (1.9%) are the major on-farm climates where smart agriculture technologies were identified for adaptation. Shift occupation (37.8%), nonadaptation (36.5%), and non-farm activations (24.4%) were employed by the farmers as off-farm adaptation options. In addition, vulnerability analysis indicated that the absence of direct access to the market, inadequate access to weather information, land fragmentation, and tenure complications are the major determinants of being vulnerable. Finally, high precipitation and temperature variability affect vegetable productivity. Practical Implications: Climate extreme phenomena are substantial pressures on urban agricultural production systems in risk-prone cities, where climate service challenges are rising globally (Sanfo et al., 2022; Kifle et al., 2022; Ebissa and Desta, 2022); besides, the requirement to produce more urban vegetables to feed residents, an ever-increasing and vulnerable group, is undeniable (Martinez et al., 2022). Additionally, climate variability and change threaten urban and pre-urban farmers’ livelihoods and agricultural farming, particularly in semi-arid areas in Africa (Magesa et al., 2023). Furthermore, 64 % of the world's poorest people lived in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020, which strongly requires the implementation of Sustainable Development Goals 1 (no poverty), 2 (zero hunger) and 11 (make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable) in the region (Magesa et al., 2023; Chitakira and Ngcobo, 2021; Degefu et al., 2021c). Thus, cities are exposure to compatible climate information services is vital for anticipating climate variability risks in vegetable production, optimizing the training of practitioners (urban farmers), and adapting to climate change through climate smart agriculture technologies (Degefu et al., 2021a; Chitakira and Ngcobo, 2021; Kifle et al., 2022). Moreover, it is compulsory to ascertain and analyze impact insights and their origins, vulnerabilities, and adaptive potential among urban farmers before beginning with the exercise of any given climate service to understand the demands of urban vegetable farmers and the possible exploitation of nexuses (Dendir and Simane, 2021). Conversely, in Ethiopia, the agriculture sector is identified as one of the sectors most vulnerable to climate change and vulnerability (Kifle et al., 2022). On top of these, the productivity and the concern of urban agriculture (vegetable production) is highly ignored and reduced the potential, productivity and suitability of ecological land (Kifle et al., 2022; Degefu et al., 2021b; Degefu et al., 2021c). Besides, the combined effect of climate variability, population pressure, and urban ecosystem dynamics reduced urban vegetable production and leads the farming community into a viscous of poverty circle and wor ens food security (Amberber et al., 2020; Degefu et al., 2021c). However, previous studies have revealed that the effectiveness of climate information services on urban ecosystems depends on (i) the ability of urban farmers to access, understand, and overcome institutional constraints (Kiplagat et al., 2022) (ii) the capacity of end-users to translate the information and knowledge into effective decision-making options (Dendir and Simane, 2021), and (iii) the capacity of end-users to translate the information and knowledge into effective decision-making options (Martinez et al., 2022). To that end, the disparity between the awareness of urban farmers and policymakers towards the benefits of CSA and their practices implies that indigenous knowledge-based research on CSA farming and land management technology should be conducted. Therefore, it is crucial to appreciate the practices and adoption of CSA at the city level to realise triple-win outcomes: increased productivity, enhanced resilience, and mitigating climate variability and change. © 2023 The Author(s)

N2  - Onion is a vital vegetable crop in Ethiopia, with significant economic and health benefits. However, its production trend is not consistent, with periods of increase and decrease; and its productivity in the country falls far below its potential. As a result, farmers are not yet fully benefited from onion production. Thus, this study was initiated to identify the factors influencing onion production in the Raya Kobo District of Amhara Regional State of Ethiopia. Data was collected from 189 onion-producing farmers through household surveys, and both descriptive and econometric techniques were used for analysis. The study found significant variation in onion production among farmers, with lower levels compared to national and international averages. Factors such as gender, education level, experience, labor force, land size, access to extension services, irrigation water, land plough frequency, and fertilizer availability positively impact onion production. However, excessive fertilizer use was found to have a negative effect. The study also identified challenges faced by farmers, including input shortages, high costs, diseases, labor issues, soil infertility, and storage knowledge gaps. The study recommends policymakers and stakeholders to utilize these findings to develop effective policies and interventions that can enhance onion production, benefiting farmers and improving the overall onion production.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of local residents about insecticide treated nets (ITNs) for malaria control in an endemic area of Ethiopia. METHODS: A descriptive cross-survey was conducted from July 2008 to September 2008. A structured questionnaire collecting sociodemographic, ITNs and malaria-related KAP information was administered to the representatives of households. SETTINGS: Azendabo town, Ethiopia. RESULTS: 84% of the inhabitants had awareness about malaria transmission; mosquito bites were identified correctly as the cause of malaria. 85.2% respondents indicated that mosquitoes bite at night. ITNs awareness level of inhabitants was 92.4%; however, just 57.8% of them own ITNs. 96.2% and 91.5% of the inhabitants indicated the foremost reasons for nonpossession of ITNs were due to unaffordability and nonavailability. Inhabitants average monthly income significantly associated with the ITNs ownership at p<0.05 and, however educational status of the respondents and ITNs ownership was not significant (p=0.1). CONCLUSION: Indeed, respondents had adequate knowledge regarding ITNs and malaria related information. However, inhabitants had poor attitude and practice towards the ITNs utilization due to lack of availability and affordability. Therefore, besides health education campaign, distribution and promotion of ITNs to entire rural residents at free of charge may possibly bring constructive outcome in the near future.

N2  - Objective: To examine the frequency and profile of spontaneous reports of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) sent to Ethiopia's pharmacovigilance (PV) database system. Methods: The descriptive and retrospective study analysed spontaneous ADR complaints reported to the PV database by healthcare professionals between 2013 and 2018. Spontaneous ADR reports that reached the PV center and met the minimum reporting criteria were identified and assessed in terms of reporting rate, patient characteristics, type of ADRs, suspected drugs, report sources, and reporters profession. Results: A total of 657 spontaneous ADR reports were filed to the PV center between 2013 and 2018. During the study period, the reporting pattern of ADRs changed dramatically. The number of reports increased from 2013 (n=12) and peaked in 2015 (n=205), and then declined from 2016 to 2018 (n=144, 142 and 65 in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively). Females had a higher percentage of reported cases (56.3%) than males (43.7%). The highest number of ADRs was reported in the age categories of 15-64 years (475, 72.3%), followed by 0-14 years (154, 23.4%), and 65 years and above (21, 3.2%). Pharmacists reported the majority of ADRs (81.7%), followed by health officers (7.2%), nurses (5.8%), and physicians (5.2%). Skin and subcutaneous tissue abnormalities were the most commonly reported ADRs. The anatomical therapeutic chemicals code class "anti-infective for systemic use"was the most usually suspected medication. Trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole as a combination ADRs was the most commonly reported drug that cause ADRs (14.2%). Conclusions: The number of ADRs reported in Ethiopia was small and unpredictable compared to developed countries, indicating the performance of PV system and level of awareness of health care professionals towards ADR reporting was not satisfactory. In order to increase the frequency of spontaneous reports, more efficient PV methods and public policies must be implemented. © 2022 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine Produced by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.

N2  - This study aimed to determine residues of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in tomato and onion samples collected from selected markets in the Jimma zone. A QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) method was used for sample preparation followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for OCPs analysis. The method used showed wide linear ranges from 5-50 μg/L for all eight pesticides, with R2 values ≥ 0.992. The LOD values for the pesticides tested ranged from 0.14 μg/kg for p,p'-DDE to 2.40 μg/kg for p,p-DDT. LOQ values ranged from 0.46 μg/kg for p,p-DDE to 8.32 μg/kg for p,p'-DDT. The recoveries ranged from 74.84 – 109.45 % except for β-BHC (67.82 %). While most of the OCPs in the onion and tomato samples met European Union (EU) and Codex standards, some exceeded the limits. Methoxychlor and p,p'-DDT in onions, and methoxychlor, p,p'-DDT, α-BHC, and δ-BHC in some tomatoes, were detected above the permitted levels. Specific OCPs were not detected in some samples including aldrin in Meki Tomato (Mek-T), γ-chlordane in Agaro Tomato (Ag-T), and p,p'-DDE in Gera Tomato (Ger-T). The residual concentrations of OCPs varied among the samples. Among tomatoes, Gera had the highest percentage of detected OCPs contaminants (37 %), followed by Agaro (34.34 %) and Meki (28.55 %). Similarly, Sire onion (SrO) had the highest percentage of detected OCPs (28 %) compared to Minjer (25.16 %), Shewa Robit (25.10 %), and Sudan onion (22.25 %). In conclusion, most tomato and onion samples analyzed in this study contained OCP residues highlighting the importance of conducting a consumer health risk assessment. © 2024 The Authors

N2  - In this study, analysis of some selected organophosphorus and organochlorine pesticides was carried out in tomato samples collected from the markets of Mettu town, Ilu Aba Bora Zone, Oromia, Ethiopia. The quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) method was used for the extraction of collected samples using acetonitrile with 1% acetic acid, anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and anhydrous sodium acetate, followed by dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-SPE). Chromatographic separation and quantitative determination of the pesticides were performed by gas chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometer. The calibration curves for each analyte constructed in tomato samples were linear in the concentration range of 2–200 μg/kg with R2 > 0.99 and the LODs and LOQs of the method were in the range of 0.01–0.04 μg/kg and 0.04–0.13 μg/kg, respectively. The recovery and precision study results were within acceptable standard guidelines. Of the fourteen pesticides tested, chlordane, hexachlorobenzene, 4, 4'-DDE, 4, 4'-DDD, 4, 4'- DDT, and profenofos were detected at 0.15, 0.09, 0.17, 0.032, 1.24 and 0.062 μg/kg, respectively. Despite the concentrations of the detected pesticides being lower than the maximum residue limit recommended by FAO/WHO, the presence of these toxic chemicals in tomatoes indicates product contamination and requires extensive further investigation with the inclusion of other pesticides. © 2023 The Authors

N2  - Maize FAWs, S. frugiperda, are economically important pests of maize plants in the field and cause considerable damage of up to 50% in Ethiopia. A total of six insecticides (Malathion 50 EC, Diazinon 48% EC, Alpha-cypermethrin, Deltamethrin, Lambda-cyhalothrin and Dimethoate 40% EC) were tested at laboratory, plot trails (using irrigation System) and farmers maize field (using 3 Delta-type traps) during 2019 to 2020 cropping season. Our result showed that, significant mortality of S. frugiperda was observed in the laboratory bioassay. Alpha-Cypermethrin and Deltamethrin at 24HAT and 72HAT account 76.67% and 100% and 96.67 and 100% of mortality. Highest number of larval mortalities was recorded on the treatment plot treated with Alpha-Cypermethrin (40%) at day one after insecticide application. Dimethoate and Alpha-cypermethrin (5%), Deltamethrin (3.67%) and Lambda-cyhalothrin (7.33%) significantly reduced FAWs infestation at farmers maize farm compared to that of non-treated control group/and plot (27%) at day one after insecticide application respectively. Therefore, the current finding proves that the pyrethroid class of the selected insecticides reduced the damage and infestation level of S. frugiperda in the maize field conditions. Based on the number of maize fall armyworm (the moth group) captured per pheromone traps, the percent of damaged plant and whorl infestations were significantly lowered, and the tools were appropriate to develop IPM programs in Ethiopia. © 2022 The Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Although much progress has been made in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality worldwide in the last decade, nationally malaria remains the third leading cause of death and still considered a major public health problem. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess malaria as a public health problem in and around the sugar cane plantation area of Arjo Didhessa sugar factory, Western Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study supplemented with clinical retrospective data, which included 452 study subjects was recruited and the study period was extended from May 2016 up to November of 2017. A standardized questionnaire was used to assess malaria risk factors and blood samples were received from all study participants and further subjected to Giemsa staining for determination of malaria prevalence. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 20. Malaria risk factors were identified by multivariate logistic regression at a significance level of P < 0.05. RESULTS: The overall malaria prevalence was 3.1%; Plasmodium vivax is the main type of malaria parasite. Overnight outdoor sleeping and improper utilization of mosquito bed nets were found to be statistically significant as malaria risk factors in the community. In the retrospective studies of five years, the peak malaria cases (13.84%) were reported in 2013 and the lowest cases (1.24%) in 2017. CONCLUSIONS: The figure for malaria witnessed in this area remains higher than the observed national malaria prevalence indicating malaria remains a public health problem. Therefore, we suggest the factory administrators and health care professionals work more on raising awareness to avoid night outdoor sleeping and promote frequent and appropriate utilization of insecticide-treated nets in line with regular indoor residual spraying.

N2  - Food legumes are key commodities produced in sole and mixed cropping system in Ethiopia. Their productivity has been affected recently by virus infections. Field surveys were conducted from 2018/19 to 2021/22 cropping seasons in the highlands of Ethiopia to identify major viruses and determine how biophysical factors affect disease incidence. A total of 2797 samples of chickpea (755), lentil (1683), fenugreek (111) and grass pea (248) were collected from 194 farmers' fields in Amhara (North Shewa, South Wollo and East Gojjam zones) and Oromia (East Shewa, West Shewa and North Shewa zones) regions. Laboratory testing using Tissue blot immunoassay showed that chickpea chlorotic stunt virus (CpCSV, genus Polerovirus, family Solemoviridae) and pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV, genus Potyvirus, family Potyviridae) were the major viruses affecting legume crops in Ethiopia. The highest relative virus incidence of CpCSV (90.6%) and PSbMV (11.5%) was recorded in samples of chickpea and lentil crops, respectively. Except for crop conditions, all the independent variables significantly affected PSbMV incidence, whereas all independent variables showed a highly significant association (p <.0001) with CpCSV Incidence. A CpCSV incidence of ≥30% had a high probability of association with chickpea and fenugreek crops, the presence of aphid vectors and the 2018/19 cropping season. Similarly, PSbMV with an incidence ≥7% was highly associated with the 2018/19 cropping season. Both viruses can be managed by the combined application of cultural practices, insecticide's application, healthy seeds and resistance breeding. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

N2  - Malaria is the leading public health problem in Ethiopia where over 75% of the land surface is at risk with varying intensities depending on altitude and season. Although the mortality because of malaria infection has declined much during the last 15-20 years, some researchers worry that this success story may not be sustainable. Past notable achievements in the reduction of malaria disease burden could be reversed in the future. To interrupt, or even to eliminate malaria transmission in Ethiopia, there is a need to implement a wide range of interventions that include insecticide-treated bed nets, indoor residual spraying, improved control of residual malaria transmission, and improved diagnostics, enhanced surveillance, and methods to deal with the emergence of resistance both to drugs and to insecticides. Developments during the past years with increasing awareness about the role of very low levels of malaria prevalence can sustain infections, may also demand that tools not used in the routine control efforts to reduce or eliminate malaria, should now be made available in places where malaria transmission occurs.

N2  - Integrated management of faba bean chocolate spot (Botrytis fabae Sard.) was studied using moderately tolerant variety, “Hachalu” and the local cultivar at Chilga district during 2016 main cropping season. The objective was to evaluate effect of host resistance, intercropping and fungicide applications on epidemics of faba bean chocolate spot, yield and yield components of faba bean, and sole and intercrop systems productivity. The experiment was randomised complete block design in a factorial combination of two faba bean cultivars, two cropping systems (Hachalu- and local-barley intercropping in 2:1 ratio) and four levels of fungicide (Chlorothalonil) spray and integration in three replications of faba bean and barley, respectively. Cultivars and spray intervals significantly (p <.01) affected the seed yield while cultivars alone had significant variation (p <.01) on 100-seed weight as a main effect. Therefore, 21-days fungicide spray intervals integrated with Hachalu sole and Hachalu-barley intercropping may be considered for chocolate spot management. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Generating evidence on the dry season occurrence of the larval and adult stages of Anopheles mosquitoes helps to design effective malaria vector control strategy as the populations of the vectors is expected to be low. METHODS: Larval and adult stages of Anopheles were surveyed during dry seasons in Mender Meter, Jiga Yehlmidar and Wongie Berkegn villages, Jabi Tehnan District, West Gojjam Zone, Ethiopia. Larvae were surveyed (along the available surface water collections), sampled, identified into genus, counted and late instars of the genus Anopheles identified into species. Indoor-resting adult mosquitoes were collected using insecticide aerosol spray, processed and identified into species. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20.0 to determine frequencies, mean differences and associations. RESULTS: A total of 3127 Anopheles larvae were collected among which most (91.7%; 2869/3127) were from streams followed by ponds (4.3%; 136/3127) and swamps (3.9%; 122/3127). Anopheles gambiae sensu lato was the most prevalent (84.9%; 921/1085) followed by Anopheles cinereus (7.0%; 76/1085), Anopheles chrysti (3.7%; 40/1085), Anopheles demeilloni (2.8%; 30/1085) and Anopheles rhodesiensis (1.6%; 18/1085). The mean number (mean = 15.3) of An. gambiae from Jiga Yehlmidar was significantly (p = 0.024) higher than the corresponding number (mean = 3.2) from Mender Meter. The mean number (mean = 36.3) of An. gambiae larvae in April 2017 was significantly (p = 0.001) higher than the number (mean = 4.0) in December 2013 and the number (mean = 2.6) in March 2013. A total of 1324 adult Anopheles were collected of which the highest proportion (79.1%; 1048/1324) was An. gambiae, followed by An. chrysti (11.7%; 155/1324), An. demeilloni (6%; 80/1324), An. cinereus (2.6%; 35/1324) and Anopheles coustani (0.5%; 6/1324). The highest proportion (54.3%; 569/1048) of the An. gambiae was collected from Wongie Berkegn followed by Jiga Yehlmidar (23.6%; 247/1048) and Mender Meter (22.1%; 232/1048). The mean number (mean = 7.8) of adult An. gambiae caught in Wongie Berkegn was significantly (p = 0.018) higher compared to the number (mean = 3.0) in Mender Meter. No significant difference was observed in the mean number of adult An. gambiae between the seasons. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: Streams were prolific breeding habitats of Anopheles mosquitoes followed by ponds and swamps in the dry seasons. In addition, a high population of indoor resting An. gambiae was caught from indoors. This implies the need for a strengthened vector control during dry seasons using breeding habitat management and improved housing in addition to the existing insecticide (LLINs and IRS) based interventions in Jabi Tehnan District, West Gojjam Zone, Ethiopia.

N2  - The study was conducted to assess the species composition, population size, public knowledge, and threats to Galliform birds in the Arjo-Didessa River Valley, Southwestern Ethiopia. Data were collected from January 2018 to December 2020, covering both the dry and wet seasons. The study area was classified into four habitat categories: farmland, forest, grassland, and riverine areas. A line transects survey and point count routes were employed in the open habitats and dense habitats, respectively, to collect data. The species’ composition and relative abundance of Galliformes were estimated by timed species counting and encounter rates. To assess public knowledge and threats, direct inventories, questionnaire surveys, key informant interviews, and informal communications were employed. Three Galliform species, namely, Clapperton’s Francolin (Pternistis clappertoni), Helmeted Guineafowl (Numida meleagris), and Stone Partridge (Ptilopachus petrosus), were recorded in the area. The Helmeted Guineafowl were abundant (66.83%), Clapperton’s Francolin was common (30.14%), and Stone Partridge was a rare (3.03%) species. The population size of Galliformes recorded in the area was 461 during the dry season and 365 during the wet season, with a mean population size of 124.5 ± 11.5, 276 ± 33, and 12.5 ± 3.50 individuals of Clapperton’s Francolin, Helmeted Guineafowl, and Stone Partridge, respectively. The recorded flock size of Galliformes ranged from 1 to 22 individuals per flock. There was a statistically significant difference (F = 90.06, df = 3, and p < 0.05 ) in the population size of Galliformes between habitats, where the highest mean was recorded in the farmland (141.5 ± 7.5) and the lowest in the riverine (61.5 ± 43.5) habitats. The majority of the respondents (86.36%, n = 286) have prior knowledge and awareness about guineafowl and francolin species. They use these species mainly as a source of food (55.06%), eggs and meat consumption, a source of income (28.48%), and other values (16.45%), including foster-rearing and medical practices. In addition, guarding, trapping, scarecrows, and related crop raid protection measures were employed in the area to protect crops from crop damage by these birds. Although there is factual public understanding and a positive attitude towards Galliformes in the study area, habitat destruction and loss, agricultural intensification, overgrazing, fire, fuelwood collection, agrochemicals, and hunting and egg collection were observed as major threats affecting the species and their habitats. Further research and community-based conservation interventions are, therefore, essential to thoroughly monitor the population trends of Galliformes and maintain their habitats in the region.

N2  - Emergence and spread of malaria vectors resistant to the available insecticides required a new and efficacious insecticide. Residual efficacy of Fludora® Fusion was evaluated against insecticide susceptible Anopheles arabiensis in ten circular huts similar to the residential huts. Fludora® Fusion WP-SB 56.25, FICAM WP80 and Clothianidin WG70 were sprayed, by experienced technician, on interior wall surfaces: paint, dung, smooth mud, and rough mud. WHO cone bioassays were carried out a month after spraying and thereafter on monthly intervals for 12 months. Knockdown was recorded at 60 minutes and mortality at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours holding time post-exposure. Fludora Fusion induced 100% An. arabiensis mortality during the first four months post-treated on all surface types at 24 hours holding time post-exposure. Its activity remained over 80% from the fifth to the twelfth month post-treated on the surfaces with the exception of two assessment points, at seventh month and eleventh month, on paint and smooth mud surfaces. FICAM induced 100% mortality rate during the first 4 months and 92% mortality during the fifth month post-treatment on painted surfaces. Its activity was over 96% mortality 1-month post-treatment on smooth mud and rough mud surfaces and 92% mortality 2-month post-treatment on dung surfaces. Clothianidin caused 89% and 86% mortality 1-month post-treatment on smooth mud and rough mud surfaces. Fludora Fusion can be used as alternative indoor residual insecticide spraying against An. arabiensis in Ethiopia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Despite remarkable progress in malaria burden reduction, malaria continues to be a major public health problem globally. Ethiopia has been distributing long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for free and nationwide distribution was completed in 2016. However, evidence suggests that the utilization of LLINs varies from setting to setting and from time to time due to different factors, and up-to-date evidence is required for LLIN related decision-making. Hence, this study was designed to assess LLIN utilization and its determinants in the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (SNNPR) of Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Ethiopia in 2019. Using multi-stage sampling, a total of 2466 households were included. The region was stratified based on the annual malaria index as high, moderate, low, and free strata. Cluster sampling was then applied to select households from high, moderate, and low strata. Data on LLIN ownership, utilization and different determinant factors were collected using household questionnaire. SurveyCTO was used to collect data and data was managed using Stata 15. Descriptive statistics and multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression were performed to identify the determinants of utilization of LLINs. Effect measures were reported using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% CI. RESULTS: From a total of 2466 households, 48.7% of households had at least one LLIN. LLIN adequacy based on family size was 23% while it was15.7% based on universal access and 29.2% based on sleeping space. From 1202 households that possessed LLIN(s), 66.0% of households reported that they slept under LLIN the night preceding the survey. However, when the total population in all surveyed households were considered, only 22.9% of household members slept under LLIN the night preceding the survey. Malaria endemicity, educational status, wealth status, and knowledge about malaria were associated with LLINs utilization. In addition, reasons for non-use included perceived absence of malaria, side effects of LLIN, conditions of LLINs, inconvenient space and low awareness. CONCLUSION: Low LLIN coverage and low utilization were noted. A low level of utilization was associated with malaria endemicity, wealth status and level of awareness. Distribution of LLIN and continuous follow-up with community awareness creation activities are vital to improve coverage and utilization of LLINs, and to ensure the country's malaria elimination goal.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ethiopia is among sub-Saharan African countries with a high number of malaria cases each year, with most of the landmass favoring the breeding of the vectors. There have been extensive efforts to control and prevent the transmission of malaria, which is part of the country's prevention-based health policy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine malaria prevalence and associated risk factors among patients visiting Mizan-Tepi University Teaching Hospital (MTUTH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September to December 2021 among patients visiting MTUTH, Southwest Ethiopia. A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect sociodemographic data, and a capillary blood sample was collected after obtaining written informed consent from the study participants. The data were entered into Epi-data manager (v4.0.2.101) and analyzed with SPSS version 25.0, with a P-value of < 0.05 set as a significance. RESULTS: A total of 439 patients participated, of which 20.7% (91) were positive for malaria parasites, with a higher prevalence observed among the age group interval of 25-34 years (5.5%). Inadequate access to insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) 23.9% (105) and a low level of ITN usage 20.5% (90) were recorded. Patients living in areas of stagnant water were more likely to get infected with the malaria parasite (AOR = 16.191, 95% CI: 9.137, 28.692) compared to those who live away from stagnant water, and individuals living in houses not sprayed with insecticides were more susceptible to malaria infection (AOR = 0.215, 95% CI: 0.128, 0.360). CONCLUSION: The overall malaria prevalence in this study was 20.7% (91), which proves that malaria remains a major threat to the communities in the study area, with Plasmodium falciparum contributing to most of the cases. Improving the habits of ITN usage and indoor residual spray through health education may help to reduce the impact of malaria in the study area.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anopheles arabiensis, member species of the Anopheles gambiae complex, is the primary vector of malaria and is widely distributed in Ethiopia. Anopheles funestus, Anopheles pharoensis and Anopheles nili are secondary vectors occurring with limited distribution in the country. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are pillars for the interventions against malaria control and elimination efforts in Ethiopia. However, the emergence and widespread of insecticide resistance in An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.), might compromise the control efforts of the country. The aim of this study was to investigate composition of mosquito fauna and insecticide resistance status of An. gambiae s.l. in Itang special district ( woreda), Gambella, southwestern Ethiopia. METHODS: Adult mosquitoes were sampled from September 2020 to February 2021 using the CDC light trap and pyrethrum spray catch (PSC). CDC light traps were placed in three selected houses for two consecutive days per month to collect mosquitoes indoor and outdoor from 6:00 P.M. to 06:00 A.M. and PSC was used to collect indoor resting mosquitoes from ten selected houses once in a month from October 2020 to February 2021. Moreover, mosquito larvae were also collected from different breeding sites and reared to adults to assess susceptibility status of populations of An. gambiae s.l. in the study area. Susceptibility tests were conducted on two to three days old non blood fed female An. gambiae s.l. using insecticide impregnated papers with deltamethrin (0.05%), alpha-cypermethrin (0.05%), propoxur (0.1%), pirimiphos-methyl (0.25%) and bendiocarb (0.1%) following World Health Organization (WHO) standard susceptibility test procedure. Molecular diagnostics were done for the identification of member species of An. gambiae s.l. and detection of knockdown resistance (kdr) allele using species specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and allele specific PCR. RESULTS: In total, 468 adult mosquitoes were collected from different houses. Culex mosquitoes were the most dominant (80.4%) followed by Anopheles mosquitoes. Three species of Anopheles (Anopheles coustani, An. pharoensis, and An. gambiae s.l.) were identified, of which An. coustani was the dominant (8.1%) species. Higher number of mosquitoes (231) were collected outdoor by CDC light traps. Out of 468 adult mosquitoes, 294 were blood fed, 46 were half-gravid and gravid whereas the remaining 128 were unfed. WHO bioassay tests revealed that the populations of An. gambiae s.l. in the study area are resistant against alpha-cypermethrin and deltamethrin, but susceptible to bendiocarb, pirimiphos-methyl and propoxur. Of the total 86 An. gambiae s.l. specimens assayed, 79 (92%) successfully amplified and identified as An. arabiensis. West African kdr (L1014F) mutation was detected with high kdr allele frequency ranging from 67 to 88%. CONCLUSION: The detection of target site mutation, kdr L1014F allele, coupled with the phenotypic resistance against alpha-cypermethrin and deltamethrin call for continuous resistance monitoring.

N2  - The responses of thrips to commonly used insecticides were studied in onion fields with the aim of detecting presence or absence of thrips resistance to insecticides in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Thrips populations were collected from area with heavy pesticide use history Meki and Melkassa and less use areas of Werer and Minjar. Collected adult thrips populations were exposed to various concentrations of λ -cyhalothrin, dimethoate, profenofos, diazinon and spinetoram treated vial and thrips mortality was assessed after 24 h. The percent mortality was significantly lower in Meki and Melkassa collected thrips populations than in Minjar and Werer populations to λ –cyhalothrin and diazinon at recommended field rate. On the other hand, differences were insignificant for the insecticides spinetoram and profenofos at recommended field rate. Of the five tested insecticides λ –cyhalothrin had higher resistance ratios to Meki (10.8-fold) and Melkassa (6.78- fold) collected thrips population, while resistance ratio was intermediate to diazinon and lowest to dimethoate and profenofos insecticides. Results of this study suggest that thrips affecting onion in Meki and Melkassa areas have developed resistance to λ –cyhalothrin and diazinon insecticides. Periodic assessment of efficacy of registered insecticides and deploying a pesticides resistance management strategy are useful for sustainable use of pesticides in integrated thrips management program. © 2020, African Association of Insect Scientists.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anemia during pregnancy is a well known medical condition most of the time under-recognized as it is overshadowed by the normal physiological condition during pregnancy. This study aimed at determining the prevalence and predictors of anemia among pregnant women residing in the rural surroundings of Arbaminch Town, south Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional community based study was conducted between April and June, 2013. A structured questionnaire was used to collect socio-economic and socio-demographic characteristics of the pregnant women. Hematocrit (HCT) level was determined to classify the pregnant women as anemic and non-anemic. Diagnosis of asymptomatic malaria parasitemia was done by Giemsa stained blood smear microscopy. HCT < 33%, (HCT ≥ 30% & < 33%), (HCT ≥ 21% & < 30%), and HCT < 21% was used to indicate anemia, mild anemia, moderate anemia, and severe anemia respectively. RESULTS: A total of 341 pregnant women participated in this study, out of which 118 (34.6%) were anemic. The median age of the pregnant women was 25 years (Inter-quartile range: 23-29). The mean HCT was 35.2% (95% CI: 34.6%-35.8%) with SD of ±5.5%. Of those 118 anemic women; 73(61.9%) were mildly anemic, 38(32.2%) were moderately anemic, and 7(5.9%) were found to be severely anemic. The prevalence of asymptomatic malaria parasitemia was 9.1% (31/341). The odds of being anemic were 15.72 times [AOR: 15.72, 95% CI (3.97, 62.22), P-value ≤ 0.001] more likely to occur in parasitemic individuals relative to the non parasitemic pregnant women. Not using insecticide treated bed net (ITN) was a significant predictor of anemia among the pregnant women [AOR: 3, 95% CI: (1.72, 5.22), P < 0.001]. CONCLUSION: This study highlighted the significant association between anemia and asymptomatic malaria among pregnant women in the study area. Therefore, the practice of routine screening for malaria and anemia followed by prompt management should be encouraged to curb the effect of malaria and anemia on the pregnant women as well as her fetus. Further studies should also be in place to test the effectiveness of routine screening for malaria and anemia followed by prompt management.

N2  - Background: Acute poisoning with agrochemicals, medicines and different environmental exposures continues to be a global health problems. However, with our search for reports about acute poisoning, there was no data regarding a change in trends and outcomes of acute poisoning in Ethiopia and its districts. Objective: This study was to determine the burden of poison-related health hazards, identify poisoning substances, and clinical outcomes of poisoning cases admitted to Felege Hiwot Comprehensive Specialized Hospital-Medical intensive care unit (FHCSH-MICU), Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. Methods: A retrospective hospital-based study was conducted using patient data archived from March 2019 to February 2020 at FHCSH-MICU. Collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 26 and descriptive statistics such as measures of central tendency and proportions were computed. The results were reported as text narrations, figures and tables. Results: A total 121 poisoned patients were identified from the patient registration log books. Among the total FHCSH-MICU cases registered, acute poisoning accounted for 17.0%. Of 121 poison cases, 118 (98.3%) were due to suicide attempts with the female to male ratio being 1.5:1. The majority, 65 (54.0%), of cases were in the range of 21–30 years age. Nearly two-thirds, 75 (62.0%), of the poisoning cases died, accounting for 21.6% of all deaths in the FHCSH-MICU. The most common poisoning substance was aluminum phosphide, 92 (76%). Conclusion and Recommendations: Aluminum phosphide became the leading poisoning substance in the study area. Nearly two-thirds of the poisoning cases died. Hence, aluminum phosphide must be placed in secured and inaccessible places and it should be replaced by less poisonous rodenticides. Health education and awareness creation about this lethal toxin are strongly advisable. © 2022 Shumet et al. This work is published.

N2  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), popularly known as kala-azar, is essentially a disease of poverty. Kala-azar is caused by a parasite, Leishmania donovani. Recent review indicates that worldwide 98 countries are endemic for kala-azar. Approximately 0.2-0.4 million new VL cases occur each year worldwide. More than 90% of global VL cases occur in Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, South Sudan, and Sudan. This trend is slowly changing due to the progress in kala-azar elimination in southeast Asia, where Bangladesh has reported an average of some 600 new cases in 2014-2015. With the advancement in our knowledge about the disease and development of tools to diagnose and treat VL, it was considered that elimination of kala-azar was possible from India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. The three countries signed a memorandum of understanding in 2005 for collaboration. Miltefosine is the first ever oral drug developed to treat VL, which was later replaced by lipid amphotericin B. The main components of the strategy are early diagnosis using rK39 strip test and complete treatment utilizing miltefosine for 28 days. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane or pyrethroids were deployed for vector control. There was much to be desired for better performance of the vector control activity. Pharmacovigilance and monitoring of drug resistance were the weakest part of the program. In the post-elimination phase, surveillance reinforced by active case finding will of a crucial factor for sustainability of the elimination. A strong political will is required to ensure elimination of kala-azar from the Indian subcontinent and its sustainability in the post-elimination phase. © 2017 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Malaria elimination programs have also encountered numerous challenges, such as widespread asymptomatic carriers in endemic areas, which should be taken into account in malaria-control programs for effective transmission interruption. The purpose of this research was to determine the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infections and associated factors, in pastoral communities. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among selected districts in the Waghemra Zone, Northeast Ethiopia, from September to December 2022. A structured questionnaire was employed to collect sociodemographic data and associated risk factors. Plasmodium species were detected using light microscopy and a rapid diagnostic test. Data entry and analysis were carried out using SPSS version 26 software. The association between dependent and independent variables was explored by using multivariable logistic regression analyses. A statistically significant association was declared at a p-value of <0.05. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of malaria was 21.2% (134/633), with the predominant Plasmodium falciparum infections accounting for 67.8% (87/134). Among asymptomatic participants, 7.5% (34/451) and 10.2% (46/451) were diagnosed by rapid diagnostic test and light microscopy, respectively. On the other hand, the prevalence of symptomatic malaria was 44.5% (81/182) and 48.4% (88/182) as diagnosed by rapid diagnostic test and light microscopy, respectively. The presence of stagnant water near the houses, the utilization of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, the number of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and outdoor stays at night were all positively linked with the prevalence of malaria. CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence estimate for symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria was high. Malaria is still a public health problem in the study area. Malaria infection was associated with the presence of stagnant water near the houses, the utilization of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, the number of insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and outdoor stays at night. Improved access to all malaria interventions is needed to interrupt the transmission at the community level.

N2  - The existence of pockets of under-vaccinated persons has allowed outbreaks of disease incountries that have achieved high levels of vaccination coverage. A field-based methodology GAPS (Geographic Assessment of Planning and Services)-was developed to predict, in advance of an immunization campaign, the sites of which are most likely to have a pocket of unvaccinated persons and then use this information to improve planning, supervision, and evaluation of the campaign. At this time, there have been two applications of GAPS (Nepal and Ethiopia). The purpose of this paper was to evaluate these two applications of GAPS and make recommendations regarding its future use. Structured, expert interviews were conducted with at least three campaign organizers to evaluate each application of GAPS using purposive sampling. An evaluation of an individual campaign was considered positive when at least two of the three campaign organizers considered GAPS to be useful and worthwhile. The three campaign organizers interviewed following the GAPS application in Ethiopia responded that GAPS was useful and worth the effort. In Nepal, all four campaign organizers responded that GAPS was useful and worth the effort. Some suggestions for improvement were also identified. Although this evaluation was limited in the number of applications evaluated, GAPS appears to have promise as a practical method to help improve the quality of mass immunization campaigns. And even if no pockets of unvaccinated persons are found, the method may serve as a rapid quality-check of administrative estimates of coverage. Further applications in different settings are needed to confirm these findings or under what circumstances GAPS might best be used. GAPS may also be considered for improving other types of health campaigns, such as distribution of insecticide-treated bednets, vitamin A capsules, and deworming medications. © International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.

N2  - Ascochyta blight disease is a major problem in faba bean (Vicia faba L) production that causes 90% to 100% yield loss. A field experiment was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of three fungicides with three spray frequency levels against Ascochyta blight disease of faba bean varieties. For the assessment of disease management, a total of 21 treatments were used, which comprised three fungicides, three spray frequencies, two varieties, and control. The field experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with factorial combinations of variety, fungicide, and spray frequency levels in three replications. An analysis of variance was performed for disease, yield, and yield related and plant growth parameter data, using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS, 2003) version 9.1.3 software. The economic data obtained from the field experiment was analyzed using the partial budget analysis method. The results showed that area under disease progress curve, percent severity index, disease progress rate, and percent disease incidence had strong mean significant differences (p<0.01) between treated and untreated plots. Application of fungicide significantly increased plant height, stem girth, pod per plant, grain yield, and harvesting index (p<0.01) over untreated plots. Greater total return (195,938 Ethiopian birr ha-1), net return (101,761.3 Ethiopian birr ha-1), and net benefit (34,768.17 Ethiopian birr ha-1) were obtained by EH00102-4-1 variety, in two times Mancolaxyl treatment. The linear regression analysis result (R2) indicated that the variation in average grain yield of EH00102-4-1 and local susceptible varieties, due to the mean area under the disease progress curve, was 64.50% and 68.64%, respectively. Therefore, the use of EH00102-4-1 variety, with two times Mancolaxyl spray frequency application, at early growth stage and the onset of the disease is suggested as an agronomic management option, in Northwestern Ethiopia. © 2023 Habtu Tessema et al.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In 2005, a nationwide survey estimated that 6.5% of households in Ethiopia owned an insecticide-treated net (ITN), 17% of households had been sprayed with insecticide, and 4% of children under five years of age with a fever were taking an anti-malarial drug. Similar to other sub-Saharan African countries scaling-up malaria interventions, the Government of Ethiopia set an ambitious national goal in 2005 to (i) provide 100% ITN coverage in malarious areas, with a mean of two ITNs per household; (ii) to scale-up indoor residual spraying of households with insecticide (IRS) to cover 30% of households targeted for IRS; and (iii) scale-up the provision of case management with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), particularly at the peripheral level. METHODS: A nationally representative malaria indicator survey (MIS) was conducted in Ethiopia between September and December 2007 to determine parasite and anaemia prevalence in the population at risk and to assess coverage, use and access to scaled-up malaria prevention and control interventions. The survey used a two-stage random cluster sample of 7,621 households in 319 census enumeration areas. A total of 32,380 people participated in the survey. Data was collected using standardized Roll Back Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group MIS household and women's questionnaires, which were adapted to the local context. RESULTS: Data presented is for households in malarious areas, which according to the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health are defined as being located <2,000 m altitude. Of 5,083 surveyed households, 3,282 (65.6%) owned at least one ITN. In ITN-owning households, 53.2% of all persons had slept under an ITN the prior night, including 1,564/2,496 (60.1%) children <5 years of age, 1,891/3,009 (60.9%) of women 15 - 49 years of age, and 166/266 (65.7%) of pregnant women. Overall, 906 (20.0%) households reported to have had IRS in the past 12 months. Of 747 children with reported fever in the two weeks preceding the survey, 131 (16.3%) sought medical attention within 24 hours. Of those with fever, 86 (11.9%) took an anti-malarial drug and 41 (4.7%) took it within 24 hours of fever onset. Among 7,167 surveyed individuals of all ages, parasitaemia as estimated by microscopy was 1.0% (95% CI 0.5 - 1.5), with 0.7% and 0.3% due to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, respectively. Moderate-severe anaemia (haemoglobin <8 g/dl) was observed in 239/3,366 (6.6%, 95% CI 4.9-8.3) children <5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Since mid-2005, the Ethiopian National Malaria Control Programme has considerably scaled-up its malaria prevention and control interventions, demonstrating the impact of strong political will and a committed partnership. The MIS showed, however, that besides sustaining and expanding malaria intervention coverage, efforts will have to be made to increase intervention access and use. With ongoing efforts to sustain and expand malaria intervention coverage, to increase intervention access and use, and with strong involvement of the community, Ethiopia expects to achieve its targets in terms of coverage and uptake of interventions in the coming years and move towards eliminating malaria.

N2  - Parasitoids are the most important bio-control agents in suppressing C. partellus populations. The exotic larval parasitoid, Cotesia flavipes Cameron was introduced into East Africa as a classical bio-control programme of cereal stem borers’ mainly Chilo partellus. In Ethiopia this parasitoid has never been released but it was found established and has been reported attacking C. partellus on sorghum. The abundance and impacts of C. flavipes on the population reduction of C. partellus were studied at different phenological stages of sorghum in three districts of South Wollo zone, Ethiopia, during 2016/17 and 2017/18. Result showed that C. flavipes’ abundance revealed significant difference among sorghum growth stages and across the districts. C. flavipes recorded abundantly at maturity stages of sorghum. The highest number (0.48) was recorded from Bati with the relative abundance of 33.8%. Parasitism by C. flavipes varied across the locations and host growth stages. The highest (61.5%) parasitism percentage was recorded from Bati at maturity in both seasons. In all the study sites parasitized larvae and percent parasitism were positively correlated with the late growth stages and negatively correlated with vegetative stages at Bati and Chefa and was significant at 0.05 levels. In conclusion C. partellus was found attacking by C. flavipes at the late growth stages of sorghum in all districts. Thus it is possible to suggest that the use of this parasitoid can be regarded as a suitable alternative to synthetic insecticides for the management of C. partellus in the field. © 2023, African Association of Insect Scientists.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The malaria incidence data from a malaria prevention study from the Rift Valley, Central Ethiopia, were reanalysed. The objective was to investigate whether including an administrative structure within the society, which may have required consideration in the protocol or previous analysis, would provide divergent outcomes on the effect measures of the interventions. METHODS: A cluster-randomized controlled trial lasting 121 weeks with 176 clusters in four groups with 6071 households with 34,548 persons was done: interventions combining indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), IRS alone, ITNs alone and routine use. The primary outcome was malaria incidence. A multilevel negative binomial regression model was employed to examine the impact of the kebele (smallest administrative unit) and the proximity of homes to the primary mosquito breeding sites as potential residual confounders (levels). The study also assessed whether these factors influenced the effect measures of the interventions. RESULTS: The study's initial findings revealed 1183 malaria episodes among 1059 persons, with comparable effects observed across the four intervention groups. In the reanalysis, the results showed that both ITN + IRS (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.63, P < 0.001) and ITN alone (IRR 0.78, P = 0.011) were associated with a greater reduction in malaria cases compared to IRS (IRR 0.90; P = 0.28) or the control (reference) group. The combined usage of IRS with ITN yields better outcomes compared to the standalone use of ITN and surpasses the effectiveness of IRS in isolation. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that implementing a combination of IRS and ITN and also ITN alone decrease malaria incidence. Furthermore, there was an observed synergistic impact when ITN and IRS were used in combination. Considering relevant social structures as potential residual confounders is of paramount importance.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are key components in malaria prevention and control strategy. However, the development of resistance by mosquitoes to insecticides recommended for IRS and/or ITNs/LLINs would affect insecticide-based malaria vector control. We assessed the susceptibility levels of Anopheles arabiensis to insecticides used in malaria control, characterized basic mechanisms underlying resistance, and evaluated the role of public health use of insecticides in resistance selection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Susceptibility status of An. arabiensis was assessed using WHO bioassay tests to DDT, permethrin, deltamethrin, malathion and propoxur in Ethiopia from August to September 2009. Mosquito specimens were screened for knockdown resistance (kdr) and insensitive acetylcholinesterase (ace-1(R)) mutations using AS-PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. DDT residues level in soil from human dwellings and the surrounding environment were determined by Gas Chromatography with Electron Capture Detector. An. arabiensis was resistant to DDT, permethrin, deltamethrin and malathion, but susceptible to propoxur. The West African kdr allele was found in 280 specimens out of 284 with a frequency ranged from 95% to 100%. Ace-1(R) mutation was not detected in all specimens scored for the allele. Moreover, DDT residues were found in soil samples from human dwellings but not in the surrounding environment. CONCLUSION: The observed multiple-resistance coupled with the occurrence of high kdr frequency in populations of An. arabiensis could profoundly affect the malaria vector control programme in Ethiopia. This needs an urgent call for implementing rational resistance management strategies and integrated vector control intervention.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria continues a significant public health challenge in Ethiopia, with Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) proving effective in reducing transmission. Despite their effectiveness, consistent LLIN utilization is influenced by various factors. While previous research has quantitatively analyzed LLIN ownership and usage, there is a lack of in-depth examination of the behavioral, sociocultural, socioeconomic, and distribution-related factors affecting their sustained use. This study aimed to explore barriers to persistent LLIN use among communities in northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: The study area found in Northwest Ethiopia, specifically in East Belessa District, is located at 12° 14' 60.00" N latitude and 37° 44' 59.99" E longitude, with an altitude between 1,200 and 1,800 m above sea level. Thirty-nine community members from five focus group discussions, along with five key informants, were interviewed between February 1st and 30th, 2020, about their use of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs). An interpretive description approach was employed to explore local contexts and factors affecting LLIN utilization. Focus group participants were selected based on residency status, pregnancy, caretaking of under-five children, and experience with LLINs. Key informants included health extension workers and the woreda malaria officer. Data were organized and analyzed using Open Code Version 4.03 software, with coding and theme identification conducted accordingly. RESULTS: All 44 community members from the five focus group discussions and the five key informants participated fully in the study. The study categorized its findings into three main themes: knowledge of malaria and Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN) use, perception of malaria threat, and barriers to sustained LLIN utilization. It identified factors spanning individual, socio-cultural, institutional, and socio-economic realms that impede consistent LLIN usage. Key hindrances include cultural misinterpretations, discomfort from heat and bed bugs, diverse net shapes, insufficient sleeping spaces, lack of awareness, inadequate distribution, neglect of vulnerable groups, misuse of non-sleeping purposes, hesitancy to hang nets, and restricted accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that practical concerns, including inadequate access to LLINs, distribution issues, discomfort from net shape and warmth, and unintended uses for non-malaria purposes, impact LLIN utilization. Socio-cultural norms, housing conditions, and varied understanding of malaria also contribute to inconsistent LLIN use. Strategies like providing compatible nets and comprehensive education could improve the Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets program's effectiveness in the area.

N2  - Faba bean is a cool season food legume crop. However, productivity of the crop is constrained by faba bean gall (FBG), which is an emerging disease that threatens faba bean production in Ethiopia. Field experiments were conducted on farmers’ fields to develop integrated management options that combine host resistance and fungicides to reduce FBG disease and minimize yield losses, and to determine fungicide spraying schedules in Bassona Worana district of Ethiopia, during 2018 and 2019. The treatments included three faba bean (Degaga, Gora, and local) genotypes, two fungicides, and two spray schedules, which were factorial arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The results revealed that integration of faba bean genotypes, fungicides, and spray schedules significantly (P < 0.001) reduced FBG disease progression and increased grain yield though genotypes showed variable disease reactions in both years. Gora sprayed with Bayleton at 10 days interval recorded low FBG disease progression (0.0125 and 0.0121 units day–1), severity (21.7 and 10%) and AUDPC (1866.7 and 751.7%-days), and high grain yield (3.7 and 5.0 t ha–1) in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Unsprayed plots of each genotype obtained high disease and low yield parameters in both years. However, high marginal rate of return was obtained from genotypes sprayed with Bayleton at 15 days interval in 2018 and 2019. Therefore, application of Bayleton at a rate of 0.7 kg ha−1 three-to-four sprays’ frequency with moderately tolerant faba bean variety can be recommended to manage FBG development and optimize grain yield in the study area. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society of Crop Science (KSCS).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Insecticide-based interventions play an integral role in malaria vector control. However, the continued spread of insecticide resistance threatens to undermine progress made thus far and may ultimately lead to operational failure of current control measures. Clothianidin and chlorfenapyr both have unique modes of action and have expanded the number of insecticide classes available to vector control programmes. Prior to field use, it is imperative to establish their toxicity against local mosquito populations and evaluate potential cross-resistance with other chemicals used contemporarily or historically. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic doses of clothianidin and chlorfenapyr and their efficacies against Anopheles arabiensis, the predominant Ethiopian malaria vector species. METHODS: A range of doses of clothianidin and chlorfenapyr were tested, using modified WHO susceptibility tests and CDC bottle bioassays, respectively, against an Ethiopian susceptible laboratory strain and a wild population of An. arabiensis collected from Oromia Region, Ethiopia. Cross-resistance to other public health insecticides: carbamates (bendiocarb and propoxur), organophosphate (malathion) and pyrethroids (deltamethrin and permethrin), was assessed in the same mosquito populations using CDC bottle bioassays. RESULTS: Complete mosquito mortality was observed with the laboratory strain using the recommended diagnostic doses for clothianidin (2%/filter paper) and chlorfenapyr (100 µg/bottle). The field population was resistant to malathion (83% mortality), capable of surviving 2×, 5× and 10× the diagnostic dose of both deltamethrin and permethrin, but susceptible to bendiocarb and propoxur. The field population of An. arabiensis was significantly more susceptible to clothianidin, reaching 100% mortality by day 2 compared to the laboratory strain (100% mortality by day 3). In contrast, the wild population was less susceptible to chlorfenapyr, with the highest mortality of 99% at 72 h using 200 µg/bottle compared to the laboratory colony, which reached complete mortality at 50 µg/bottle by 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: The putative diagnostic doses of clothianidin and chlorfenapyr are appropriate for monitoring resistance in An. arabiensis from Ethiopia. The unique modes of action and an absence of cross-resistance render clothianidin and chlorfenapyr potential candidates for inclusion in the National Malaria Control Programme vector control efforts, particularly in areas with high pre-existing or emergent resistance to other insecticide classes.

N2  - Pesticides aim to control pests and weeds and constitute an important input when producing a crop. A key source of information for pesticide use is the label on the pesticide container; however, there is little data on whether farmers in Southern Ethiopia’s Wolaita Zone actually use this information. To investigate small-scale farmers’ knowledge of pesticide labels, a survey was conducted in two districts of the Wolaita Zone. The majority of farmers (75.6%) stated that they had not bought pesticides in the original, informational packaging. 95.5% of farmers who bought pesticides with labels (24.4%) read the labels before using the product. One-fourth of the respondents (25.6%) said they typically trust development agents, whereas a significant portion of farmers (32.2%) said they mostly rely on information on pesticides from farmers who have experience. The survey found that, with an overall knowledge index of 0.29, the majority of farmers in the study area had low levels of awareness about the information contained on pesticide labels. The knowledge index values generally ranged from 0.16 to 0.62. Awareness creation training is vital for the farmers that used pesticides as one important input for their production besides the development agents should get intensive capacity development training to have a positive effect on farmers’ competence concerning pest management practices. © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - This study on Lake Abaya aimed to update information on its water quality in the wet and dry seasons. Water samples were collected from five lake sites on three dates in the dry and wet seasons. Two sites on the main inflowing river were sampled on two dates in each season. Analysis was carried out for selected nutrients total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), nitrate (NO3-N), total phosphate (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) as well as chlorophyll-a and silicate. Dissolved Oxygen (DO), % saturation, temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, and secchi readings were measured in situ. Lamparelli’s (2004) tropic state index (TSI) formula was used to assess trophic conditions. The key water quality issues identified are related to elevated concentrations of TSS, turbidity, and nutrients. TSS value (200 mg L− 1) and turbidity were high in wet. TAN levels were elevated in the lake (0.243 mg L− 1N) and the calculated unionized ammonia exceeded the no-effect limit. The SRP (0.927 mg L− 1P) and total phosphorus concentration were also elevated and significantly higher in the dry season. The lake is a hypertrophic system with the aforementioned sediment and nutrient levels exceeding thresholds for the protection of aquatic life. The lake is impacted by multiple co-occurring stressors. Land-use changes in the catchments and the use of various types of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to protect crops are exerting accelerated pressures on water quality in the lake and inflowing river. A suite of interventions both in terms of policy and practice, is urgently needed to halt its further degradation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Dengue Fever (DF) is a viral disease primarily transmitted by Aedes (Ae.) aegypti mosquitoes. Outbreaks in Eastern Ethiopia were reported during 2014-2016. In May 2017, we investigated the first suspected DF outbreak from Kabridahar Town, Somali region (Eastern Ethiopia) to describe its magnitude, assess risk factors, and implement control measures. METHODS: Suspected DF cases were defined as acute febrile illness plus ≥2 symptoms (headache, fever, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, or hemorrhage) in Kabridahar District residents. All reported cases were identified through medical record review and active searches. Severe dengue was defined as DF with severe organ impairment, severe hemorrhage, or severe plasma leakage. We conducted a neighborhood-matched case-control study using a subset of suspected cases and conveniently-selected asymptomatic community controls and interviewed participants to collect demographic and risk factor data. We tested sera by RT-PCR to detect dengue virus (DENV) and identify serotypes. Entomologists conducted mosquito surveys at community households to identify species and estimate larval density using the house index (HI), container index (CI) and Breteau index (BI), with BI≥20 indicating high density. RESULTS: We identified 101 total cases from May 12-31, 2017, including five with severe dengue (one death). The attack rate (AR) was 17/10,000. Of 21 tested samples, 15 (72%) were DENV serotype 2 (DENV 2). In the case-control study with 50 cases and 100 controls, a lack of formal education (AOR [Adjusted Odds Ratio] = 4.2, 95% CI [Confidence Interval] 1.6-11.2) and open water containers near the home (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-7.5) were risk factors, while long-lasting insecticide treated-net (LLITN) usage (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.05-0.79) was protective. HI and BI were 66/136 (49%) and 147 per 100 homes (147%) respectively, with 151/167 (90%) adult mosquitoes identified as Ae. aegypti. CONCLUSION: The epidemiologic, entomologic, and laboratory investigation confirmed a DF outbreak. Mosquito indices were far above safe thresholds, indicating inadequate vector control. We recommended improved vector surveillance and control programs, including best practices in preserving water and disposal of open containers to reduce Aedes mosquito density.

N2  - Introduction. Green mould, Penicillium digitatum (Pers.: Fr.) Sacc., causes economically important postharvest disease in citrus. Materials and methods. Ethiopian plant extracts of Acacia seyal (Del. Var. Seyal) and Withania somnifera (L.) Dual were used to test the control of green mould in wound-inoculated fruit, stored for 21 d at 7 °C and at > 85% RH. The chemical compositions of the two extracts were determined using high-performance chromatography. Thereafter, freshly harvested (naturally infected) fruit were subjected to different postharvest treatments and stored for 50 d to investigate the effects of the two plant extracts on fruit quality parameters. Treatments included (pre-wax + leaf extracts), (wax + leaf extracts incorporated into wax, Citrosol A(®)), (leaf extract alone), (fruit washed in chlorinated water at 5.25%), (untreated fruit) and (commercially treated fruit). Results. Extracts of A. seyal and W. somnifera reduced the incidence of green mould by 56.1% and 50%, respectively, in wound-inoculated fruit. A. seyal extract contained a high concentration of gallic acid (60.3 mg•mL(-1)) whilst W. somnifera contained low concentrations of caffeic acid (8.7 mg•mL(-1)), salicylic acid (6.3 mg•mL(-1)) and 3,4 dihydroxy benzoic acid (3.8 mg•mL(-1)). Green mould was absent in naturally infected fruit subjected to (pre-wax + leaf extracts), (wax mixed with leaf extracts) and (leaf extracts) treatments. (Pre-wax + leaf extracts) and (wax mixed with leaf extract) treatments significantly reduced weight loss; retained firmness and colour; and they maintained eating qualities and a maturity index (SSC/TA) similar to commercial treatment. Conclusion. Both extracts of A. seyal and W. somnifera showed potential to be used as an alternative in combined applications with wax application under low temperature storage to replace synthetic fungicides, to ultimately control green mould and retain overall fruit quality. © 2009 CIRAD EDP Sciences.

N2  - Finger millet is an important food crop that grows in arid and semi-arid parts of Africa and Asia and serve as a staple food source for millions of people. However, compared to other major crops, finger millet gives lower yield. For major crops high yield has been achieved through the introduction of improved varieties coupled with an intensive use of synthetic agrochemicals, often at the expense of the environment. In recent years endophytes received attention because of their potential to increase crop yield without massive application of synthetic chemicals. In this study seeds collected from three finger millet growing regions of Ethiopia contained a high load of bacterial endophytes. But no fungal endophytes were isolated from any of the samples. Based on their 16S rRNA gene sequence the isolates were identified as members of the genera Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Sphingobacterium, Microbacterium, and Curtobacterium. A significant number of the isolates produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), were able to grow on nitrogen free medium, solubilized phosphate, and produced hydrogen cyanide. The most interesting observation was that the different genera showed restricted occurrence to a specific geographic location. Differences in plant growth promotion capacity based on the geographic location from which the isolates were obtained was also observed. Therefore, location specific differences in the distribution of the different taxonomic groups and their difference in plant growth promotion capacity could have important practical implication for the selection of the best microbial inoculants to improve plant growth and crop yield. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - Bread wheat is one of the key food grains in Ethiopia. However, its production and productivity are affected by stripe rust. The objective of this study was to investigate and develop integrated management options for stripe rust using varieties and fungicide application frequency in the study area. A field experiment was conducted at Enarj Enawuga district in the Metaya Kebele farmer training center during the 2022 main cropping season. There were sixteen total treatment combinations [four bread wheat varieties (Ogolcho, Lemu, Hidase, and Local as check), and four Tilt 250 EC fungicide application frequencies (nil, 1, 2, and 3 times)]. The design of the experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with factorial arrangements within three replications. Both disease and yield-related data were collected and analyzed using SAS 9.4 software. The disease and yield parameters showed a significant (p < 0.01) difference, and all treated plots had higher yield and lower disease severity than untreated plots. On the untreated plots, the final mean stripe rust severity was 18.53%, 22.57%, 36.73%, and 57.63% on Ogolcho, Lemu, Hidase, and local varieties, respectively. The maximum disease control was recorded from Ogolcho variety (61.31%) with a three-time application of Tilt 250EC. Grain yield and thousand kernel weight increment were obtained at 79.72% and 17.37% from Ogolcho, 100% and 23.44% from Lemu, 94.85% and 34.54% from Hidase, and 102.85% and 49.56% from local varieties treated by three times of Tilt 250EC, respectively. A higher yield reduction and AUDPC (114 DAS) were recorded from untreated plots of local (50.70%, 2,031.49% days−1), and Hidase (48.68%, 1,020.6% days−1) varieties, receptively. The 15-day interval application frequency of Propiconazole increased the grain yield of all tested varieties and reduced stripe rust severity. The Ogolcho variety treated three times yielded the maximum net benefit (216,750 Birr/ha) with an accepted marginal rate of return (22,810%). Therefore, based on the results obtained, producers use the Ogolcho variety with three-time application of propiconazole fungicide for optimum wheat production and could be recommended to manage stripe rust in the study area. © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - The false codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta (Meyrick), is believed to have originated from Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, this pest has extensively spread and is found in most parts of Africa, with records in approximately 40 countries in over 100 host plant species. Despite Thaumatotibia leucotreta being the leading cause of interceptions of Capsicum and cut flowers exported by Kenya to the European Union, information on abundance and damage levels inflicted on capsicum is limited. The objective of the study was to assess the abundance and damage levels of T. leucotreta on capsicum in the selected counties in Lower Eastern Kenya (Kitui, Machakos, and Makueni counties). Higher T. leucotreta larval density per farm was recorded in Kitui County compared to other counties. In farms with capsicum only (not intercropped with other crops), the mean number of FCM larvae was relatively higher in Kitui. Farming practices such as the use of uncertified seeds and seedlings and the excessive use of pesticides may be the major contributors to high larval incidence in Kitui County. © 2023 by the authors.

N2  - A cross sectional and randomized controlled trial study was conducted starting from July 2021 to July 2022 to determine the prevalence of ixodid ticks, and evaluate the efficacy of commonly used acaricides (amitraz 12.5% and diazinon 60%) in vitro and in vivo on cattle ticks in Amibara district. A total of 372 cattle were visited randomly from six kebeles of the district which were selected based on their livestock population. A total of 4330 adult ticks were collected and identified to the species level with stereomicroscope. For the invitro acaricide efficacy test, 90 engorged female ticks were collected from infested herds and grouped into three, each group having ten engorged ticks; two groups for the two test acaricides and the third groups were control to evaluate these acaricides in the laboratory. All the groups were replicated three times and incubated for seven days with similar temperature and humidity. Thirty-six infested cattle were selected and again grouped into three randomly, 12 each for the invivo test. The first groups of animals were sprayed with amitraz, the second with diazinon and the third groups were left untreated. Ticks were counted and recorded before, day 3, day 7, day 14 and day 21 of spraying. A total of 360 (96.7%) of the visited cattle were infested with ticks. Amblyomma. Rhipicephallus, Hyalomma and Bophillus were the genera of ticks identified with a prevalence of 44.9%, 41.4%, 7.5% and 6.2% respectively. A total of 15 species of ixodid ticks were identified from which Rhipicephallus pulchellus (39.86%) was dominant followed by Amblyomma lepidum (26.65%) and Amblyomma gemma (14.36%). Diazinon 60% EC and amitraz 12.5% were significantly inhibited the egg laying ability of engorged ticks' in vitro with percent inhibition of 100% and 99.1% respectively. On live animal, both acaricides showed statistically significant difference from the control group (p- value <0.05) with maximum 97.37% (amitraz) and 93.33% (diazinon) at day 7 and minimum 73.3% (amitraz) and 73.7% (diazinon) efficacy. However, there was no statistically significant difference on egg laying inhibition and tick count reduction between the two acaricides (p-value >0.05). Therefore, awareness should be created about the high prevalence as well as the application, dosage and dilution of the acaricides to pastoralists, community animal health workers and para veterinarians in the study area. Cattle owners, veterinarians and concerned government officials should address infested herds with manufacturer recommended dosage of these acaricides to control the tick infestation.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Scale-up of malaria interventions seems to have contributed to a decline in the disease but other factors may also have had some role. Understanding changes in transmission and determinant factors will help to adapt control strategies accordingly. METHODS: Four sites in Ethiopia and Uganda were set up to monitor epidemiological changes and effectiveness of interventions over time. Here, results of a survey during the peak transmission season of 2012 are reported, which will be used as baseline for subsequent surveys and may support adaptation of control strategies. Data on malariometric and entomological variables, socio-economic status (SES) and control coverage were collected. RESULTS: Malaria prevalence varied from 1.4 % in Guba (Ethiopia) to 9.9 % in Butemba (Uganda). The most dominant species was Plasmodium vivax in Ethiopia and Plasmodium falciparum in Uganda. The majority of human-vector contact occurred indoors in Uganda, ranging from 83 % (Anopheles funestus sensu lato) to 93 % (Anopheles gambiae s.l.), which is an important factor for the effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS). High kdr-L1014S (resistance genotype) frequency was observed in A. gambiae sensu stricto in Uganda. Too few mosquitoes were collected in Ethiopia, so it was not possible to assess vector habits and insecticide resistance levels. ITN ownership did not vary by SES and 56-98 % and 68-78 % of households owned at least one ITN in Ethiopia and Uganda, respectively. In Uganda, 7 % of nets were purchased by households, but the nets were untreated. In three of the four sites, 69-76 % of people with access to ITNs used them. IRS coverage ranged from 84 to 96 % in the three sprayed sites. Half of febrile children in Uganda and three-quarters in Ethiopia for whom treatment was sought received diagnostic tests. High levels of child undernutrition were detected in both countries carrying important implications on child development. In Uganda, 7-8 % of pregnant women took the recommended minimum three doses of intermittent preventive treatment. CONCLUSION: Malaria epidemiology seems to be changing compared to earlier published data, and it is essential to have more data to understand how much of the changes are attributable to interventions and other factors. Regular monitoring will help to better interpret changes, identify determinants, modify strategies and improve targeting to address transmission heterogeneity.

N2  - BACKGROUND: There were about of 124 to 283 million cases of malaria with 367,000 to 755,000 deaths annually. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of malaria cases and associated risk factors among attendants at Chichu and Wonago health centers, South Ethiopia. METHODS: In this health institution based cross sectional study, 324 subjects, attendants from outpatient department who came for any kind of medical services, were included during May to June 2016. A blood film examination format and structured questionnaire were used for data collection. Peripheral blood samples were collected and the presence of malaria cases was observed microscopically. The collected data were analyzed by SPSS version 20.0. RESULTS: Malaria cases were detected in 91 (28.1%) of the participants with higher infection rate amongst (56.04%). The predominant Plasmodium species detected was P. vivax (52.75%) followed by P. falciparum (35.16%) and mixed malaria infection by both of the species (12.09%). Housing construction and not using of insecticide treated bed nets for the last 6 months were significantly associated with the risk of getting malaria. Individuals who had stagnant water in their compound were more likely to get malaria than those who did not (OR=1.87, 95% CI: 1.20, 2.76). Houses that had been sprayed with insecticide in the past 6 months were protected against malaria infection (OR=0.33, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.92). Moreover, bed net utilization was associated with a significantly lower risk of infection (OR=0.19, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.37). CONCLUSIONS: Type of housing construction, not using bed net, insecticide spraying and residing near stagnant water were associated risk factors with malaria positivity in the study area.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Since malaria is one of the foremost public health problems in Ethiopia, assessment of situation of the disease, and communities' knowledge and perceptions about malaria is necesary to institute appropriate preventive and control measures. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess malaria prevalence and knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) about the disease among ShewaRobit Town community, northeastern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Shewa Robit Town from October to November 2011. A multi-stage random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. A total of 425 individuals were examined for malaria using thin and thick Giemsa stained blood film, and 284 of the participants were interviewed to assess their KAP about malaria. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess predictor factors for malaria prevalence. RESULTS: All respondents had ever heard of malaria. Most of the respondents (85.2%) attributed the cause of malaria to mosquito bite. However, some of the respondents (>20%) mentioned lack of personal hygiene, exposure to cold weather, hunger, chewing maize stalk, body contact with malaria patient and flies as the causes of malaria. Sleeping under mosquito nets, draining stagnant water and indoor residual spraying were the most frequently mentioned malaria preventive measures perceived and practiced by the respondents. Among 425 individuals examined for malaria, only 2.8% were positive for Plasmodium parasites. Living in houses made of wall without hole, sprayed with insecticide within the last 12 hours and located at a distance of greater than 500 meters from potential mosquito breeding sites as well as knowing and using of mosquito net were significant predictors of low malaria prevalence among the study participants. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of knowledge about the cause, transmission and preventive methods of malaria was detected among the community in Shewa Robit Town. However, a considerable proportion had misconception about the cause and transmission of malaria suggesting the necessity of health education to raise the community's awareness about the disease.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: In Ethiopia, malaria is one of the major public health and socioeconomic problems, though tremendous efforts have been made. Currently, the country has a plan to eliminate malaria by 2030. To achieve this plan, epidemiological studies associated with malaria prevalence with gender, age groups, species types, and seasons are essential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of malaria from 2013 to 2021 in Addis Zemen town, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at assess the trend of malaria prevalence over the last nine years using recorded blood smear reports in the laboratory logbook from governmental health institutions. Trends in malaria cases and the proportion of genders, age groups, species, and seasons over time were compared. The data were analyzed using the SPSS-23 software package. RESULTS: The overall malaria prevalence between 2013 and 2021 was 10.4%. From all confirmed cases, the minimum and maximum prevalence of malaria cases were recorded in 2018 (2%) and 2016 (33.2%) years, respectively. The infectious rate of males (59.3%) was significantly higher than that of females (40.7%) (p < 0.0001). In all survey periods, all age groups were infected by malaria parasites; the majority of the cases were between 15 and 45 years (57%) older than others. Statistically, a greater proportion of P. falciparum (80.1%) was recorded than P. vivax (18.5%) (p < 0.0001). Malaria cases were occurring throughout each month. The relative highest peaks of total malaria cases were observed during the months of September, October, and November. Seasonally, the highest infection rate was observed during spring (40.20%) compared to other seasons. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the study revealed that malaria transmission remained high, which affected males more than females and potentially reproductive ages. Two of the most important Plasmodium species were identified and found during all reviewed months and years, though P. falciparum was the most prevalent. Hence, the problem can be alleviated by using season-based long-lasting insecticide treated nets, regularly overseeing ongoing irrigation activity, overseeing the reduction of the water level of the Sheni River, health education, and providing immediate patient treatment.

N2  - Small hive beetle (Aethina tumida Murray), indigenous to Africa, has spread to other parts of the world where has become a threat to the honeybee industry. In the present study, insecticidal properties (contact, fumigant, and repellent toxicities) of three main constituents derived from Trachyspermum ammi (L.) Sprague ex Turrill fruits essential oil were evaluated against adult small hive beetles under laboratory conditions. The Hydrodistillation of T. ammi fruits, grown in Ethiopia, yielded a pale yellow essential oil (3.5% v/w) with a strong aromatic odor. Analyses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry identified twenty-two compounds that accounted for 98.68% of the total essential oil. The essential oil was dominated by monoterpenoids, comprising γ-terpinene (32.72%), p-cymene (27.92%), and thymol (24.36%). The essential oil showed strong contact and fumigation toxicities against the small hive beetle adults, with a LD50 value of 66.64 µg/adult and a LC50 value of 89.03 mg/L air, respectively. Among the main constituents, thymol was the most toxic component found in both contact (LD50 = 41.79 µg/adult) and fumigation (LC50 = 52.66 mg/L air) toxicities. The other two components, γ-terpinene and p-cymene, were less effective in both contact and fumigant toxicities testing. The results showed that T. ammi essential oil and thymol could serve as potential alternatives to synthetic insecticides for the control of small hive beetle adults. © 2020 by the authors.

N2  - Malaria is one the leading health problem of the Ethiopia. Previously, areas above 2,000 m elevation were considered as malaria free areas. However, the major malaria epidemics were seen in areas at an altitude up to 3,000 m above sea level. These epidemics were due to climate and land-use changes (ecological changes) and still malaria is a growing health problem in highland parts of Ethiopia. This study aimed to investigate the species diversity, abundance and distribution of Anopheles mosquitoes in highland fringe of Bure district, Northwestern Ethiopia. It was done in the three different agroecological villages, Bukta (Irrigated), Workimdr (non-irrigated with few dry season breeding habitats) and Shnebekuma (non-irrigated with many dry season breeding habitats). Anopheles mosquitoes were collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Light Traps Catches, Pyrethrum Spray Catches, and Artificial Pit Shelters (APSs) from twenty-seven houses, thirty houses, and six APSs, respectively. Anopheles mosquitoes were identified morphologically to species using standard keys. Furthermore, molecular identification of Anopheles gambiae s.l was carried out using species-specific Polymerase Chain Reaction. Independent T-Test and One-way- ANOVA were employed to compare the mean mosquito's density between villages and species, indoor and outdoor host seeking mosquitoes. Descriptive statistic was used to calculate the proportion of each Anopheles species. Nine Anopheles mosquito species were identified in the study area which includes: Anopheles demeilloni, An. arabiensis, An. funestus group, An. coustani, An. squamosus, An. cinereus, An. pharoensis, An. rupicolus, and An. natalensis. Of the 4,703 Anopheles mosquitoes collected, An. demeilloni was the most prominent (50.7%, n = 2383) whereas An. rupicolus (0.03%, n = 3), and An. natalensis (0.02%, n = 1) were the least abundant. Higher mean density of Anopheles mosquitoes was collected from the non-irrigated village (2.395 ± 0.100) than irrigated (1.351 ± 0.109) (p = 0.001). In conclusion, three of the most important malaria vectors (An. arabiensis, An. funestus group and An. pharoensis) of Ethiopia were recorded in the study sites, especially the first two was found thought-out the year. Most of the Anopheles mosquitoes were collected from non-irrigated villages. Thus, breeding habitat management must be practiced throughout the year together with long-lasting insecticide-treated nets and insecticide residual sprays.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Globally, acute malnutrition threatens the lives of several million children under 5 years of age. Malnutrition affects the social, economic, and medical aspects of all countries. In Ethiopia, acute malnutrition is not decreasing at the intended rate for unclear reasons. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the burden of acute malnutrition and its associated factors among children under 5 years of age in a rural setting of southern Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January to March 2022. A multistage sampling technique was used to select 421 children. Mothers/caretakers were interviewed using interviewer-administered questionnaire, while their children's height/length and weight were measured. Logistic regression analyses were used and presented as the crude odds ratio (COR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The burden of acute malnutrition among children under 5 years of age in the study area was 22.6% (95% CI = 18.5-26.8). Fathers with primary education (AOR = 4.48; 95% CI = 1.93-10.39), households with improper solid waste disposal (AOR = 2.54; 95% CI = 1.11-5.82), not usually sleeping under insecticide-treated bed net (ITN) (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.01-3.19), unacceptable children dietary diversity score (DDS) (AOR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.28-5.14), and unacceptable household DDS (AOR = 2.26; 95% CI = 1.02-5.00) were factors associated with acute malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of acute malnutrition among children was critically high. Upgrading paternal educational status, encouraging safe solid waste disposal, ensuring consistent use of ITN, and improving both child and household DDS should be stressed. Plain language titleVery High Level of Acute Malnutrition and Related Factors Among Children Under 5 Years in the Rural Parts of Southern EthiopiaPlain language summaryWhy was the study done?Acute malnutrition is a cause of death for several million children under 5 years of age in the world. It affects the social, economic, and medical features of all countries. In Ethiopia, acute malnutrition is not decreasing at the intended rate for unclear reasons. Numerous studies in the country reported varying level on acute malnutrition in spite of similarities in the study area and time. Therefore, this study aimed to find out the level of acute malnutrition and related factors among children under 5 years of age in rural parts of southern Ethiopia.What did the researchers do?The research team selected 421 representative children and collected information by asking their mothers/caretakers some relevant questions, and by weighing and measuring their height. Then, the collected information was computed by a computer software.What did the researchers find?One out of 5 children in the rural parts of southern Ethiopia had acute malnutrition. Educational status of fathers, households with inappropriate solid waste, not usually sleeping under mosquito bed net, low level of children and household food variety were factors related to acute malnutrition.What do the findings mean?The level of acute malnutrition among children in the study area was very high. Educating fathers, encouraging safe solid waste disposal, ensuring consistent use of mosquito bed net, and improving both the level of children and household food variety should be underlined. eng

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains one of the major public health concerns in Ethiopia. Use of long- lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is the country's key malaria prevention and control strategy. This study intended to determine access to and usage gap of LLINs in malaria endemic settings in Southwestern Ethiopia. METHODS: Data were collected from 798 households in three districts (Mana, Kersa and Goma) of Jimma Zone, Southwestern Ethiopia, from December 2013 to January 2014. The data were analyzed using SPSS software package version 17.0. LLINs ownership, access and utilization gap were determined following the procedure developed by Survey and Indicator Task Force of the Roll Back Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group. To complement the quantitative data, focus group discussions and interviews were conducted with community groups and key informants. RESULTS: In this study, 70.9% (95% CI: 67.8-74.1%) of the surveyed households had at least one LLIN, and 63.0% (95% CI: 59.6-66.3%) had sufficient LLINs for every member of the household. With respect to access, 51.9% (95% CI: 50.5-53.5%) of the population had access to LLIN. Only, 38.4% (95% CI: 36.9-39.9%) had slept under LLIN the previous night with females and children having priority to sleep under LLIN. This gave an overall use to access ratio of 70.2% which resulted in behavior-driven failure of 29.8%. Of the households with sufficient LLIN access, females (AOR = 1.52; 95% CI:1.25-1.83; P = 0.001) and children aged 0-4 years (AOR = 2.28; 95 % CI:1.47-3.53;P = 0.001) were more likely to use LLINs than other household members. Shape of nets, sleeping arrangements, low risk perception, saving nets for future use, awareness and negligence, and perception of low efficacy of the LLINs contributed to behavioral failures. CONCLUSIONS: LLIN use was hampered by lack of ownership and most importantly by behavioral driven gaps. This calls for designing and implementing appropriate behavioral change communication strategies to address behavioral failure. Improving access to LLINs also needs attention. Further, it requires moving beyond the traditional messaging approach for evidence based intervention to address specific needs and gaps.

N2  - In Ethiopia, malaria incidence has significantly reduced in the past decade through the combined use of conventional vector control approaches and treatment using antimalarial drugs. However, the sustainability of this achievement is threatened by the shift in biting and resting behaviors and emergence of insecticide resistance by the primary malaria vector. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the behaviour of malaria mosquitoes in different sentinel sites is crucial to design effective prevention and control methods in the local context. Entomological investigations were conducted in three sentinel sites for five consecutive months during the major malaria transmission season. The species composition, population dynamics, biting and resting behaviours of malaria vectors were determined using center for disease control and prevention (CDC) light trap, human landing catch (HLC), pyrethrum spray catch (PSC) and Pitfall shelter collection (PFS). Accordingly, 10 households for CDC, 10 households for PSC, 10 households for PFS and 5 households for HLC from each site were randomly enrolled for mosquito collection. A total of 8,297 anopheline mosquitoes were collected from the three sites, out of which 4,525 (54.5 %) were An. gambiae, s.l. 2,028 (24.4 %) were An. pharoensis, 160 (1.9 %) were An. funestus and the rest 1,584 (19 %) were other anophelines (An. coustani, An. cinerus and An. tenebrosus). No significant variation (P = 0.476) was observed between indoor (25.2/trap-night and outdoor collections (20.1/trap-night). Six hundred seventy six (43.3%) of An. gambiae s.l. (primary vector) were collected between 18:00 and 22:00 h. Biting activity declined between 00:00 and 02:00 h. The national malaria control program should pay close attention to the shifting behavior of vector mosquitoes as the observed outdoor feeding tendency of the vector population could pose challenges to the indoor intervention tools IRS and LLINs.

N2  - Aluminum phosphide is a fumigant pesticide produced in tablet form. Aluminum phosphide releases phosphine (phi) gas, which primarily affects cellular respiration by blocking cytochrome oxidation in the mitochondria. In a two-month case series collected in 2016 (April and May), seven patients with a complaint of aluminum Phosphide poisoning were evaluated at the Addis Ababa Burn Emergency and Trauma Hospital. Four of the patients were female. The ages of the patients ranged from 16 to 33 with an average age of 25. The patients presented to the hospital no earlier than four hours post exposure. Five of the seven patients were farmers. Though the patients were in shock, they were able to provide a history supplemented by the people that brought them to the Emergency Room (ER). They had non-specific manifestations of poisoning including nausea, vomiting, and epigastric and retrosternal pain. In addition, six of the seven patients were in shock. Supportive management with crystalloid resuscitation, ionotropic support, magnesium sulphate, calcium gluconate, hydrocortisone and mechanical ventilation were administered as needed. Five of the seven patients (71%) died in the hospital within 24 hours of ingestion. Because of its lethality; control of the distribution of Aluminum Phosphide in conjunction with the training of health care professionals on early supportive management are essential and may decrease mortality from ingestion of this substance.

N2  - A literature review is provided on the state of knowledge of the ecology and control of the sand fly vectors of Leishmania donovani in East Africa, with a special emphasis on Phlebotomus orientalis. Visceral leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani is a major health problem in several areas in East Africa. Studies conducted in the past 70 years identified P. orientalis Parrot and P. martini Parrot as the principal vectors of L. donovani in Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya and P. celiae Minter as the secondary vector of the parasite in one focus in Ethiopia. Findings on sand fly fauna and other circumstantial evidence indicate that P. martini is also responsible for transmission of L. donovani in VL endemic foci of Somalia and Uganda. Several studies showed that P. orientalis occupy distinct habitat characterized by black cotton soil and Acacia seyal-Balanites aegyptiaca vegetation, whereas P. martini and P. celiae are associated with termite mounds. Little knowledge exists on effective control measures of sand fly vectors of L. donovani in East Africa. However, recent evidence showed that use of insecticide impregnated bednets and insect repellents may reduce exposure to the bites of P. orientalis.

N2  - Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is an insecticide, a member of dirty dozen persistent organic pollutants, used widely in the world until it was banned in the 1970s.The banning of DDT was strengthened by the Stockholm Convention in 2001. DDT is allowed only for malaria control in Ethiopia. However, farmers are misusing DDT and applying it to Khat (Catha edulis) farming. So, this review analyzes available data in the literature on the current trend, application, occurrence, fate and effects of DDT and its metabolites, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), in the chewable parts of Khat. Generally, the concentration level of DDT, DDD, and DDE, designated as DDTs, is detected in different farmlands of Ethiopia. Some of the DDTs concentrations detected are very high (141.2-973 μg/kg (Gelemso), 194.4-999 μg/kg (Aseno) and 6253-8413.3 μg/kg (Gurage), and these concentrations may indicate increasing recent unmonitored application of DDT on Khat leaves. Some of the detected concentrations of DDT in the literature were above the maximum residue limit (MRL) set by FAO/WHO (100 μg/kg) and the European Commission 10 μg/kg in vegetables and 50 μg/kg in cereals. DDT exposure of Khat chewers linked to the concentration of DDT on Khat leaves and the amount of Khat consumed. DDT might pose health risks to chewers due to chronic toxicity, bioaccumulation, persistent and endocrine disruption properties.

N2  - Questions: Woody plant encroachment is known to adversely affect the biodiversity and functioning of savannah ecosystems, yet removal strategies have been shown to have variable success. Here, we evaluated the effectiveness of three woody removal methods or treatments for controlling the leguminous thorny shrub Dichrostachys cinerea, and assessed plant community responses following removal. Location: Savannah plains of Nech Sar National Park, South-Ethiopian rift valley. Methods: Based on a total of seventy-two 10 m × 10 m experimental plots spread across six blocks, we carried out: (a) stump burning; (b) stump application with glyphosate herbicide; and (c) mechanical uprooting on D. cinerea, and monitored the number, height, and thickness of resprouts and the number of resprouting stumps for two consecutive years. In addition, we surveyed all vascular plant species per plot for each removal method and control. Results: We found that the uprooting treatment resulted in a higher number of resprouting stumps and lower number of resprouts, and a smaller resprout height and diameter. The fire treatment showed the greatest reduction in the number of resprouting stumps and resprouts, whereas glyphosate treatment showed intermediate results although resprout height and diameter were significantly greater compared with the uprooting treatment. Whereas plant species richness and diversity were higher in the fire treatment, they were adversely affected in the uprooting treatment. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that none of the woody removal methods were effective enough to completely eradicate D. cinerea from the field trials after only one intervention, suggesting the need for follow-up management actions considering their impacts on both woody encroachment and biodiversity restoration. © 2023 International Association for Vegetation Science.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of insecticide resistance in the major African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles arabiensis may compromise control initiatives based on insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) or indoor residual spraying (IRS), and thus threaten the global malaria elimination strategy. METHODS: We investigated pyrethroid resistance in four populations of An. arabiensis from south-western Ethiopia and then assessed the bio-efficacy of six World Health Organization recommended long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) using these populations. RESULTS: For all four populations of An. arabiensis, bottle bioassays indicated low to moderate susceptibility to deltamethrin (mortality at 30 minutes ranged between 43 and 80%) and permethrin (mortality ranged between 16 and 76%). Pre-exposure to the synergist piperonylbutoxide (PBO) significantly increased the susceptibility of all four populations to both deltamethrin (mortality increased between 15.3 and 56.8%) and permethrin (mortality increased between 11.6 and 58.1%), indicating the possible involvement of metabolic resistance in addition to the previously identified kdr mutations. There was reduced susceptibility of all four An. arabiensis populations to the five standard LLINs tested (maximum mortality 81.1%; minimum mortality 13.9%). Bio-efficacy against the four populations varied by net type, with the largest margin of difference observed with the Jimma population (67.2% difference). Moreover, there were differences in the bio-efficacy of each individual standard LLIN against the four mosquito populations; for example there was a difference of 40% in mortality of Yorkool against two populations. Results from standard LLINs indicated reduced susceptibility to new, unused nets that was likely due to observed pyrethroid resistance. The roof of the combination LLIN performed optimally (100% mortality) against all the four populations of An. arabiensis, indicating that observed reductions in susceptibility could be ameliorated with the combination of PBO with deltamethrin, as used in PermaNet® 3.0. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that bio-efficacy evaluations using local mosquito populations should be conducted where possible to make evidence-based decisions on the most suitable control products, and that those combining multiple chemicals such as PBO and deltamethrin should be considered for maintaining a high level of efficacy in vector control programmes.

N2  - The effects of pesticides are largely a function of toxicity, exposure time, dose rate and its persistence in the environment. Previous studies conducted in the study area mainly focused on the knowledge, attitude and practices of farmers against implementation of pesticide safety instructions during application and storing the pesticides. Hence, the objectives of the present study were to assess the pesticides applied on crops per a cropping season; the pesticide application practices of farmers and the health risks of pesticide residues on humans and the ecosystems. Quantitative data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics, and qualitative data were grouped and summarized. The findings of the study confirmed that crops were sprayed with pesticides up to 26 times per a cropping season. A hectare of farmland might be sprayed more than 14 kg and 28 kg of pesticides per a cropping season and per a year. In addition to solid formulations, farmers used more than four liters of pesticides per crop per hectare. Farmers sprayed highly toxic pesticides without following the safety instructions and supplied the sprayed crops without waiting for the post-spray time interval. Most pesticides used in the district are in the lists of highly hazardous pesticides and are highly toxic to aquatic organisms including fish. There were also practices of fishing using pesticides in rivers of Fogera District and symptoms of surface water pollution used for drinking. Hence, pesticide residues might be one of the major health risks for farmworkers, consumers and ecosystems of the District. Therefore, monitoring the pesticide supply chain starting from suppliers to end users, continuous ecosystem assessment and food safety monitoring using GC-MS are needed to minimize the effects of pesticide residues on human health and the ecosystems. © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - Objective This study aims to estimate the prevalence of neural tube defects (NTDs) and to identify potential risk factors in the Ethiopian context. Study design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Study participants A total of 611 064 participants were included in the review obtained from 42 studies. Methods PubMed (Medline), Embase and Cochrane Library databases in combination with other potential sources of literature were systematically searched, whereby studies conducted between January 2010 and December 2022 were targeted in the review process. All observational studies were included and heterogeneity between studies was verified using Cochrane Q test statistics and I 2 test statistics. Small study effects were checked using Egger's statistical test at a 5% significance level. Result The pooled prevalence of all NTDs per 10 000 births in Ethiopia was 71.48 (95% CI 57.80 to 86.58). The between-study heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 97.49%, p<0.0001). Birth prevalence of spina bifida (33.99 per 10 000) was higher than anencephaly (23.70 per 10 000), and encephalocele (4.22 per 10 000). Unbooked antenatal care (AOR 2.26, 95% CI (1.30 to 3.94)), preconception intake of folic acid (AOR 0.41, 95% CI (0.26 to 0.66)), having chronic medical illness (AOR 2.06, 95% CI (1.42 to 2.99)), drinking alcohol (AOR 2.70, 95% CI (1.89 to 3.85)), smoking cigarette (AOR 2.49, 95% CI (1.51 to 4.11)), chewing khat (AOR 3.30, 95% CI (1.88 to 5.80)), exposure to pesticides (AOR 3.87, 95% CI (2.63 to 5.71)), maternal age ≥35 (AOR 1.90, 95% CI (1.13 to 3.25)), maternal low educational status (AOR 1.60, 95% CI (1.13 to 2.24)), residing in urban areas (AOR 0.75, 95% CI (0.58 to 0.97))and family history of NTDs (AOR 2.51, 95% CI (1.36 to 4.62)) were associated with NTD cases. Conclusion The prevalence of NTDs in Ethiopia is seven times as high as in other Western countries where prevention measures are put in place. Heredity, maternal and environmental factors are associated with a high prevalence of NTDs. Mandatory fortification of staple food with folic acid should be taken as a priority intervention to curb the burden of NTDs. To smoothen and overlook the pace of implementation of mass fortification, screening, and monitoring surveillance systems should be in place along with awareness-raising measures.

N2  - Yellow rust disease caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici is one of the major threats to wheat production in Ethiopia. In this paper, the impact of yellow rust on the physical qualities of bread wheat was studied. For this purpose, combinations of four bread wheat varieties (Digalu, Hidase, Danda'a, and Honkolo) and two fungicides (Nativo SC 300 and Tilt® 250E.C.) were tested at two different hotspot areas (Albazar and Alicho) in the Silte Zone, Southern Ethiopia, under natural epidemics of the disease during the 2018 growing season. A randomized complete block design in factorial arrangement with three replications was used to set up the experiment. A significant (p <.01) increase in hectoliters weight and wet gluten content were observed due to the application of Nativo SC 300; however, grain protein content did not respond significantly (p >.01) at both locations. Wheat varieties with high yellow rust severity exhibited maximum values of area under the disease progress curve and physical quality loss percentage (%). The highly susceptible wheat variety Digalu exhibited the highest values of hectoliter weight losses (%), and the actual losses ranged from 5.5% to 29.5%. Except for grain protein content, there was a significant negative correlation between the values of terminal rust severity, average coefficient infection, and area under the disease progress curve and that of hectoliters weight and wet gluten content, with correlation coefficients ranging from −0.85** to −0.33**. It is possible to improve the physiochemical properties of bread wheat through the application of foliar fungicides by selecting the appropriate genotypes that have an acceptable level of resistance to yellow rust. © 2024 The Authors.

N2  - Faba bean is an important food legume crop that is consumed in various forms of diets across the world, including Ethiopia. However, productivity of the crop is affected by faba bean gall (Physoderma viciae) disease in the highlands of Ethiopia. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate an integrated effect of fungicide applications, moderately resistant varieties, and intercropping on gall disease epidemic and yield of faba bean at Farta, Ethiopia, during the 2019 and 2020 cropping seasons. Three Bayleton (triadimefon) fungicide applications (foliar spray, seed treatment, foliar spray + seed treatment) plus a control, three faba bean varieties, and two intercropping systems with sole cropping were used as treatments and arranged in a split-split plot design with three replications. Significant (p < 0.01) variations in gall disease components and faba bean yield were observed among treatments. Intercropping and the use of Bayleton applications in combination with the varieties Degaga and Tumsa reduced disease development and increased grain yield. The gall disease severity was reduced by spray applications at 90 days after planting. Intercropping of moderately resistant varieties Degaga and Tumsa with wheat and mustard significantly lowered the gall disease progression as compared to Bulga 70-wheat and -mustard intercropping in seed-treated plots. Integration of three sprays of Bayleton with Degaga provided the highest yield (5.27 t ha−1), followed by integrating foliar sprays + seed treatment with Degaga (4.97 t ha−1), and both treatments had higher net benefits than others in both years. Thus, integrating Bayleton as a seed treatment (1.5 g kg−1 of seeds) with moderately resistant varieties Degaga and Tumsa in both sole and intercropping systems could be used as cost-effective and environmentally safe management options. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Field trials were conducted to evaluate wheat varieties and fungicides against yellow rust of wheat. Four wheat varieties (Digalu, Hidase, Danda’a, Honkolo) and two fungicides (Nativo SC 300, Tilt 250EC) were tested at two hotspot areas (Albazar and Alicho) of Southern Ethiopia. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design in a factorial arrangement with three replications. Nativo SC 300 resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) grain yield increment of 51%, 178.4% and 528.5% at Albazar and 85%, 206.1% and 586.2% at Alicho on the treated plot of Danda’a, Hidase and Digalu, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between disease parameters and grain yield. Based on cost-benefit analysis, application of fungicides was cost effective in controlling the disease. The resistant variety Honkolo and Nativo SC 300 can be used for management of yellow rust and improve yield of wheat. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the district-level malaria transmission stratification has indicated the Northern, Northwestern, Southern, and rift valley lowland and surrounding highland districts are almost entirely classified as high or moderate malaria transmission zones. Conducting malaria surveillance to track, test, and treat all malaria cases cannot be implemented in Ethiopia in the current situation. OBJECTIVE: To show malaria transmission dynamics in different health facilities located from 1800 to 2772 m altitudes during 2018-2021 in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 3.5 years (2018-2021) retrospective confirmed and treated malaria cases in 43 kebeles health posts and clinics in Gondar Zuria district were used for analysis. RESULT: The total malaria count was 5893 for 2019 compared to 31, 550 for 2020 and 33, 248 for 2021. Mean monthly malaria incidence/1000 people in 2019 was 2.39 ± 5.4 and increased to 10.64 ± 16.99 in 2020 and 11.19 ± 16.59 in 2021. Annual malaria incidence increased from 24 cases/1000 people in 2019 to 139.08 cases/1000 people in 2021 and is alarming danger in malaria elimination program in the district or the country as a whole. Poisson and Negative binomial regressions models indicated 5.78- and 5.26-fold malaria cases increase, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2019. The sudden increase in malaria incidences (counts) in 2020 and 2021 coincided with the interruption of residual insecticide application in Gondar Zuria district during the transition period towards the malaria pre-elimination stage implicating the role of malaria control tools in suppressing transmission. Study on climate variability also indicated that the rainfall variability in different months might have also favored high malaria transmission in 2020 and 2021 compared to 2019. Thus, in addition to re-starting the use of malaria control tools, giving attention to climate anomalies (variability) that favors malaria transmission, for prompt interventional actions, is required. The malaria elimination program in Ethiopia might have not reached a pre-elimination stage as malaria cases per 1000 people have not decreased below five in the majority of Ethiopian districts. Tracing, confirming, and treating individual cases to stop further transmission is, almost, impossible. In a situation like this, the Ethiopian malaria elimination program should work intensively towards understanding malaria epidemiology at the district level to re-design a localized malaria control strategy. The renewed malaria control program should also consider altitudes above 2000 m.

N2  - Active detection of asymptomatic malaria cases and resolution of associated factors are essential for malaria elimination. There are no nationwide estimates for asymptomatic malaria and associated factors in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aims to generate comprehensive and conclusive evidence from various studies conducted in Ethiopia. Published articles from various electronic databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, CINAHL, Scopes, Cochrane Library, the Web of Science, and African Journals Online were accessed. Also, unpublished studies from Addis Ababa digital library were identified. All observational study designs were included in the search. Data were extracted on the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using STATA version 14.1. A random-effects model was fitted to estimate the pooled prevalence of asymptomatic malaria. A meta-regression and subgroup analysis was computed to see heterogeneity. The publication bias was assessed by the funnel plots and Egger's statistical tests. The analysis found that the pooled burden of asymptomatic malaria was 6.7 (95% confidence interval = 4.60, 8.79). The pooled prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum was 3.75 (95% confidence interval = 2.25, 5.18), and that of Plasmodium vivax was 2.22 (95% confidence interval = 1.46, 2.99). Factors such indoor residual spray service (odds ratio = 0.46; 95% confidence interval = 0.26, 0.81), never used insecticide-treated nets (odds ratio = 6.36; 95% confidence interval = 4.01, 10.09), and presence of stagnant water in the vicinity (odds ratio = 3.24; 95% confidence interval = 1.20, 8.71) were found to have a significant association with asymptomatic malaria. This study highlighted that pooled prevalence of asymptomatic malaria is high and varied by population groups. Prevalence of asymptomatic malaria was increased among those who never used insecticide-treated nets and were living near stagnant water by six and three times, respectively. The use of more sensitive diagnostic methods could yield a higher burden of the disease. Furthermore, active case detection is recommended for effective intervention toward elimination.

N2  - The study was aimed to investigate the beekeeping dynamics and its driving forces of change in the mixed farming system of Northwest Ethiopia. The research approaches include use of secondary and primary data. The primary data was collected; including key informant interviews, focus group discussions, workshops and field observation. The data was collected for a time frame of 10 years (from 2002-2012). Qualitative data analysis was done by using the ATLAS-ti version 7 software. The most important changes in all three watersheds during 2002-2012 were: reduction in honeybee colony size per household and decline in honey production; the adoption of movable-frame and top-bar hives were limited; few attempts by beekeepers to improve honeybee colony management practices; reduction in honeybee floral resources; increase in honeybee pests and predators attack and agrochemicals exposure. These changes are driven by the interaction of various driving forces that can be categorized into political (policy, institutional), economic, social, technological and ecological. Therefore, improvement of the beekeeping in the mixed farming system demands the commitment and action of stakeholders (farmers, development practitioners, researchers, policy makers, etc.) to change the influence of the various driving forces for the better. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Poison is a substance that can hurt or cause dysfunction in the body due to its chemical action. Poisoning related to pesticides used in agriculture is a major public health issue in developing countries. However, there is a limited epidemiological data on poisoning in Ethiopia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine poisoning patterns, clinical outcome, and factors associated with poisoned patients in Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in July 2021 to include data of 1 year period. Data of all poisoned patients were collected using a standardized checklist from the registration book and patient medical records. The association between variables and outcomes was analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered to declare a statistically significant association. RESULT: Over one-third of the poisoning cases (35.9%) were seen in the spring, according to a survey of 315 patient medical data. The majority of patients were in the age group of 21-30 years (44.1%). The most common form of poison consumed was organophosphate (OP), which accounts for 61.3% of all visits, and the least common was food poisoning, which accounts for 1.9%. About 82.5% of poisoning cases survived, while the remaining 17.5% were died. Time of arrival to the hospital ≥1 h (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 7.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16, 11.40), lack of oxygen support (AOR = 6.64; 95% CI: 3.56-6.78), and lack of adrenaline/dopamine medication (AOR = 3.57; 95% CI: 1.17-5.78) were all substantially linked with death of poisoned cases. CONCLUSIONS: Three-fourth of poisoning cases survived, while the remaining one-fourth died. Ingestion of OPs is the most prevalent type of poisoning, and most cases are intentional. Delayed arrival ≥1 h, lack of oxygen support, and adrenaline/dopamine treatment were all linked to death. On-time arrival, oxygen assistance, and adrenaline/dopamine treatment in a healthcare setting are all recommended.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) access-use has been pivotal monitoring indicator for malaria prevention and control, particularly in resource limited settings. The objective of the study was to compare ITN access-use based on universal household and population indicators and measures adapted to sleeping spaces. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in five districts of Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, March, 2019. 762 HHs were sampled for the survey. Multi-stage followed by simple random sampling used. Monitoring and evaluation reference group's (MERG's) indicators were used for measuring ITN access-use. MERG's indicators are each adapted ITN access-use to sleeping spaces. Household (ownership, saturation and sufficiency) and population access and household members' status of last night sleeping under ITN compared based on the two models. Differences of estimates of ITN access-use based on the two methods reported as magnitude of over/under estimations, at p-value < 0.05. RESULTS: Based on MERG's approach, the study revealed household (HH) based indicators as such: HH ownership of at least 1 ITN (92.6%), sufficiency of ITN for every two people in HH (50.3%), and saturation of ITN for every 2 people in HHs with any ITN (54.6%). Moreover, population based indicators were: population with ITN access (P3 = 78.6%), people who slept under ITN previous night (63.0%), people who slept under ITN among who accessed it (73.1%), ITN use-gap (26.9%). Equivalent indicators of HH ownership, sufficiency, saturation, and people accessed at where they actually slept, and people slept under ITN among those accessed at where they slept estimated at 71.3%, 49.4%, 69.3%, 66.3%, and 92.1%, respectively. MERG's approach over-estimated ownership, people's access, and behaviour-failures by 21.3%, 12.3%, 19.0%, respectively. Over-estimation occurred for reasons such as many sleeping spaces lack ITN and > 2 people actually slept per sleeping space. CONCLUSIONS: MERG's universal indicators over estimated households and populations ITN access-use as a result of absence of measures capturing access-use values at spaces where people actually slept. Consequently, measures adapted to sleeping contexts revealed potential misdistributions practiced when the existing indicators are in use. Insertion of sleeping spaces into existing approach will be worthwhile and needs to be promoted as it improves curiosity in ITN distribution, produces closer estimates and prevents malaria prevention and control programmes from overlooking access-use challenges.

N2  - This study aimed to determine the residual levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in chewable (tender leaves) and leftovers (mature leaves) of khat sold in local markets in Jimma town, southwest Ethiopia. Samples were collected from various local khat market places in Jimma town, based on their growing origin. A modified QuEChERS method was used to extract pesticides from the samples before their analysis by GC‒MS. The findings indicated that p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p’-DDE) and p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p’-DDT) were detected in 88.3% and 76.6% of chewable samples, and in 86% and 69% of khat leftovers samples. The p,p’-DDE and p,p’-DDT levels found in chewable khat ranged from 10.12–45.39 and 8.53–34.15 µg/kg, respectively. While in leftover khat they ranged from 30.12–45.04 and 6.73–32.16 µg/kg, respectively. It was found that the concentration of p,p’-DDE is greater than its precursor compound p,p’-DDT for each sample, indicating past use of DDT in the study area. None of the detected analytes exceeded the maximum residue level (MRL) values established by the FAO/WHO or European Commission (EC) of 50 µg/kg. However, no information is available regarding these pesticides’ collective and synergetic negative impacts on consumers. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Mosquito-borne viral diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya, and yellow fever have been documented in Ethiopia since the 1960s. However, the efficacy of public health insecticides against Aedes aegypti that transmits these viruses remains poorly understood in the country, particularly in the Afar Region. Thus, the aim of the study was to assess the susceptibility status of Ae. aegypti to deltamethrin, permethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, pirimiphos-methyl, bendiocarb, and propoxur insecticides. Larvae and pupae of Aedes species were collected from Awash Arba, Awash Sebat, and Werer towns of the Afar Region of Ethiopia during July-October 2022, brought to the Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology, insectary and reared to adults. Non-blood-fed, 3-5 days-old females Ae. aegypti were exposed to pyrethroid, carbamate, and organophosphate insecticide impregnated papers in tube test following the standard guidelines. Knockdown rates were noted at 10 minutes interval until one hour. The mortality in mosquitoes was recorded 24 hours after 60 minutes of exposure. The mortality rates of Ae. aegypti exposed to propoxur were 87% in all the study towns. Similarly, 88% mortality in Ae. aegypti was recorded when tested with bendiocarb in Awash Sebat and Awash Arba towns. Suspected resistance of Ae. aegypti (95% mortality) to alpha-cypermethrin was observed in Awash Arba town. However, Ae. aegypti collected from all the three sites was observed to be susceptible to deltamethrin, permethrin, and pirimiphos-methyl. Ae. aegypti was resistant to 0.1% bendiocarb and 0.1% propoxur and possibly resistant to 0.05% alpha-cypermethrin. On the other hand, it was susceptible to 0.05% deltamethrin, 0.75% permethrin, and 0.25% pirimiphos-methyl. Thus, vector control products with deltamethrin, permethrin, and pirimiphos-methyl can be used in the control of adult Ae. aegypti in the Afar Region of Ethiopia. However, further studies should be carried out to evaluate the susceptibility status of Ae. aegypti to alpha-cypermethrin in the Awash Arba area.

N2  - The role of farmers’ perception on climate change and their willingness to adapt are known. However, farmers’ perceptions are rarely considered in policy program approaches to improve food security. The research focuses on Ethiopia, which has been supported by many food security programs over the past decades, including the globally funded the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) that provides cash or food transfer to eight million chronically food-insecure people in periods of drought. Many of these food security programs are now exploring how to climate proof their approaches. Better understanding of the complex dynamics between farmers’ perceptions on climate change, the adaptation they are taking, and the socio-economic, geographical, and institutional context is helpful to recommend to climate-proof food security programs and interventions. The Ethiopian lowlands of the Arsi Negele district located in the Oromia Regional State are known for its bimodal rainfall. Farmers’ majors sources of livelihood are rainfed crop production and livestock. In this district, all interviewed farmers noticed changes at least in one of the climate variables over the past 30 years. In agreement with meteorological data, most farmers perceive an increasing trend in temperature. On the other hand, the common perception of increasing rainfall amounts conflicts with the observed data. In particular female farmers and farmers that are not member of farmer association have more conflicting perceptions on actual climate change. Perception and behavior are correlating with on-farm income, gender, and access to institutional services like farmers’ cooperative membership, and these elements should be included in food security approaches to become more climate proof. The different adaptation measures like application of pesticide and herbicide, fertilizer use, crop diversification, and adopting improved crop varieties were examined, and the key channels that may have encouraged farmers to adopt these mechanisms have been explored. These adaptation measures were mainly taken by farmers that were member of cooperatives, could access weather, and were located in specific areas. This implies the need to design targeted developmental interventions that consider the diversity of perceptions within the lowland agroecology of the Arsi Negele district. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

N2  - One of the most dramatic consequences of the current Argentine crisis is the suffering of millions of hungry people who have experienced a widespread decline in their living conditions. In 2001, at the height of the crisis, over half the population - 20 million persons, according to official figures - was living below the poverty line. Around one in four was suffering extreme poverty, meaning that their income was insufficient to cover their basic food needs, something unprecedented in the social and economic history of Argentina. This panorama was reinforced by media coverage of children starving, either because their parents could not care for them or because of a lack of assistance from the state. This situation is nothing short of scandalous if we consider that Argentina has an enormous potential for producing sufficient food in quantity and quality to feed several times the country's total population, and that in recent decades there has been a sustained and dramatic increase in agricultural production - mainly of cereals and oilseeds. The country's estimated annual production of cereals and oilseeds is over 70 million tons, almost two tons per capita, with a total of 90 million tons of agricultural produce in general. But these figures come with a caveat: almost half of the country's grain production is soy, virtually all of it genetically modified and for export. Historically one of the "breadbaskets of the world," Argentina was one of the few Third World countries self-sufficient in food, as well as an important net exporter of grain and other commodities to the world economy. How then can it be explained that a country like Argentina has become submerged in hunger and misery? How could this increase in agricultural production and overall supply of food be accompanied by a significant increase in hunger and poverty? Or, even more dramatically, why is it that one hundred children a day die of hunger in one of the "breadbaskets of the world"? What was the role played in all this by the dramatic boom in the production of genetically modified soybeans? A useful point of departure for considering these problems is the approach outlined by Amartya Sen in his analysis of famines occurring throughout the world. According to Sen, extreme food shortages and famines occur when the population loses its access to food entitlements. Entitlements are what allow the population to obtain certain goods, in this case the food necessary to cover basic food (nutritional) needs. Sen criticizes the FAO and other international organizations for focusing almost exclusively on the promotion of agricultural output. He argues that famine occurs not necessarily because of a lack of food but rather because large sections of society do not have access to it. A famine is a situation in which many people have no food to eat. This is not the same as saying that the community lacks sufficient food resources (see Sen 1981; Sen 1997 [1984], Chaps. 18, 19, 20; Teubal and Rodriguez 2002, Chap. 8). In Sen's terms, Argentina suffered the collapse of her food entitlement relations, that is, the capacity large sectors of society had for covering their basic (food) nutritional needs. In this sense, the 'Argentine case" may be read as a model case study of hunger in the presence of an abundant supply of food resources. Unlike other countries, Argentina experienced the collapse of her food security - the capacity to supply all her inhabitants with good quality food - although this was not necessarily comparable to the famines occurring in the 1970s, for example, in Bangladesh or Ethiopia (Sen 1981). Nevertheless, as is pointed out by Sen, "access to food," or more generally to food entitlements, depends on the institutional arrangements that exist in a particular society at a specific historical moment. Therefore, what first comes to mind in considering the case of Argentina is the need to analyze the food situation as an integral part of the current crisis, that is to say, in the context of the structural adjustments and agricultural model implemented in the country since the 1990s. Indeed, the fundamental causes can be sought in what in this book is termed neoliberal globalism (Otero 2004; see Chap. I, this volume): the ideology that promotes privatization processes, extreme deregulation - particularly of the labor market - and opening up to the world economy, all of which were applied even more drastically in Argentina than elsewhere. This had a significant effect on the levels of poverty and unemployment, as well as on real wages and incomes of the poorest sectors of society. In this chapter, I intend to show how the issue of access to food is closely linked not only to the neoliberal globalism introduced in Argentina but also specifically to the agricultural and agroindustrial model that was implemented and that formed part of it. This model is promoted and dominated by large transnational corporations and the technology they control: supermarkets at the distribution end of the food chain, large corporations that control the food industry, a highly concentrated financial sector, and the seed and agrochemical industries, among other sectors (see Teubal and Rodriguez 2002). I focus on the neoliberal reforms of the 1990s that, combined with aspects of the revolution in biotechnology, transformed the agrifood system and agriculture within it. I also intend to demonstrate how factors inherent in these transformations significantly affected the population's access to food. One aspect of the industrial agriculture model (Vallianatos 2001, 2003) implemented in the country was the widespread introduction of genetically modified crops, particularly genetically modified soybeans. Indeed, Argentina now produces more genetically modified produce than any other Third World country, precisely because of the boom in the production and export of genetically modified soy. In this chapter I intend to show the adverse consequences of this process on Argentina's food sovereignty. © 2008 by The University of Texas Press. All rights reserved.

N2  - The magnitude of concurrent malaria infection and the impact it has on hematological abnormalities, such as anemia in people living with HIV/AIDS, is not well studied in Ethiopian set up. In this cross sectional study, therefore, we assessed the prevalence of concurrent malaria infection and anemia among highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) naive people living with HIV/AIDS between October, 2012 to May, 2013 in Northern Ethiopia. After obtaining consent, socio demographic, clinical, immunological and behavioural data was obtained. The overall prevalence of concomitant malaria infection was 17.4%. Rural residents and low to middle income class clients were more frequently co-infected with malaria (p<0.0001). Utilization of insecticide treated nets (p=0.0002) and co-trimoxazole intake (p=0.006) were protective factors against Plasmodium infection. The overall prevalence of anemia was also high (43%), being significantly higher (91.3%) in malaria positive people living with HIV/AIDS compared to malaria free HIV patients (32.8%) (p<0.0001). Female gender (p=0.011), history of opportunistic infections (P=0.0027) and late HIV stages (III and IV) (p=0.0001) were also significantly associated with anemia in HIV patients. In conclusion, concurrent malaria represents a common condition and there was a significant difference in the odds of anemia between malaria positive and negative people living with HIV/AIDS in Northern Ethiopia indicating a need for routine screening of people living with HIV/AIDS living in malaria endemic-areas and close monitoring of co-infected patients. Indeed utilization of ITNs, malaria prophylaxis and early HIV diagnosis are highly encouraged in people living with HIV/AIDS.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria during pregnancy and childhood is one of the major public health challenges globally. Its prevalence is huge in Africa, especially in sub-Saharan countries and Ethiopia. Insecticide-treated mosquito net (ITN) use is one of the primary malaria preventive strategies. Previous studies did not adequately address the health belief and behaviour-related correlates of ITN using health belief model (HBM), although a number of studies were conducted in this theme. Therefore, this study was aimed at assessing the prevalence and associated factors of ITN utilization among pregnant women and under five children in east Belessa district, northwest Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional mixed study was conducted in east Belessa district from February 01-30/2020. A total of 724 eligible participants were included in the quantitative study. A multistage cluster sampling technique was used. The quantitative data were collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. Data were entered into Epi data version 4.6.0.2 and then exported to SPSS version 16 for analysis. The binary logistic regression model was fitted and the level of significance was declared based on AOR with its 95% CI and p-value ≤ 0.05. Meanwhile, the qualitative data were collected using focus group discussions and key informant interviews, and analysed using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: The prevalence of ITN utilization was 56.5% (95% CI 53.0, 60.2) and independently predicted by a corrugated iron roof of the house (AOR = 1.53; 95% CI 1.15, 2.22), rural residence (AOR = 1.59; 95% CI 1.11,2.28), ≥ 2 number of rooms in the house (AOR = 1.56; 95% CI 1.06, 2.30) and high level of perceived barrier (AOR = 0.53; 95% CI 0.38,0.74). In the qualitative findings, the main barrier was connected to misconceptions and misperception towards malaria and ITN. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of ITN utilization in the study area was lower than the national target (100%). It was significantly associated with household characteristics, residence, and level of a perceived barrier. Reversing the community's misconceptions through information, education and communication (IEC), and behavioural change communication (BCC) would enhance ITN utilization.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of insecticide resistant mosquitoes renewed interest in investigating the use of larvivorous fish as a biological control agent. The potential of Clarias gariepinus fish in controlling Anopheles arabiensis and culicine larvae was assessed under laboratory and semi-field conditions. RESULTS: Small size (15-20 cm) C. gariepinus fish consumed greater number of mosquito larvae than the large size fish (25-40 cm) in the multivariate regression model (β = 13.36, 95 % CI = 4.57, 22.15). The Anopheles larvae consumed was greater in number than the culicines larvae consumed by the fish (β = 12.10, 95 % CI = 3.31, 20.89). The number of larvae consumed was greater during the night hours than during the light hours (β = 30.06, 95 % CI = 21.27, 38.85). Amount of supplementary fish food did not cause significant differences in the number of mosquito larvae consumed by the fish among different groups. C. gariepinus was observed to feed on mosquito larvae under laboratory and semi-field conditions. CONCLUSION: C. gariepinus fed on the larvae of An. arabiensis and culicines readily. Hence, it can be used as an alternative mosquito control agent in Ethiopia where the breeding habitats are small and localized.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Making insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) utilization a social norm would support the global goal of malaria eradication and Ethiopian national aim of its elimination by 2030. Jimma zone is one of the endemic settings in Ethiopia. This study aimed to report effects of malaria education, delivered by students, on community behaviours; particularly ITNs. METHODS: In pre-posttest, cross-sectional household surveys conducted in rural villages of 5 districts in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia, 762 households were sampled. The intervention engaged students from primary schools in participatory peer education within small groups, followed by exposing parents with malaria messages aimed at influencing perceptions and practices. The data were analysed using SPSS version 20.0. Proportions/means differences were computed to compare changes in exposure, knowledge, perceptions, and practices using 95% CI at p < 0.05. Regression analyses were conducted to assess exposures to school-based education, content intensity, perception, and access related predictors of ITN utilization over the intervention periods. RESULTS: Over the intervention periods, the findings showed significant improvement in exposure to and content intensity of malaria messages delivered by students, effect size (ES) = 44.5% and 19.3%, p < 0.001, respectively. ITN utilization (ES = 25.8%), and the reported behaviour of giving ITN priority to children under 5 years old and pregnant women increased by ES = 16.3% and  24.8%, respectively. The exposure status or content intensity of malaria education, in turn, significantly improved comprehensive knowledge about malaria (β = +1.82), misconceptions about causes (β = - 11.46), awareness of caring for ITN (β = +24.79), identifying ITN as effective preventive methods (OR = 1.93), attitude towards ITN (β = +0.20), perceived efficacy of ITN (OR = 1.04), acceptance of ITN as a means to control the danger of malaria (β = +8.08%), and ITN utilization (OR = 1.85). Nonetheless, perceived threat (β = - 0.19) significantly negatively correlated with exposure to students' messages. Socio-demography, access, exposures to messages, and parental perception that students were good reminders predicted ITN utilization over the intervention periods with some changing patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Exposing the community to malaria education through students effectively supports behaviour change, particularly ITN usage, to be more positive towards desired malaria control practices. A school-based strategy is recommended to the national effort to combat malaria.

N2  - Tigray, the northernmost state of Ethiopia, has a population of 3.5 million, 86% rural, and 56% living in malarious areas. In 1992 a Community-Based Malaria Control Programme was established to provide region-wide and sustained access to early diagnosis and treatment of malaria at the village level. 735 volunteer community health workers (CHWs) serve 2,327 villages with a population of 1.74 million, treating an average of 489,378 patients yearly from 1994 to 1997. Recognition of clinical malaria is similar for CHWs and health staff at clinics where there is no access to microscopy. In 1996 a pilot community-financing scheme of insecticide-treated bednets was well accepted, but re-impregnation rates fell in 1998 because of war-related social upheaval. Indicators from health institutions show a progressive increase in malaria morbidity from 1994 to 1998. Repeated mortality surveys show a 40% reduction in death rates in under-5 children from 1994 to 1996 and a 10% increase from 1996 to 1998. These trends may be related to increased malaria transmission with water resources development, increased seasonal labour migration to malarious lowlands, prolongation of the transmission season with climate changes, and increasing chloroquine resistance throughout Ethiopia. Progressive extension of CHW services to ensure better coverage of women, children, migrant workers and communities near water development projects, change to first-line treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, extension of the impregnated bednet initiative, and development of a regional warning system for epidemics should result in a greater impact on morbidity and mortality.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has shown incredible success in malaria morbidity, mortality, and control. Community empowerment is a milestone to meet the ambitious plans of eliminating malaria by 2030. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate school-based malaria social behavior change communication (SBCC) in terms of community message exposure, acceptance, knowledge, and practices. METHODS: A community-based pre-posttest study was conducted in five districts of the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. 762 and 759 households were sampled for baseline and end-line, respectively. The intervention engaged students from primary schools on participatory peer education within small groups, followed by exposing parents with malaria messages aimed to influencing ideation and preventive practices. The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Proportion/mean differences were computed to compare both surveys on exposure, knowledge, perceptions, and practices at p <0.05. Finally, a regression analysis was conducted between key changes and school-based exposure. RESULTS: The study revealed a sharp increase in exposure to malaria messages with effect size (ES) of 65.7%, p <0.001. School specific exposure has grown to 57.8% (ES = 44.5%). Comprehensive knowledge about malaria increased to 39.1% (ES = 14.8%). Identifying mosquito bites as a cause of malaria was increased by ES = 20.8%. A slight reduction in risk perception (ES = 3.3%) and attitude (ES = 3.8%) and a higher rise in self-efficacy (ES = 8.5%) were observed. Community message acceptance in favor of malaria danger control was significantly improved by 10% i.e. an increase in rational decision making to uptake preventive practices. Consistently, insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) usage was improved to 63.0% (ES = 25.8%). Giving priority to use ITNs for under five years old children and pregnant women grew by 16.3% and 24.8%, respectively. Significant improvements were observed in treatment-seeking for fever (ES = 16.3%) and early treatment-seeking (ES = 15.5%). Not painting or plastering walls 6 months within spraying changed by ES = 61%. No significant change was observed in drug adherence. The school-based content intensity of exposure had effects on comprehensive knowledge, message acceptance, and ITN utilization. CONCLUSIONS: Engaging school-aged children effectively advances community exposure, perception, and behaviors. We recommend the inclusion of school-based SBCC in the national malaria control programs.

N2  - Physoderma vacia is recently identified fungi which causes faba bean gall (FBG) in Ethiopia. Although the disease is new to the country, its epidemiology and management is not well known yet. Thus, this study was initiated to select a readily available fungicide/s with high efficacy level against FBG. Field experiment was conducted for two following years at Mush and Degem using RCB-Design with three replications. ANOVA showed significant differences (P ≤ 0.05) between fungicides in disease and yield parameters. Maximum percent severity index (PSI) (47.4 and 81.27%) and area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) (1401.178 and 2367.91%)-days were observed from control, while minimum PSI (13.6 and 37.21%) and AUDPC (387.33 and 1077.17%)-days were noticed from Nativo SC 300 fungicide on both 2019 and 2020 growing seasons, respectively. Moreover, Nativo SC 300 recorded maximum grain yield (kg/ha) 3415.85 in 2019 and 2488.17 in 2020 production year. Conversely, control resulted minimum grain yield (2040.1 and 1130.1 kg/ha) in 2019 and 2020 growing seasons, respectively. However, Amistar xtra 280 SC, Rexdo and Payrazol were phyto-toxic to faba bean per factory recommendations. Spraying Nativo SC 300 fungicide to manage FBG would provide 120.13% grain yield advantage over control. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - Maize lethal necrosis (MLN) disease has emerged as a great threat of maize production in Ethiopia. Thus, field surveys were conducted to determine the spatial distribution and association of MLN disease with biophysical factors in Southern Ethiopia, during 2016 and 2017 main cropping seasons. A total of 240 maize fields were inspected across seven districts in the 2 years. Results showed that MLN disease was 100% prevalent in maize fields though the level of importance varied among districts. Arbaminch, Mihirab Arbaya, Bonkie, Derashie, Konso and Burjdi districts lowered disease severity by 1.46%, 4.13%, 11.38%, 13.40%, 9.24% and 30.82% when compared with Demba Gofa district, respectively. Also, severe weed and insect infestations were evident in the assessed farms. The association of disease severity with biophysical factors was assessed using a logistic regression model. District, NPS fertilization, cropping system, insect and weed infestation and insecticide spray frequency were significantly associated with disease severity in the multiple reduced variable model. High (>50%) disease severity had about four, three, and two times high probability of relationship with Demba Gofa, Arbaminch, and Mihirab Arbaya, Konso, Derashie and Bonkie districts, respectively. Similarly, 0 to 50 kg ha−1 NPS fertilization, sole cropping, high insect and weed infestation and none to once insecticide spray showed a high probability of association with disease severity. The results indicated that MLN disease is highly prevalent, severe and important in Southern Ethiopia. Therefore, weeding, insect vector control, NPS fertilization, intercropping, along with other agronomic practices, are recommended in the study areas and other related agro-ecologies. © 2019 The Author(s).

N2  - A two-year school-based malaria education intervention was developed to engage students as implementers in malaria prevention and control in the Oromia region, Ethiopia. The current study aimed to validate messenger students' engagement scale (MSES) in malaria education. The scale development process was done stepwise. Multiple behavioural theories were examined to derive possible domains of engagement. Next, a pool of items was developed by linking the domains with malaria target behaviours. The items critically reviewed, pretested and refined for clarity and appropriateness. A cross-sectional survey of 451 sample households with school-going children was conducted in five districts of the Jimma-Zone in March-2019. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)/principal component analysis (PCA) was executed to evaluate the construct validity of the scale. Rotated factor loading coefficients of ≥0.4 were retained. Items loaded on multiple factors were retained on the factor with a higher loading score. Cronbach's alpha of 0.7 was used as the cutoff point for reliability. Discriminative validity was declared based on Pearson correlation (between the extracted factors) coefficients that were moderate (r < 0.7), and less than the respective variance explained (VE) by each factor. The validity of convergence of domains with the overall MSES assessed (0.4 < r < 0.9). Logistic regression for key malaria preventive practices was conducted to assess predictive validity. The study explored a 24-item MSES in six domains of malaria education: reminding, supporting, monitoring, messenger credibility, role modelling and norm setting. The domains explained 67.82% variance of MSES, with a reliability of 93.3%. The factors were convergent with the overall scale (r = 0.764-0.834). Most factors were discriminative, with moderate correlation to each other. Adjusted odds ratios showed engaging credible students in reminding malaria preventive messages and modelling practices predicted exposure to message, insecticide-treated net (ITN) utilisation and cleaning surrounding. The current MSES is reliable, valid and predictive of malaria preventive practices.

N2  - BACKGROUND: PermaNet(®) 3.0 is a deltamethrin-treated combination long-lasting insecticidal net with the addition of synergist piperonylbutoxide (PBO) on its roof section. It is designed to overcome the challenge posed by pyrethroid resistant vector populations against mainstream long-lasting insecticidal nets impregnated with pyrethroids only. The objective of this study was to determine insecticide resistance status of Anopheline and Culicine mosquitoes, to evaluate the bio-efficacy of PermaNet(®) 3.0 nets and to assess household factors affecting the physical integrity of PermaNet(®) 3.0 after 3 years of use. METHODS: Insecticide susceptibility test was conducted using the WHO tube test. Bio-activity of PermaNet(®) 3.0 samples was evaluated using the WHO cone bioassay. Cross-sectional survey was conducted on 150 randomly selected households from two districts to determine household factors affecting net utilization. One hundred fifty PermaNet(®) 3.0 nets were randomly collected from the community with replacement after 3 years of deployment and physical integrity of each net was assessed. RESULTS: Both Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and Culex quinquefasciatus developed resistance against permethrin and deltamethrin. However, following pre-exposure to synergist PBO the susceptibility of mosquito population increased to both permethrin (from 39% without to 92% with PBO against An. gambiae and from 28% without to 94% with PBO against Culex quinquefasciatus) and deltamethrin (from 52% without to 99% with PBO against An. gambiae and from 43% without to 98% with PBO against Culex quinquefasciatus). Eighty percent (80%) mortality was recorded in wild population of An. gambiae s.l. exposed to unused PermaNet(®) 3.0, but its bioactivity subsequently declined as washing frequency increased from 0 to 20. The PBO coated roof section of unused PermaNet(®) 3.0 resulted in higher mosquito mortality (100%) compared to the side panels without PBO (85%). House structure, cooking and washing habits, and damage due to household pests were cited as determinants associated with bed net deterioration. Bed net proportionate hole index (pHI) was ranged from 0 to 6064. Of the 150 PermaNet(®) 3.0 nets assessed 80, 29 and 41 were considered as 'good', 'acceptable' and 'too torn', respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The bio-efficacy evaluation of PermaNet(®) 3.0 from Jimma area, southwestern Ethiopia showed moderate efficacy against pyrethroid resistant population of An. gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus. Thus, NMCPs in parallel to deployment of LLINs, should implement timely insecticide resistance management and integrated vector management strategies to slowdown the evolution and further spread of insecticide resistance. Household factors such as, housing conditions, open flame fire used for cooking and rodent attack were identified as factors contributing to the observed reduced bed net physical integrity in the study area. Universal coverage of bed nets should be accompanied with community awareness creation and training on net utilization and handling.

N2  - Uncontrolled use of pesticides could result in contamination of air, water, food, and ecosystems. This study aimed to determine pesticide residues in fruits and vegetables collected from selected farmlands of southwest Ethiopia from the end of April 2019 until mid of May 2019. The samples were extracted using a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction and clean-up method. Quantitative analysis of four organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) and seven organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were conducted using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. All the fruit and vegetable samples obtained from all sampling sites were contaminated with one or more pesticide residues. Chloroflurenol-methyl was the most predominantly detected OPPs residue in all crop samples obtained from different sampling sites, with a maximum concentration of 0.402 mg kg−1 in potato samples obtained from the Gurafarda site and a minimum value of 0.049 mg kg−1 in onion samples obtained from the South Bench site. Dibutyl chlorendate was the predominant OCPs in all samples, with the minimum value of 0.498 mg kg−1, which was detected in tomato samples collected from the Jamo site, and the maximum concentration of 1.003 mg kg−1 detected in pineapple samples obtained from the North Bench site. Dimethoate concentrations in tomato samples (0.045–0.084 mg kg−1) were above the maximum residue limits (MRLs) established by the European Union (EU) guidelines (0.01 mg kg−1) but were below the MRLs established by Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) guidelines (0.5 mg kg−1). Relatively high residue concentrations of dibutyl chlorendate and chloroflurenol-methyl were detected in all the samples obtained from all sampling sites. There is widespread use of pesticides for agriculture by the producers in the study area and there is a need for the regular monitoring of pesticide residues. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The rate of decay of the biological efficacy of insecticides used for indoor residual spraying (IRS) is an important factor when making decisions on insecticide choice for national malaria control programmes. A key roadblock to IRS programme is insecticide resistance. If resistance is detected to most of the existing insecticides used for IRS (DDT, pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamates), the logical next choice could be neonicotinoid insecticides, as pyrethroids are used to treat nets. SumiShield(™) 50WG belongs to the neonicotinoid class of insecticides and has shown promising results in several phase I, II and III trials in different settings. The aim of this study was to assess the persistence of SumiShield(™) 50WG by spraying on different wall surfaces and determine its decay rates over time in Ethiopia. METHODS: Five huts with different wall surface types (mud, dung, paint and cement) which represented the Ethiopian house wall surfaces were used to evaluate the residual efficacy of SumiShield(™) 50WG. Actellic 300CS sprayed on similar wall surfaces of another five huts was used as a comparator insecticide and two huts sprayed with water were used as a control. All huts were sprayed uniformly by an experienced spray operator; non-stop starting from the door and moving clockwise to cover the entire wall surface of the hut. The treatments were assigned to huts randomly. The residual efficacy of the insecticide formulations was evaluated against a susceptible insectary-reared population of Anopheles arabiensis using WHO cone bioassays. RESULTS: SumiShield(™) 50WG resulted in mortality rates of over 80% at 120 h post-exposure on all surface types for up to nine months post-spray, while Actellic 300CS yielded mortality rates of over 80% for eight months after spray. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial demonstrated that the residual efficacy of SumiShield(™) 50WG extends up to nine months on all treated wall surface types. The long-lasting residual efficacy and unique mode of action of the SemiShield(™) 50WG shows that it could be an ideal product to be considered as a potential candidate insecticide formulation for IRS in malaria endemic countries such as Ethiopia or other sub-Saharan countries where the transmission season lasts up to four months or longer.

N2  - Background: Congenital anomalies, also known as birth defects, are structural, functional and metabolic disorders that occur during intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally, at birth or later in life. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 270,000 deaths globally were attributable to congenital anomalies, and the aim of the study was to examine factors associated with overt congenital anomalies in Ethiopia in general and in Jimma particularly is currently inadequate. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of overt congenital anomalies and associated factors among neonates delivered at Jimma university medical center. Methods: An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1 to June 30, 2018. Data was collected from 754 delivered neonates with their respective mothers using structured and interviewer- administered questionnaire. All data were cleaned, coded and entered into EPI data 3.1 and exported to SPSS software version 20:0 for analysis. Analysis included descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression model was fitted to assess the association between the independent and dependent variables. Adjusted Odds ratios were calculated with 95 % CIs and considered significant with a p-value < 0.05. Results: A total of 754 neonates were delivered from 754 mothers. The study finding showed that the prevalence of overt congenital anomalies among live and still births neonates was 4.1 % (411 per 10,000 births). Majority of anomalies were isolated and major in 93.5 % and 96.7 % of cases respectively. Central nervous system anomalies had the highest prevalence (45.1 %) and followed by orofacial clefts (25.8 %) and musculoskeletal system defects (13 %).Unknown medication uses during early pregnancy (AOR = 15.18; 95 % CI: 5.51–40.27, p-value=<0.00), history of maternal khat chewing in early pregnancy (AOR = 3.41; 95 % CI: 1.46–7.95, p-value = 0.004), and maternal chronic illness before conception (AOR = 4.3; 95 % CI = 1.65–11.37, p-value = 0.031), were the factors associated with overt congenital anomalies. Folic acid use (AOR = 0.18; 95 % CI: 0.02–0.92, p-value = 0.003) during periconception had a protective effect from overt congenital anomaly. Conclusion: The Prevalence of overt congenital anomalies among the study participants was high. Unknown medication use, folic acid use, maternal chronic illness and history of maternal khat chewing were independent predictors of overt congenital anomalies. © 2022 The Author(s)

N2  - BACKGROUND: Indoor residual spraying is one of the key vector control interventions for malaria control in Ethiopia. As malaria transmission is seasonal in most parts of Ethiopia, a single round of spraying can usually provide effective protection against malaria, provided the insecticide remains effective over the entire malaria transmission season. This experiment was designed to evaluate the residual efficacy of bendiocarb, pirimiphos-methyl, and two doses of propoxur on four different wall surfaces (rough mud, smooth mud, dung, and paint). Filter papers affixed to wall surfaces prior to spraying were analyzed to determine the actual concentration applied. Cone bioassays using a susceptible Anopheles arabiensis strain were done monthly to determine the time for which insecticides were effective in killing mosquitoes. RESULTS: The mean insecticide dosage of bendiocarb applied to walls was 486 mg/m(2) (target 400/mg). This treatment lasted 1 month or less on rough mud, smooth mud, and dung, but 4 months on painted surfaces. Pirimiphos-methyl was applied at 1854 mg/m(2) (target 1000 mg/m(2)), and lasted between 4 and 6 months on all wall surfaces. Propoxur with a target dose of 1000 mg/m(2) was applied at 320 mg/m(2), and lasted 2 months or less on all surfaces, except painted surfaces (4 months). Propoxur with a target dose of 2000 mg/m(2), was applied at 638 mg/m(2), and lasted 3 months on rough mud, but considerably longer (5-7 months) on the other substrates. CONCLUSIONS: It would appear that the higher dose of propoxur and pirimiphos-methyl correspond best to the Ethiopian transmission season, although interactions between insecticide and the substrate should be taken into account as well. However, the insecticide quantification revealed that the dosages actually applied differed considerably from the target dosages, even though care was taken in the mixing of insecticide formulations and spraying of the walls. It is unclear whether this variability is due to initial concentrations of insecticides, poor application, or other factors. Further work is needed to ensure that target doses are correctly applied, both operationally and in insecticide evaluations.

N2  - Although the widespread use of indoors residual spraying (IRS) and insecticides treated bednets (ITNs; later replaced by long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs)) has led to a dramatic reduction of malaria burden in endemic areas, such usage has also resulted in the major challenge of the evolution of insecticide resistance in the mosquito population in those areas. Thus, efforts to combat malaria also include the urgent problem of effectively managing insecticide resistance. This study is based on the design and analysis of a new mathematical model for assessing the impact of insecticides resistance in the mosquito population (due to widespread use of IRS and ITNs) on the transmission dynamics and control of malaria in a community. The model, which couples disease epidemiology with vector population genetics, incorporates several fitness costs associated with insecticide resistance. Detailed rigorous analysis of the model is presented. Using data and parameter values relevant to malaria dynamics in moderate and high malaria transmission settings in some parts of Ethiopia, simulations of the model show that, while the ITNs-IRS strategy can lead to the effective control of the disease in both the moderate and high malaria transmission setting if the ITNs coverage level in the community is high enough (regardless of the level of IRS coverage), it fails to manage insecticide resistance (as measured in terms of the frequency of resistant allele at equilibrium in the community). It is further shown that the effective size of the coverage level of the ITNs and IRS required to effectively control the disease, while effectively managing insecticide resistance in the mosquito population, depends on the magnitude of the level of resistant allele dominance (in mosquitoes with heterozygous genotype) and several fitness costs associated with the insecticide resistance in the vector population. For instance, in a moderate transmission setting, malaria burden can be reduced to low levels of endemicity (even with low coverage of ITNs and IRS), and insecticide resistance effectively managed, if the fitness costs of resistance are at their assumed baseline values. Such reduction is not achievable if the fitness costs of resistance are lower than the baseline values.

N2  - Background: Cabbage is a subsistence crop for smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. Diamondback moths and cabbage aphids are among the devastating insects that cause yield losses of 90% and 30%. Objective: The aim was to test the efficacy of the bio-rational insecticides against diamondback moth and cabbage aphids, and their effect on cabbage yield and yield loss. Methods: A field experiment was conducted at the Gumsalasa micro dam with furrow irrigation during 2019/20 in Northern Ethiopia. Treatments were arranged in RCB design and replicated thrice. The experiment included five bio-rational insecticides; (R. obtusifolius), (P. dodecandra), (N. glauca), (T. minuta), (A. indica), Karate 5% EC (standard test), and control. Results: Phytolacca dodecandra aqueous leaf extract showed inspiring results, reducing diamondback moth larvae to 0.13 and aphid colonies to 0.16, 48 hours after the 4th spraying, leading to a higher (40.28 t ha-1) fresh cabbage yield followed by A.indica, which had reduced the invasion of diamondback moth and aphid colonies to 0.20 and 0.40 and the yield was recorded as 27.69 t ha-1 compared with 2.46 and 5.53 diamondback moth and aphid colonies, and 23.86 t ha-1 cabbage yield in the control group. Similarly, aqueous extracts of P. dodecandra showed a commendable yield (68.82%) increment over the control, and an estimated yield loss of 40.76% was recorded from the control plots due to the tested insect pests. Conclusion: This study concludes that foliar extracts of P. dodecandra can be used as an alternative management option to replace synthetic insecticides and thereby maintain food security. © 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - Sorghum is a staple crop grown in the poorest and most food-insecure regions of Ethiopia. But storage insect pests are its key constraints that have been causing considerable loss. Accordingly, an assessment of the prevalence of insect pests and the associated loss of sorghum stored under farmers’ traditional storages was done in randomly selected major sorghum-growing kebeles of Kena District using a nested design between November 1, 2019 and December 30, 2020. It was conducted through the sampling of one kg of grain from a total of 360 randomly selected farmers’ storages. Pests’ abundance was determined by dividing the total number of individual species by the total number of samples. A count and weight method was used to estimate percent grain damage and weight loss by pests. Sitophilus zeamais, Sitophilus oryzae, Sitotroga cereallella, Tribolium castaneum, Tribolium confusum, Cryptolestes ferrugineus, Cryptolestes pusillus, Rhyzopertha dominica, and Plodia interpunctella were the pests identified from grain samples. When compared to mid-latitude, where they were found in the range between 2.36± 0.21 and 17.50±0.98 mean number of species, all of these pests had a considerably (p < 0.05) larger distribution in lowland kebeles, where they predominated in the range between 5.44±2.00 and 23.61±1.75 amean number. During the nine-month storage period, the degree of pest infestation, percentage of grain damage, and weight loss were significantly (p < 0.05) higher in the bamboo bins when no management measures were implemented in the mid-land and low-land kebeles, respectively, than in the barn. Consequently, bamboo bin storage was considered ineffective for sufficient sorghum grain protection against pests and the associated loss over a longer storage period. But barn storage and the use of cultural pest management practices performed better in protecting stored sorghum from pests. Therefore, improving the bamboo bin storage method is needed to improve its grain protection efficacy. © 2024 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

N2  - The research was conducted to quantify and identify major factors of fruit loss. Questionnaires were used to collect data from 180 randomly selected fruit producers of six districts. Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis were employed for data analysis. Result revealed that fruit losses in the preharvest and postharvest were 20.7% and 22.1% of the total production respectively. Multiple regression analysis depicted means of income, use of pesticides and use of compost and manure had significantly contributed to losses in the preharvest. Regression analysis revealed experience, educational level of producers and shortage of labour had significant effect for losses during harvesting whereas chemical treatment and educational level affected losses in storage. Moreover, experience, distance from market, educational level were significant factors of fruit loss during marketing. Therefore, the study suggests adoption of scientific approach, education, skill developments and use of pre and postharvest technologies are important to minimise losses. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Anaemia is known to be one of the outcomes of parasitic infection and it may result in impaired cognitive development, reduced physical work capacity and in severe cases increased risk of mortality, particularly during the prenatal period. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of anaemia among pregnant women in Gilgel-Gibe dam area, southwestern Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional community based study was conducted on 388 pregnant women living in three districts around Gilgel Gibe Dam area, southwestern Ethiopia. Socio-demographic and socio-economic data were collected from each participant. A single stool sample was also collected from each selected pregnant woman. Haemoglobin concentration was determined by the cyanmethemoglobin method. Plasmodium infection prevalence and intensity were assessed with thin and thick blood film examination. RESULTS: Of the total 388 study participants, 209 (53.9%) were anaemic. Pregnant woman who were rural residents (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.62, 95% C.I: 1.02-2.62, P= 0.042), not using insecticide treated nets (ITNs) during the study period (AOR = 2.84, 95% C.I: 1.33-6.05, p = 0.007), those who were Plasmodium malaria infected (AOR = 11.19, 95% C.I: 3.31-37.7, p= 0.01) and those with Soil Transmitted Helminth (STH) infections (AOR=1.82, 95% C.I: 1.16-2.87, p=0.001) had higher odds of being anaemic than those who were urban residents, using ITNs, free of Plasmodium malaria and Soil transmitted helminth infection, respectively. There was a significant correlation between increasing hookworm parasite load (r = -.110, P< 0.001), Ascaris lumbricoides (r = -.122, P < 0.001) and Trichuris trichiura (r = -.025, P < 0.001) and decreasing hematocrit values. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of anaemia indicates it is currently a serious health problem of pregnant women living in Gilgel Gibe Dam area. Plasmodium malaria and soil transmitted helminth infections were significantly associated with anaemia. Antenatal care should promote de-worming and education on personal hygiene. Therefore, there is a need to design strategies that help to diagnose pregnant women for malaria and STH infections during their antenatal care (ANC) visit instead of testing for only haemoglobin (Hgb) levels and blood group.

N2  - The locust outbreaks are known to occur across different regions around the globe and have a significant impact on global food security. Large swarms of locust proved havoc to many agricultural croplands and pasturelands in a very few time-period. The swarm of locusts in the recent past represents one of the worst infestations over the past many years in many countries including Ethiopia, Somalia, India, Kenya, Pakistan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Tanzania. The locusts were striving for every little piece of green mass on the earth during swarming and thriving potential crops like cotton, wheat, maize, and vegetable to risk. Toxic insecticides proved negative as hazardous effects on human health, biodiversity, and ecosystem services are bearing some serious abnormalities. The number of chemical insecticides proved costly as millions of dollars were spent during the control program. The use of green technologies proved effective for sustainable crop pest management programs around the world as an alternative to synthetic pesticides. So, biological pest management is best suited as an alternative to synthetic insecticide using natural microorganisms like fungi potentially known as entomopathogens. In the recent past, approximately 150 isolates belong to Beauveria and Metarhizium species against desert locusts out of which 50 isolates proved lethal. Among Metarhizium, Metarhizium falvoviride was first reported as the potential bio-control agent. Till now many species including Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, and Isaria fumosorosea proved lethal, but Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum proved best and environmentally much safer to use and have no significant effects on natural bio-control agents. However, the availability of substrates at the local level, the abundance of indigenous virulent fungal isolates, and cheap labor are necessary requirements for the establishment of a successful mycotoxin-based industry. © 2024 Apple Academic Press, Inc.

N2  - Despite their significance in food security, pesticides have the potential to seriously harm both the environment and human health. It may lower the rates of egg hatching, offspring growth, vision, illness resistance, predator avoidance, and overall population survival. Nevertheless, over 75% of Ethiopian farmers lack the literacy to read pesticide labels and comprehend the consequences of pesticide residues on the environment. Pesticides are mixed and applied in close proximity to bodies of water, including sources of drinkable water. Farmers in the country overuse and misuse the pesticides without worrying about its negative effects. Ethiopia failed to adequately enforce its environmental protection laws to reduce the harmful effects of pesticide residues. The aim of this review is to summarize the trends of pesticide use, the effects of pesticide residues on aquatic ecosystems, the pesticide application practices, and the level of enforcement of pesticide laws in the country. The literature search was done using different search engines. Disagreement among policies, absence of liability for overlooking duties, negligence of the pesticide effects on human health and the environment, and a strong commitment to short-term economic growth are reasons for ineffective law enforcement. Regular supply chain inspections, management of pesticide use, and widespread awareness campaigns are crucial steps to reduce the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, living things, and humans. Establishing pesticide-free buffer zones for water bodies, replacing the contradictory sectorial policies with integrated development policy, and executing the policy objectives are also crucial steps that need to be taken. © The Author(s) 2024.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the susceptibility/resistance level of Anopheles gambiae s.l. to DDT, malathion, permethrin and deltamethrin in different parts of Ethiopia. METHODS: Field collected female An.gambiae s.l. was exposed for 1 h to discriminating dosage of 4% DDT, 5% malathion, 0.75% permethrin and 0.05% deltamethrin using WHO insecticide susceptibility test kits and procedures. Knockdown and mortality rates were recorded at 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min and 24 h post-exposure respectively. RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae s.l. was sensitive to DDT only in 2 of 16 localities where susceptibility studies were carried out in northern Ethiopia; it was resistant in 11 sites and potentially resistant in three. To malathion, the test population was sensitive in four of the six study sites in southern Ethiopia and potentially resistant in the other two sites. In northern Ethiopia, the population was resistant in five localities and sensitive in three. Of the six localities in northern Ethiopia where permethrin was tested, populations were sensitive in three, resistant in one and potentially resistant in two. In southern Ethiopia, the populations were resistant in five of the six sites. Against deltamethrin, the population was sensitive in five of 13 localities, three in northern and two in southern Ethiopia. It was resistant only in two localities, one in northern and one in southern Ethiopia, and potentially resistant in five localities. In eastern Ethiopia at Sabure, the population was sensitive to all insecticides but DDT to which it was potentially resistant. CONCLUSION: The existence of high level of DDT and pyrethroid resistance with the possibility of cross-resistance to each other and other classes of agricultural pesticides could seriously jeopardise the efficacy of both ITNs and IRS in the country in the future. Insecticide resistance monitoring and surveillance systems as part of a malaria control programme are mandatory for proper management of resistance. The use of a mixture of unrelated insecticides for impregnating nets and rotational use of insecticides for IRS is suggested as a way forward.

N2  - Long-lasting insecticide nets are often used as a physical barrier to prevent infection of malaria. In sub-Saharan Africa, one of the most important ways of lowering the malaria burden is the utilization of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets. However, there is no sufficient information on long-lasting insecticide utilization in Ethiopia. Therefore, the study was aimed to assess long-lasting insecticide net utilization and associated factors among households of West Arsi Zone, Oromia, Southern Ethiopia, 2023. A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted in West Arsi Zone with a sample of 2808 households from May 01 to 30, 2023. Data were collected from households by using interviewer-administered structured questionnaires. Data were checked, coded, and entered into Epinfo version 7, cleaned, and analyzed by SPSS version 25. Descriptive analysis was used to present frequencies, proportions, and graphs. Binary logistic regression analysis was computed and the variables with p-values less than 0.25 were selected to be included in the multivariable model. The final model was interpreted using an adjusted odd ratio with a 95% confidence interval and p-value < 0.05 to declare the statistical association between the outcome and independent variables. About 2389 (86.2%) of households have long-lasting insecticide nets that can be used while sleeping. But the overall prevalence of long-lasting insecticide nets utilization was 69.9% with (95% CI 68.1-71.8). Being female as household head (AOR 1.69, 95% CI 1.33-4.15), number of separate rooms in the living house (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.23-2.29), duration of long-lasting insecticide nets used to be replaced (AOR 2.81, 95% CI 2.18-5.35), knowledge status of the respondents (AOR 3.68; 95% CI 2.48-6.97) were significantly associated with long-lasting insecticide nets utilization. The overall Household's level of LLINs utilization was found to be low as compared to the national standard of Ethiopia, which is to be ≥ 85. The study identified that being female as household head, the number of separate rooms in the living house, the duration of long-lasting insecticide nets used to be replaced, knowledge status of the respondents were the predictors of long-lasting insecticide nets utilization among members of households. Thus, to improve the usage of LLINs, the West Arsi Zone Health Office and stakeholders should strengthen the long-term insecticide net utilization at the household level by educating the community with appropriate information.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in developing countries including Ethiopia. Mass distribution of insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spray for high malaria risk groups are the major prevention measures in different countries. Achievement of the malaria elimination plan is highly determined by the level of effective utilization of intervention measures. However, there is scarce information showing the national level of insecticide-treated nets utilization. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the pooled prevalence of insecticide-treated nets utilization in Ethiopia, 2023. METHOD: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis employed to assess the utilization of long-lasting insecticidal nets in Ethiopia. Published articles were searched from Google Scholar, PubMed, Web Sciences, CINAHIL, EMBASE, and Scopus. The collected articles were screened for data extraction and further analysis using preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) flow chart. The quality of each study was assessed using the Jonna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. The data were extracted using Microsoft Excel and exported to STATA version 17.0 for analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of long-lasting insecticidal nets utilization was determined using a random effects model. RESULT: Out of 1657 articles reviewed, only 21 of them were eligible for final analysis. All of the included studies were used to estimate the pooled prevalence of long-lasting insecticidal net utilization. The point prevalence of LLIN utilization ranged from 14.23 to 91.9%. The Meta-analysis estimated that the overall pooled prevalence of insecticidal nets utilization among all study participants in Ethiopia was 56.26% (95%CI: 44.04-68.48%). Subgroup analysis revealed that insecticidal nets utilization was relatively highest in the Amhara region [63.0, 95%CI (37.0-89.0%)] and during 2020-2023 [61, 95% CI (53.0-69.0%)]. CONCLUSION: Long-lasting insecticidal nets utilization in Ethiopia is lower than the national target plan. Hence, it needs extra follow-up and intervention to enhance its utilization.

N2  - In this study, heavy metals pollution in edible vegetables was investigated from farms near Arba Minch south of Ethiopia. The most important heavy metals in vegetables are Cadmium (Cd), Copper (Cu), Lead (Pb) and Zinc (Zn). In this region, the concentrations of heavy metals in edible vegetables were evaluated. After sample preparation, concentrations of heavy metals in vegetables were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS). Four different edible vegetables from Arba Minch town i.e., Cabbage, Carrot, Potato, Tomato were sampled. The experimental results in the vegetables particularly the concentrations of Cd, Pb were above the permissible limit of heavy metals as compared to WHO guidelines. The highest and lowest values were as follows: Cd (0.032± 0.0005-0.088± 0.0008) ppm, Cu(1.240± 0.0122–2.480± 0.0959) ppm, Pb (0.235± 0.0025– 0.927± 0.0042) ppm, and Zn (1.541± 0.0029–4.430± 0.0031)ppm.In consequence, the results of this study indicate that could attribute to metals contamination to take place during pre-harvest and post-harvest process. Possible sources during pre-harvest include from soil type, fertilizers, pesticides, municipal wastewater and water used for irrigation, while post-harvest sources may include contamination through air pollution and during transport to the market or at the point of sale industrial waste water can cause pollution in well waters and edible vegetables. So, this region is not suitable for cultivation and growing vegetables. © The Author(s) 2019.

N2  - Floriculture is a new and rapidly expanding sector in Ethiopia that aids economic growth but has also come under blame for pollution of the surrounding soil. The purpose of this study was to assess the soil physicochemical properties and heavy metal contents in floriculture in the Amhara Region of Northwest Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from seven different greenhouses (2ABC, 4DEF, 5ABC, 7DEF, 8ABC, 9DEF, and 11DEF), and a control soil sample was taken on the 15-cm depth from a nearby agricultural area. They were analyzed for soil physicochemical parameters and heavy metal compositions. Soil texture showed a significant difference between the soils sampled from the greenhouses and the control group. The highest average clay, silt, and sand contents were recorded in the control group, 4DEF, and 9DEF, respectively. The lower clay content was at 9 DEF, silt at 11 DEF, and sand in the control group. Clay was positively correlated to soil pH (r = 0.66) and TN (r = 0.38) but showed significant negative correlation with the sand fraction (r = -0.96). The average bulk density (BD) values of the soils from the greenhouses were within acceptable ranges; however, the mean BD value of 7DEF was relatively highest (1.34 g/cm(3)). There were significant (P < 0.05) changes in soil pH and electrical conductivity, with pH values ranging from 5.8 to 7.17 and EC from 0.08 to 1.72 mScm(-1). Soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, total nitrogen, and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of the soil samples from the greenhouses and the control group were significantly different. There were also significant differences in soil exchangeable aluminum and acidity between greenhouse soil samples and the control group. Soil contents of some of the heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Mn, and Cu) in the floriculture soil were above the permissible limits, while Cr, Zn, and Ni contents were below. The soil in floriculture showed low quality compared to the control group and international standards, indicating the need for improved soil quality management. This study recommends reducing agrochemical use, increasing bio-fertilizers, using botanicals, and transitioning to organic farming. Further studies are needed to assess soil microbial diversity and abundance for soil fixation.

N2  - This study provides local perspectives on water use and conservation of Lake Ziway and its watershed in Ethiopia. Past and present water use, management and conservation efforts are investigated, and causes to the lake’s current degradation are presented. The study is based on empirical data gathered through face-to-face interviews with experts from federal, regional and district state offices, research center, and local economy and conservation groups. The results show that the water quality and water level of Lake Ziway have been decreasing due to anthropogenic factors. The main causes are attributed to uncontrolled water abstraction from the lake, discharge reduction from feeder rivers, siltation due to deforestation-induced soil erosion in the watershed, and effluent discharges from floriculture industries as well as agrochemical runoff. Water use and discharge influx is not regulated or planned. A good number of interviewees perceived that the state’s effort to address the problems of Lake Ziway and its watershed is weak. This study contributes to the understanding of the local socio-ecological coherences and environmental problems Lake Ziway and its watershed are facing. It also provides firsthand information that can contribute to the development of long-term sustainable water use and conservation strategies for the lake and its watershed, which could also be applied to other lakes in Ethiopia, and beyond. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

N2  - Agriculture is the most significant contributor to Ethiopia's national economy. The Government of Ethiopia uses agriculture-led industrial development to spearhead the country's development program. Irrigation development is seen as one of the major contributors to the development process. It is, therefore, essential to study the performance of existing irrigation systems in order to become informed about this development process. We used the stochastic frontier production function approach to estimate the production frontiers and technical inefficiency of four different production systems; namely rain-fed production for purely rain-fed farmers (n = 351), rain-fed production for farmers with access to irrigation (n = 434), traditional (n = 122) and modern (n = 281) irrigation systems. The data used for the estimations were collected from random samples of farmers from each of the systems for the 2005/2006 production season. The results showed that the traditional irrigation farmers are producing on a lower production frontier than the modern irrigation scheme farmers. It was also seen that the traditional scheme farmers have lower technical inefficiencies than the modern scheme farmers. The stochastic frontier production function shows that the production frontier for the rain-fed system of farmers with access to irrigation is higher than that of rain-fed farmers without access to irrigation. We hypothesize that there may be some resource transfers by using the cash generated from irrigated farms to intensify rain-fed production through the acquisition of fertilizer, herbicides and other inputs. The gains from such a shift in intensification may be more cost-effective than the gains that may accrue from irrigation since such a shift most likely will not involve the initial capital outlay as is usually required by irrigation and since such gains have the capacity to affect many of the rain-fed farmers. The only disadvantage is that this approach does not 'de-link' the performance of the economy from rainfall variability. We explored some socioeconomic factors that are associated with technical inefficiency for the different systems. We found that the age of the household head was significantly associated with the level of technical inefficiency in the purely rain-fed and modern irrigation systems. We also found that gender and extension were significantly associated with the levels of technical inefficiency. The analysis of constraints showed that soil fertility, weed control, pest and diseases control, soil erosion, input access and moisture deficiency are significantly associated with levels of technical inefficiency for rain-fed farmers. This analysis showed that identifying the socioeconomic variables that impact technical inefficiency, (e.g., extension) and alleviating the constraints associated with them can improve rain-fed production. This result is consistent with the conclusion from the stochastic frontier production function analysis. Based on these findings, we conclude that the Government of Ethiopia should take a twopronged approach, i.e., developing irrigation while not ignoring the potential gains to be made from improving rain-fed production. We computed the gross margins for the different systems. We observed that the higher frontier for the rain-fed farmers with access to irrigation did not result in higher gross margins when compared to the lower production frontier for the purely rain-fed farmers, since the statistics of the average gross margins were not significantly different between the two samples. We also observed that the same applied to the irrigation systems, because the higher frontier for the modern irrigation systems did not also translate into higher gross margins than the lower frontier for the traditional irrigation farmers. We conclude that it is important to investigate what constraints cause the higher frontiers not to translate into higher gross margins. The results suggest that the farmers on the higher frontier may be making poor allocative decisions and thus achieving the s me gross margins as farmers on a lower frontier. Identifying and addressing such constraints can lead to more viable rain-fed and irrigated production. Finally, we note that most of the findings from this paper suggest that irrigation could be used as a viable development strategy. However, the results in this paper are based on one year's data. In order to improve the robustness of the results it is important to collect exactly the same data from exactly the same sample for two or three seasons. © 2012, by IWMI.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains a major public health problem in Ethiopia. Pyrethroid-treated mosquito nets are one of the major tools available for the prevention and control of malaria transmission. PermaNet is a long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLIN) recommended by WHO for malaria control. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess utilization and retention of PermaNet nets distributed for malaria control in Buie and Fentalie districts and monitor the bio-efficacy of the nets using the WHO cone bioassay test procedures. METHODS: A cross sectional study was carried out by interviewing household heads or their representative in Buie and Fentalie districts. The two districts were selected based on a priori knowledge of variations on ethnic background and housing construction. Clusters of houses were chosen within each of the study villages for selection of households. 20 households that had received one or more PermaNet nets were chosen randomly from the clusters in each village. A total of eight used PermaNet nets were collected for the bio-efficacy test. The bio-efficacy of PermaNet nets was monitored according to the standard WHO procedures using a susceptible colony of Anopheles arabiensis to deltamethrin. RESULTS: A total of 119 household heads were interviewed during the study. The retention rate of nets that were distributed in 2005 and 2006 season was 72%. A total of 62.2% of the interviewees claimed children under five years of age slept under LLIN, while only 50.7% of the nets were observed to be hanged inside houses when used as a proxy indicator of usage of LLIN. For the bio-efficacy test the mean knock-down was 94% and 100%, while the mean mortality rate observed after 24 hr holding period was 72.2% and 67% for Buie and Fentalie districts respectively. CONCLUSION: The study revealed a moderately high retention of PermaNet in the study villages and effectiveness of the nets when tested according to the standard WHO procedure.

N2  - Heavy metal contamination of food crops is an issue of global concern that ultimately results in toxicity and diseases in humans and animals through consumption of contaminated soils and food crops. With a population of 182 million people, Nigeria is regarded as the most populous country in Africa. The people suffer environmental pollution from high levels of heavy metal accumulation in the environment and in food crops. Heavy metals have atomic densities higher than 4 g/cm3, and these include lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), silver (Ag), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and platinum (Pt). The high level of environmental contamination by these metals is dangerous because their uptake by plants and subsequent accumulation in food crops consumed by humans and animals is deleterious to health. There are many known sources of harmful metals, including the earth, which releases them into food, air, and water, and anthropogenic activities, such as the application of fertilizer in agriculture, the use of pesticides and herbicides, and irrigation. Other sources are automobile emissions, paints, cigarette smoking, industries, and sewage and waste disposal. Evidence shows that vegetables and other food crops consumed in Nigeria are contaminated by heavy metals, and this is associated with adverse health issues, such as cancer, which is currently on the rise in Nigeria. It is therefore vital that communities with high levels of heavy metal pollution avoid eating large quantities of these food items. There is also the need for the monitoring of levels of these injurious elements in food crops. © 2018 The Author(s).

N2  - Sesame seeds, being a crucial traditional oilseed crop in Ethiopia, face challenges related to storage and insect pests that can adversely affect their quality and quantity. Farmers often sell their sesame seeds immediately after harvest at lower prices due to concerns about pest damage during storage. This study aimed to assess the impact of different storage containers and storage durations on reducing infestation by storage insect pests and minimizing losses of stored sesame seeds over a six-month period. The findings revealed that hermetic storage solutions, particularly PICS and SGP bags, effectively suppressed insect development, minimized losses, and maintained seed viability without the need for insecticides. Weight loss in PICS and SGP bags remained consistent regardless of the storage duration, whereas jute and PP bags exhibited a significant increase in weight loss. Lower seed germination rates were observed in PP and jute bags, whereas PICS and SGP bags maintained consistent germination rates throughout the storage period. PICS and SGP bags also exhibited a significant decrease in oxygen levels and an increase in carbon dioxide levels, contributing to the reduction in insect infestation. In comparison, traditional storage bags such as jute and PP bags exhibited higher insect counts, seed damage, and greater weight loss compared to hermetic bags. Therefore, hermetic storage solutions are recommended for farmers to minimize losses and preserve seed viability. During the study, three insect species were identified as the most prevalent in stored sesame seeds: Corcyra cephalonica, Tribolium spp (T. castaneum & T. confusum), and Rhyzopetha dominica. The maximum insect counts of these species were recorded in jute bags. At the beginning of the experiment, the average seed damage across all storage units was 1.9%, which increased to 14.1% in jute bags and 9.3% in PP bags after six months of storage. © 2023

N2  - This study examined the use of crop health advices that farmers received at village-based plant clinics and their determinants in Ethiopia. Data were collected from 210 randomly selected plant clinic users from three districts of Ethiopia, and analysed using descriptive statistics and a binary logistic regression model. Plant clinic users were smallholders with an average landholding of 0.8ha, predominantly male, with a mean age of 46years. Most recommendations for pest management were a combination of monitoring, cultural practices and pesticides, in line with Integrated Pest Management (IPM) principles. About 64% and 34% of the clinic users fully or partially, respectively, applied the recommendations. After visiting plant clinics, farmers demonstrated improved knowledge and practices in using pesticides, although no significant difference was observed between the types of pesticides they used. Stability of plant doctors, distance to plant clinics, and education significantly and positively influenced the use of plant clinic advice, whereas age was negatively associated. The findings suggest that plant clinics provide relevant and practical advice that address plant health problems of farmers. Thus, such project-based intervention should be fully integrated into regular programmes to ensure their sustainability. © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is the most important winter season food legume in Ethiopia. Despite being a major producer and consumer of chickpeas, Ethiopia experiences lower yields due to biotic and abiotic stresses, particularly insect pest infestations during storage. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of different storage technologies and durations on the losses of stored chickpea seeds in terms of both quantity and quality. The experiment involved five storage technologies and three durations, spanning a period of 6 months, with data collected at 2-month intervals. The results showed that the Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) and Super GrainPro (SGP) bags effectively maintained intergranular temperature, seed moisture content, and relative humidity throughout the storage period, followed by the modified hermetic metal silo. In contrast, traditional bags exhibited a significant increase in these parameters. The PICS and SGP bags also exhibited the lowest numbers of total insect pests after 6 months, while the jute bags had the highest infestation. Common insect species found in the stored chickpea seeds were Callosobruchus chinensis (L.), Sitophilus oryzae (L.), and Tribolium confusum (duVal). Furthermore, hermetic bags (PICS and SGP) demonstrated the least grain damage and weight loss, while jute bags had relatively higher values. Seed viability was well maintained in hermetic bags but significantly decreased in traditional bags. Overall, hermetic storage technologies, such as the PICS and SGP bags, effectively suppressed insect development, reduced losses, and preserved seed viability without the need for insecticides. It is recommended that farmers use these hermetic storage bags after proper drying to enhance food security and income generation. By implementing these recommendations, Ethiopia can enhance its chickpea storage practices, reduce post-harvest losses, and contribute to improved food security and economic sustainability in the chickpea sector. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of insecticide resistance in the major African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae (s.s.) and An. arabiensis may compromise the current vector control interventions and threatens the global malaria control and elimination efforts. METHODS: Insecticide resistance was monitored in several study sites in Ethiopia from 2013 to 2015 using papers impregnated with discriminating concentrations of DDT, deltamethrin, bendiocarb, propoxur, malathion, fenitrothion and pirimiphos-methyl, following the WHO insecticide susceptibility test procedure. Mosquitoes sampled from different localities for WHO bioassay were morphologically identified as An. gambiae (s.l.) using standard taxonomic keys. Samples were identified to species using species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and screened for the presence of target site mutations L1014F, L1014S and N1575Y in the voltage gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene and G119S in the acethylcholinesterase (AChE) gene using allele-specific PCR. Biochemical assays were performed to assess elevated levels of acetylcholinesterases, carboxylcholinesterases, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P450s monooxygenases in wild populations of An. arabiensis, compared to the fully susceptible Sekoru An. arabiensis laboratory strain. RESULTS: Populations of An. arabiensis were resistant to DDT and deltamethrin but were susceptible to fenitrothion in all the study sites. Reduced susceptibility to malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, propoxur and bendiocarb was observed in some of the study sites. Knockdown resistance (kdr L1014F) was detected in all mosquito populations with allele frequency ranging from 42 to 91%. Elevated levels of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) were detected in some of the mosquito populations. However, no elevated levels of monooxygenases and esterases were detected in any of the populations assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Anopheles arabiensis populations from all surveyed sites in Ethiopia exhibited resistance against DDT and pyrethroids. Moreover, some mosquito populations exhibited resistance to propoxur and possible resistance to bendiocarb. Target site mutation kdr L1014F was detected in all mosquito populations while elevated levels of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) was detected in some mosquito populations. The reduced susceptibility of An. arabiensis to propoxur and bendiocarb, which are currently used for indoor residual spraying (IRS) in Ethiopia, calls for continuous resistance monitoring, in order to plan and implement evidence based insecticide resistance management.

N2  - Malaria is one of the major public health problems in sub-Saharan Africa, including Ethiopia. Children under the age of five are immunologically naive to plasmodium parasites, making them the most vulnerable group to clinical manifestations of malaria infection. Despite the severity of the disease in children under five years of age, most studies on malaria focus on the adult population. In the present study, a cross-sectional study design based on health facilities was used during the minor malaria season from February 18 to May 28, 2023, at Mohammed Akile Memorial General Hospital, in Afar Regional State, district of Amibara located in the town of Berta. The finding revealed that 19.8% prevalence among symptomatic children with 61.04% and 38.96% of P. falciparum and P. vivax, respectively. In the present study area, malaria infection in children under five years of age is significantly associated with the presence of stagnant water in the residential area, inappropriate or no use of insecticide-treated net, and indoor residual spraying (IRS). The prevalence of malaria among symptomatic children under five years of age is higher compared to the national prevalence of malaria among the general population. Therefore, community mobilization through health promotion, aiming to interrupt the transmission of malaria at the community level, is paramount.

N2  - BACKGROUND: In Ethiopia, despite the increasing availability of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs), the LLINs use among LLINs owning households has not been satisfactory. Identifying the circumstances and the associated factors is necessary to achieve the Millennium Development Goal targets. We aimed to assess barriers related with LLIN use at the household level. METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted in Kersa Demographic Surveillance and Health Research Center (KDS-HRC) from October to November 2010. A total of 2867 households were selected from a surveillance database using a simple random sampling technique. The data were collected by interviewing women, direct observation of LLINs conditions and use, and in-depth interviewing of key informants. Multivariate analysis was used to determine independent predictors of LLIN non-use. RESULTS: Of the total surveyed households, 65.5% (1879) had at least one LLIN, but 33.5% (630) LLINs owned households had used at least one LLIN the night before the survey. Low educational level of women, low awareness on malaria prevention, unavailability of separate sleeping room, LLIN colour preference, and unavailability of enough LLINs to the household members were the main barriers to LLIN use. A supplementary qualitative interview with key informants also identified that poor condition of LLINs; undermining the extent of malaria; and using the LLIN for other purposes as the main reasons for non-use. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that only about one third of LLIN owned households are actually using at least one LLIN for protection against mosquito bite. Thus, majority of the residents are at higher risk of mosquito bite and acquiring of malaria infection. Households living in fringe zone are not benefiting from the LLIN protection. Further progress in malaria prevention can be achieved by specifically targeting populations in fringe zones and conducting focused public education to increase LLIN use.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria, transmitted by the bite of infective female Anopheles mosquitoes, remains a global public health problem. The presence of invasive Anopheles stephensi, capable of transmitting Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, was first reported in Ethiopia in 2016. The ecology of this mosquito species differs from that of Anopheles arabiensis, the primary malaria vector in Ethiopia. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of selected insecticides, which are used in indoor residual spraying (IRS) and selected long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) for malaria vector control against adult An. stephensi. METHODS: Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes were collected as larvae and pupae from Awash Subah Kilo Town and Haro Adi village, Ethiopia. Adult female An. stephensi, reared from larvae and pupae collected from the field, aged 3-5 days were exposed to impregnated papers of IRS insecticides (propoxur 0.1%, bendiocarb 0.1%, pirimiphos-methyl 0.25%), and insecticides used in LLINs (alpha-cypermethrin 0.05%, deltamethrin 0.05% and permethrin 0.75%), using diagnostic doses and WHO test tubes in a bio-secure insectary at Aklilu Lemma Institute of Pathobiology, Addis Ababa University. For each test and control tube, batches of 25 female An. stephensi were used to test each insecticide used in IRS. Additionally, cone bioassay tests were conducted to expose An. stephensi from the reared population to four brands of LLINs, MAGNet™ (alpha-cypermethrin), PermaNet(®) 2.0 (deltamethrin), DuraNet(©) (alpha-cypermethrin) and SafeNet(®) (alpha-cypermethrin). A batch of ten sugar-fed female mosquitoes aged 2-5 days was exposed to samples taken from five positions/sides of a net. The data from all replicates were pooled and descriptive statistics were used to describe features of the data. RESULTS: All An. stephensi collected from Awash Subah Kilo Town and Haro Adi village (around Metehara) were resistant to all tested insecticides used in both IRS and LLINs. Of the tested LLINs, only MAGNet™ (alpha-cypermethrin active ingredient) caused 100% knockdown and mortality to An. stephensi at 60 min and 24 h post exposure, while all other net brands caused mortality below the WHO cut-off points (< 90%). All these nets, except SafeNet(®), were collected during LLIN distribution for community members through the National Malaria Programme, in December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Anopheles stephensi is resistant to all tested insecticides used in IRS and in the tested LLIN brands did not cause mosquito mortality as expected, except MAGNet. This suggests that control of this invasive vector using existing adult malaria vector control methods will likely be inadequate and that alternative strategies may be necessary.

N2  - Background: Termites are a major insect pest affecting agricultural production and woody materials. They cause severe devastation in the ecosystem, and lead to bare soil. This phenomenon causes the soil to become difficult to plow, which in turn leads to a reduction in the productivity of crops. It can cause 100 % yield losses based on crop types, level of the damage, and size of its populations. To manage this pest, different management options have been evaluated in Ethiopia. While insecticide usage is the dominant option, less attention has been given to Entomopathogenic Nematode (EPN) based management options. Therefore, this research was initiated to screen locally collected EPN isolates and evaluate promising isolates under field conditions on maize crop. Methods: 37 EPN isolates were screened under laboratory condition, while two isolates were evaluated at field condition. The screening of EPN isolates was laid out in a completely randomized design, and the field evaluation used a completely randomized block design, and treatments were replicated thrice. Mortality of insect, damaged root, stem, cob, damage severity, foraging termites, and yield of the crop data were collected. Results: The study indicated that all screened EPN isolates caused mortality on termites under laboratory conditions. The isolates achieved complete mortality of the insect pest within 12 days of exposure. The finding indicated that AEH and S#50 were the more pathogenic and virulent isolates on termites under laboratory conditions and taken to field study. The S#50 isolate was most pathogenic and reduced the infestation and severity of the insect pest on the maize crop under field conditions. Conclusions: This result showed that the entomopathogenic nematode isolates have the potential to manage subterranean termites in the maize field. Future studies should be based on collection of local isolates and develop a full package for the virulent isolates. Copyright: © 2024 Abate Gutema B et al.

N2  - This chapter examines the outcomes of weed management research and development in Ethiopia and identifies future priority areas. So far, nearly 1100 weed species representing 552 genera and 126 plant families have been registered. Weeds in this country can cause a minimum of ~15% to a total crop failure. The research system has accomplished several milestones, including evaluation of new herbicides and development of herbicide recom¬mendations, non-chemical methods (including weed biology and dynamics in crops and cropping systems), management of regular, parasitic and invasive species, and transfer of management technologies. There have also been successes in the biological control of the whitetop weed (Parthenium hysterophorus) and integrated management of the witchweed (Striga hermonthica) on sorghum, and management of herbicide-resistant annual and perennial grasses. Future emphasis will include risk analysis, invasive alien and parasitic weeds, biocontrol, herbicide resistance, herbicide-tolerant crops, herbicide residue and environmental safety. © CAB International 2024.

N2  - Background: Kafta Humera lowlands are endemic for kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis). These lowlands are characterized by black clay soil which is used for growing sesame, sorghum and cotton for commercial purposes.The aim of this study was to determine seasonal dynamics and habitat preferences of Phlebotomus orientalis, the vector of kala-azar, in extra-domestic habitats of Kafta Humera lowlands. Methods. CDC-light Trap [CDC-LT] and Sticky paper Trap [ST] were used to collect sand flies from different habitats before species identification by their morphological characteristics using appropriate keys. Data summarized and analyzed included: species, sex, density, habitats, type of trap used and date (month). Results: A total of 389,207 sand flies using CDC-LT (n = 955) and ST (n = 5551) were collected from May 17, 2011 to June 6, 2012. The highest Mean Monthly Density (MMD) of P. orientalis trapped by CDC-LT was found in thickets of Acacia seyal in March (64.11 ± 75.87). The corresponding highest MMD of P. orientalis trapped by STs was found in April (58.69 ± 85.20) in agricultural field. No P. orientalis were caught in September using CDC traps and July-October using sticky traps. The overall MMD of P. orientalis trapped by CDC-LT was 15. 78 ± 28.93 (n = 320) in agricultural field, 19.37 ± 36.42 (n = 255) in thickets of A. seyal, and 3.81 ± 6.45 (n = 380) in dense mixed forest. Similar habitats in different localities did not show statistically significant difference for the MMD of P. orientalis trapped by CDC-LT (p = 0.117) and ST (p = 0.134). Conclusion: Agricultural fields and thickets of A. seyal habitats, which exhibit extensive soil cracks and fissures, as opposed to dense mixed forests, serve as preferred breeding sites for P. orientalis. © 2014 Lemma et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - In the 21st century, the practice of agriculture is becoming more interesting, valuable, and attractive by integrating many technologies and systems. Among the different technologies and systems Crop Simulation Models (APSIM, DSSAT, and AquaCrop) are widely used to predict crop yield, forecast climate change impacts, and optimize different management practices including pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Many researchers used these computerized representations of crops worldwide and in Ethiopia for the aforementioned purposes. These crop models were used in Ethiopia by different researchers for yield prediction. Climate change impacts assessment, and the most crucial factor that policymakers and agricultural production system planners should consider when making decisions is the ability of crop simulation models, such as the agricultural production system simulator (APSIM), to save time and resources while improving prediction accuracy. Because most models are poorly or never evaluated, it is unknown if they are useful in the decision-making process. Thus, to simulate the growth, development, yield, and climate change impacts of the chosen crops in Ethiopia, this research reviews the status, application, accuracy of result prediction, challenges, and research opportunities of the APSIM crop simulation model in Ethiopia's agroecological environment. © 2024 The Authors

N2  - BACKGROUND: Under-five year children are the most vulnerable group affected by malaria, they accounted for 61% of all malaria deaths worldwide. Sherkole refugee camp is stratified under high risk for malaria. Knowledge on malaria prevalence and associated factors among under-five children in Sherkole refugee camp is lacking. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Institution-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among under-five children in Sherkole refugee camp from October to November 2019. Total sample size was 356. Stratified random sampling technique was employed to select the study participants. Standardized questionnaire was used to collect data. Care StartTM Malaria Rapid diagnostic test which detect histidine-rich protein 2 of P. falciparum and plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase of P. vivax was used to diagnose malaria. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with malaria. RESULTS: A total of 356 participants were included in this study with response rate of 97.5%. The prevalence malaria was 3.9% (95% CI = 2.0-6.2). Outdoor stay at night (AOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.14-13.8), stagnant water near to house (AOR = 4.0, 95% CI = 1.14-14.6), and the number of under-five children per household (AOR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.03-13.0) were found to increase the odds of getting malaria. Whereas, insecticide treated net (ITN)utilization (AOR = 0.22, 95% CI = 0.06-0.61) and Health information about malaria (AOR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.06-0.65) reduce the odds of getting malaria. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Malaria remains the major public health problem in Sherkole Refugee camp. Outdoor stay at night, stagnant water near to house, and number of under-five children per household were the risk factors for malaria. Health information dissemination that focuses on avoiding outdoor stay at night, eliminating stagnant water & using ITN, and considering number of under-five children per household during ITN distribution should be take into account.

N2  - Musca sorbens is a synanthropic filth fly that aggressively attacks people to feed from mucous membranes of the eyes, nose or mouth, from open sores, or from sweat. It has long been suspected that this fly contributes to the transmission of eye infections, particularly trachoma, and recent work has added to the evidence base that M. sorbens is a trachoma vector in Ethiopia. There are few options to control M. sorbens, largely due to a lack of evidence. Space spraying with insecticides is effective, but an environmentally sound and long-term sustainable solution would be better, for example, mass trapping. We tested commercially available and homemade trap types in a pilot (laboratory) study and three field studies. A homemade design, built from a bucket and two empty water bottles, baited with a commercially available lure, The Buzz, was found to be most effective. This trap caught 3848 M. sorbens over 26 trap ‘events’ (3- or 4-day periods); mean/median per 24 h 43.6 (standard deviation 137.10)/2.25 (IQR 0.25–12.67). The Buzz lure is cheap and effective for 4 weeks, and trap components cheap and locally available. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of this trap on local fly populations and the local transmission of trachoma. © 2021, The Author(s).

N2  - Bahir Dar city has suitable agro-ecologies for production of different types of fruits and vegetables, but unfortunately the area allotted for these crops, and their production and productivity are very low. There is a dearth of research and documentation on household gardens in the town. The present study attempted to assess the home garden species diversity, composition, challenges and to keep the documentation about home gardening as special references for horticultural crops in Bahir Dar city. The research was carried out in seven selected sub-cities of Bahir Dar between September and June 2020. Semi-structured questioners and interviews, as well as home garden visits, were used to collect data. 302 families were chosen based on the availability of kitchen gardening space and where kitchen gardening is already done. According to the findings of this study, home gardens in Bahir Dar city had a high species diversity and a diverse composition (especially horticultural crops) such as mango, avocado, papaya, head cabbage, tomato, and lettuce. Furthermore, as a source of additional food, home gardens significantly benefit both the gardener and society as well as income, and environmental improvement of the community. However, insufficient agricultural support encourages the use of pesticides, and small garden sizes reduce diversity of species and production. If interested organizations and scholars give these issues some thought, the hotspot will continue to sustainably support home gardening and its current biodiversity in the future. © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - Background Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common neglected tropical disease, causing stigmatised skin lesions. It is an important public health concern, with 95% of cases occurring in low-income and middle-income countries. Despite its long-recognized endemicity and psychosocial impacts, it is largely overlooked. Objective The main aim of this study is to investigate the magnitude and associated factors of CL in north-central Ethiopia. Design An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted. Setting The study was conducted in Nefas Mewcha Primary Hospital (NMPH), north-central Ethiopia. Participants The study was conducted among 332 individuals visiting NMPH from June to July 2022. Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcome was to estimate the burden of CL among patients visiting NMPH, and the secondary outcome was to identify factors associated with the presence or absence of CL. The association between predictor variables and CL was assessed using a binary logistic regression model. Statistical significance was declared at a p _value of <0.05. Result Out of the 332 study participants, 63 patients sought medical care with skin lesions, and 61 (18.37%, 95% CI: 14.5% to 22.9%) were patients with CL. Localized CL was the predominant type (86.9%). Male sex (adjusted OR (AOR): 4.51; 95% CI 1.94 to 10.45), older age (AOR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.94), secondary and tertiary educational status (AOR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.6), poor knowledge of CL (AOR: 4.02, 95% CI: 1.81 to 9.76) and living with domestic animals (AOR: 5.29, 95% CI 3.24 to 7.5) were identified as predictors of CL. Conclusion In the study area, the magnitude of CL was found to be high. Being male and young, having low educational status, having poor knowledge and living with domestic animals increase the risk of acquiring CL. As a result, increasing the knowledge of the community through scaling up of health education programmes and reducing activities that increase individuals' exposure to sandflies should be prioritised. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Pyrethroid resistance observed in populations of malaria vectors is widespread in Ethiopia and could potentially compromise the effectiveness of insecticide-based malaria vector control interventions. In this study, the impact of combining indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) on mosquito behaviour and mortality was evaluated using experimental huts. METHODS: A Latin Square Design was employed using six experimental huts to collect entomological data. Human volunteers slept in huts with different types of nets (pyrethroid-only net, PBO net, and untreated net) either with or without IRS (Actellic 300CS). The hut with no IRS and an untreated net served as a negative control. The study was conducted for a total of 54 nights. Both alive and dead mosquitoes were collected from inside nets, in the central rooms and verandah the following morning. Data were analysed using Stata/SE 14.0 software package (College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: The personal protection rate of huts with PermaNet® 2.0 alone and PermaNet® 3.0 alone was 33.3% and 50%, respectively. The mean killing effect of huts with PermaNet® 2.0 alone and PermaNet® 3.0 alone was 2% and 49%, respectively. Huts with PermaNet® 2.0 alone and PermaNet® 3.0 alone demonstrated significantly higher excito-repellency than the control hut. However, mosquito mortality in the hut with IRS + untreated net, hut with IRS + PermaNet® 2.0 and hut with IRS + PermaNet® 3.0 were not significantly different from each other (p > 0.05). Additionally, pre-exposure of both the susceptible Anopheles arabiensis laboratory strain and wild Anopheles gambiae sensu lato to PBO in the cone bioassay tests of Actellic 300CS sprayed surfaces did not reduce mosquito mortality when compared to mortality without pre-exposure to PBO. CONCLUSION: Mosquito mortality rates from the huts with IRS alone were similar to mosquito mortality rates from the huts with the combination of vector control intervention tools (IRS + ITNs) and mosquito mortality rates from huts with PBO nets alone were significantly higher than huts with pyrethroid-only nets. The findings of this study help inform studies to be conducted under field condition for decision-making for future selection of cost-effective vector control intervention tools.

N2  - The large-scale use of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), over the last two decades, has resulted in a dramatic reduction of malaria incidence globally. However, the effectiveness of these interventions is now being threatened by numerous factors, such as resistance to insecticide in the mosquito vector and their preference to feed and rest outdoors or early in the evening (when humans are not protected by the bednets). This study presents a new deterministic model for assessing the population-level impact of mosquito insecticide resistance on malaria transmission dynamics. A notable feature of the model is that it stratifies the mosquito population in terms of type (wild or resistant to insecticides) and feeding preference (indoor or outdoor). The model is rigorously analysed to gain insight into the existence and asymptotic stability properties of the various disease-free equilibria of the model namely the trivial disease-free equilibrium, the non-trivial resistant-only boundary disease-free equilibrium and a non-trivial disease-free equlibrium where both the wild and resistant mosquito geneotypes co-exist). Simulations of the model, using data relevant to malaria transmission dynamics in Ethiopia (a malaria-endemic nation), show that the use of optimal ITNs alone, or in combination with optimal IRS, is more effective than the singular implementation of an optimal IRS-only strategy. Further, when the effect of the fitness cost of insecticide resistance with respect to fecundity (i.e., assuming a decrease in the baseline birth rate of new resistant-type adult female mosquitoes) is accounted for, numerical simulations of the model show that the combined optimal ITNs-IRS strategy could lead to the effective control of the disease, and insecticide resistance effectively managed during the first 8 years of the 15-year implementation period of the insecticides-based anti-malaria control measures in the community.

N2  - Coffee is an important crop in Mexico. Unfortunately, coffee production has been affected by coffee leaf rust (CLR). For Veracruz, the second state in Mexco with the major production of coffee, there are available reports of weekly CLR severity, but these are only informative without in-depth inferential anaysis. We analyzed variations of CLR severity along the year in Veracruz with data from municipal weekly reports provided by Mexico’s federal governmenphytosanitary epidemiological monitoring coffee program. We selected reports dated in 2018 from nine municipalities and after calculations of meamonthly severity values, we conducted a one-way ANOVA (months as factors) of severity data. We compared this information with other coffee-producinregions. Additionally, we explored the association of temperature, rainfall, and altitude with CLR severity using Principal Component Analysis and multipllinear regressions. Temperature and rainfall data were obtained from Mexican National Meteorological Service. We found that CLR severity in OctobeNovember, December, and January (months of harvest period) was significantly higher than values from March-June. During the harvest period, coffeplants allocate resources mainly for fruiting which competes in resources for other tasks such as defense and leaf growth, so this competition of resourcecan explain the positive relationship found between fruit load and CLR severity. This monthly variation of severity was similar to those reported in ChiapaGuatemala, Colombia, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Our model (R2 = 0.948) showed a significant and negative effect of minimum and maximum temperatur(in a range from 9.9 – 15.5 °C and 18.5 – 26.5 °C, respectively) on CLR severity, while the effect of rainfall (in a range from 32.0 – 359.9 mm) and medium temperature (from 14.3 – 20.5 °C) was positive. With our study, we suggest applications of fungicides in March-June when coffee plantations are in leaphenophase. © 2023, Editora UFLA. All rights reserved.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria remains the most important public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas. Mothers' or caregivers' ability to recognize childhood malaria-related morbidity is crucial as knowledge, attitudes and health seeking behavior of caregivers towards childhood malaria could influence response to signs of the disease. METHODS: A total of 1,003 caregivers in 'at-risk' villages in close proximity to the Gilgel-Gibe hydroelectric dam in south-western Ethiopia, and 953 caregivers in 'control' villages further away from the dam were surveyed using structured questionnaires to assess their knowledge, perceptions and health seeking behaviour about childhood malaria. RESULTS: Malaria (busa) was ranked as the most serious health problem. Caregivers perceived childhood malaria as a preventable ('at-risk' 96%, 'control' 86%) and treatable ('at-risk' 98% and 'control' 96%) disease. Most caregivers correctly associated the typical clinical manifestations with malaria attacks. The use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) was mentioned as a personal protective measure, whereas the role of indoor residual spraying (IRS) in malaria prevention and control was under-recognized. Most of the caregivers would prefer to seek treatment in health-care services in the event of malaria and reported the use of recommended anti-malarials. CONCLUSION: Health education to improve knowledge, perceptions and health-seeking behaviour related to malaria is equally important for caregivers in 'at risk' villages and caregivers in 'control' villages as minimal differences seen between both groups. Concluding, there may be a need of more than one generation after the introduction of the dam before differences can be noticed. Secondly, differences in prevalence between 'control' and 'at-risk' villages may not be sufficient to influence knowledge and behaviour.

N2  - Introduction Anorectal malformations (ARMs) are birth defects that affect the rectum, anus, and surrounding structures. While genetic and environmental factors may contribute to the risk of developing ARMs, the exact causes are largely unknown. Notably, there is a lack of research investigating predisposing factors for ARMs within the Ethiopian population, despite the burden of this condition in the country. Objective The research study aimed at to examine the maternal risk factors linked to the occurrence of anorectal abnormalities in children receiving treatment at designated public hospitals located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods An unmatched case-control study was conducted at selected hospitals on mothers and their children between August 2022 and January 2023. The sample consisted of pediatric patients admitted to pediatric surgical units. Cases were diagnosed with ARMs, while controls had no congenital anomalies. Data was collected from the mothers of both cases and controls. The data was validated and then exported to SPSS version 26 for analysis. The analysis employed descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. In a multivariable model, an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) together with a 95% confidence interval and p-value < 0.05 was used to determine significance. Result This study included 68 ARM cases and 136 controls. Multivariable analysis found that a family history of birth defects (AOR = 6.15, 95% CI: 1.24-30.58), maternal alcohol use (AOR = 4.71, 95% CI: 1.71-12.00), first-trimester medication use (AOR = 4.86, 95% CI: 1.29- 18.32), advanced maternal age (AOR = 4.22, 95% CI: 1.21-14.69), and unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 3.701, 95% CI: 1.551-8.828) were significant risk factors for ARM. Conclusion The study found that key risk factors for ARM include family history of birth defects, maternal alcohol use, first-trimester medication use, advanced maternal age, and unplanned pregnancy. These findings underscore the importance of tailored prevention strategies and screening programs to address the genetic, maternal lifestyle, and maternal health factors that contribute to this congenital disorder. © 2024 Solomon et al.

N2  - Cockroaches have been regarded as possible vectors of human enteropathogens. Their presence and crawl particularly in food handling establishments could be risky for human health. Therefore, this study was done to determine the vector potential of cockroach for medically important bacterial pathogens in restaurants and cafeterias. A cross-sectional study was conducted on cockroaches from restaurants and cafeterias in Jimma town from May to September 2014. Standard taxonomic keys and microbiological techniques were applied for species identification and isolation. Data was analyzed in SPSS version 16.0. All cockroaches trapped were the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.) (Dictyoptera: Blattidae). Escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated followed by Salmonella species (serogroups B, D, E, C1, and NG), Bacillus cereus, and Shigella flexneri. Wide varieties of bacteria of medical relevance were also identified. Of which, Klebsiella spp. 49(40.8%), Bacillus spp., and Staphylococcus saprophyticus were predominant. Blattella germanica (L.) (Dictyoptera: Blattidae) could serve as a potential vector for the dissemination of foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella spp., Shigella flexneri, E. coli, S. aureus, and B. cereus and these bacteria could be a major threat to public health. Therefore, environmental sanitation and standard hygiene need to be applied in the food handling establishments in that locality. © 2016 Fithamlak Solomon et al.

N2  - This study endeavoured to measure the technical efficiency of large-scale agricultural investment in Northwest Ethiopia. Besides, it strives to fathom the socioeconomic attributes and farm management techniques that influence technical inefficiency. This study uses the stochastic frontier approach to estimate the technical efficiency based on the cross-section data of 200 investors selected through a multiple-stage random sampling technique. The study established that better utilization of capital, labour, land, and seed inputs was reflected positively (albeit proportionally less) in grain output; however, the influence of agrochemical inputs was negative. The study highlighted the positive role of gender and level of education in improving technical efficiency, whereas on the other hand, age, occupation, district, and subsidies contributed to technical inefficiency. The study found that the overall mean technical efficiency for the study area was 71.7%, meaning that producers produce grain at a loss of around 28.3% due to technical inefficiency. As a result, it might be said that producers use their technology and resources somewhat inefficiently. The outcome of the study calls for more education for adults, and female producers should be encouraged and given the opportunity to manage the large-scale grain farming segment. In addition, the government is compelled to provide strategies about proper input appliances and set up a pilot research institution in the study area. © 2023

N2  - Musca sorbens (Diptera: Muscidae) flies are thought to be vectors of the blinding eye disease trachoma, carrying the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) between the eyes of individuals. While their role as vectors has been convincingly demonstrated via randomised controlled trials in The Gambia, studies of fly-borne trachoma transmission remain scant and as such our understanding of their ability to transmit Ct remains poor. We examined fly-eye contact and caught eye-seeking flies from 494 individuals (79% aged ≤9 years) in Oromia, Ethiopia. Ct-carrying flies (harbouring Ct DNA) were found to cluster spatially in and nearby to households in which at least one resident had Ct infection. Fly-eye contact was positively associated with the presence of trachoma (disease), lower human body weight and increased human body temperature. Studies of laboratory-reared M. sorbens indicated that Ct is found both externally and internally following feeds on Ct culture, with scanning electron microscopy revealing how Ct bodies can cling to fly hairs (setae). Testing for Ct on field-caught M. sorbens found fly ‘bodies’ (thorax, wings and abdomen) to consistently test positive for Ct while legs and heads were infrequently Ct-positive. These studies strongly support the role of M. sorbens as vectors of trachoma and highlight the need for improved understanding of fly-borne trachoma transmission dynamics and vector competence. © 2024 Robinson et al.

N2  - Essential oils (EOs) are volatile compounds that can serve as alternatives to chemical pesticides for the management of plant pests, including fungal pathogens. The current study was carried out to investigate the chemical composition and antifungal activities of EO extracted from three plants, Thymus vulgaris, Coriandrum sativum and Cymbopogon martini, grown in southwestern Ethiopia. EOs were extracted from the leaves of each plant by hydro distillation using a Clevenger apparatus. The chemical composition of the oils was analyzed by Gas chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), and their inhibitory effects were tested against mycotoxigenic fungi isolated from maize kernels belonging to Aspergillus and Fusarium. Chemical analysis revealed the presence of 32 compounds in C. sativum with hexanedioic acid, bis (2-ethylhexyl) ester (46.9%) and 2-Decenal (E)-(12.6%) being the dominant compounds. T. vulgaris contained 25 compounds, of which thymol (34.4%) and o-cymene (17.5%) were the major components. Twenty-five compounds were detected in C. martinii of which geraniol (51.4%) and geranyl acetate (14.5%) were dominant. The EOs of the tested plants had very high antifungal activity (up to 100% efficacy) against Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Fusarium graminearum and F. verticillioides in vitro and on maize grains. The anti-fungal activities of these EOs were dependent on their major components, including thymol, hexanedioic acid, bis (2-ethylhexyl) ester and geraniol. This study confirmed the potential of EOs as bio-fungicides for the management of mycotoxigenic fungi associated with maize. This could reduce the health impacts of mold and toxigenic compounds produced in maize in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner. © 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic Plasmodium infection (API) that occurs during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirths, abortion, premature delivery, and low birth weight. API also hinders the control and prevention of malaria as infected hosts serve as silent reservoirs for transmission of Plasmodium species in the community. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of API and associated factors among pregnant women. This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Merti district, Oromia, Ethiopia among 364 pregnant women from March to September 2018. METHODS: Sociodemographic and obstetrics features were collected using a structured questionnaire. About 2ml of blood was collected from participants to detect Plasmodium species, gametocyte carriage rate, parasite density, and anemia. RESULTS: The prevalence of API among pregnant women was 3.6%. The proportion of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax was 6(46.2%) and 7(53.8%) respectively. Out of 13 Plasmodium species identified, Gametocyte carriage rate was 4(30.7%). The geometric mean density of the asexual stage of the parasites was 994.7(interquartile [IQR], 320 to 2200) parasites/ul. The geometric mean gametocyte density was 303.3 (interquartile range [IQR], 160 to 600). The proportion of anemia among Plasmodium-infected participants was 12(92.3%). Previous infection by Plasmodium species (AOR = 5.42; 95% CI: 1.19-29.03, p = 0.047), lack of insecticide-treated bed net use (AOR = 6.52; 95% CI: 1.17-36.44, p = 0.032), and living close to stagnant water (AOR = 4.18; 95% CI (1.12-17.36, p = 0.049) were significantly associated with API. Anemia was significantly higher among Plasmodium-infected than non-infected pregnant women (x2 = 27.62, p <0.001). CONCLUSION: In the current study, a relatively high prevalence of API was detected among pregnant women. Identifying API in the community is important to prevent the unwanted outcomes of Plasmodium infection and its transmission.

N2  - Low-income countries are struggling with the health impacts of both surface and groundwater chemical contamination. Although the impact of biological contaminants on children's health is acknowledged, the long-term effects of these and emerging contaminants on young children may be underestimated. To map the existing evidence on health impacts of water contaminated with chemicals on young children (<5 years), we conducted a scoping review to select and organize relevant literature. Of the 98 studies in the review, 24 revealed that the hazard ratio of arsenic, nitrates, cadmium, and fluoride (all of which are on the World Health Organisation's list of 10 chemicals of public health concern) was higher in very young children than in older age groups. Anthropogenic activities (textile manufacturing, waste disposal, and intensified agriculture) are leading contributors to the release of chemicals to groundwater used for drinking. Three major pathways for chemical contamination exposure in young children were confirmed: maternal transmission during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and early school years. Children exhibited acute and chronic disruptions to their neurological, skeletal, reproductive, and endocrine systems, as well as cumulative carcinogenic risks, amongst other life-altering consequences. The lack of research on emerging contaminants' effects on young children in low-income countries is worrisome, as their increased use may compound the issues caused by the existing problem of “legacy chemicals.” Precautionary principle should regulate the operation of industries producing these chemicals in a robust manner. Evidence from major producers and exporters in high-income countries is sufficient to warrant action, even without waiting for direct harm to be observed in low-income countries. Literature recommends prioritising prevention of contamination over demand side treatment or finding alternative water sources, especially in water-scarce areas affected by climate change. Local and transnational efforts are required to enforce safer industry practices and prevent further water quality deterioration in low-income countries. © 2023 The Authors

N2  - Mosquitoes have been a nuisance and health threat to humans for centuries due to their ability to transmit different infectious diseases. Biological control methods have emerged as an alternative or complementary approach to contain vector populations in light of the current spread of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the predation efficacy of selected potential predators against Anopheles mosquito larvae. Potential invertebrate predators and Anopheles larvae were collected from natural habitats, mainly (temporary) wetlands and ponds in southwest Ethiopia and experiments were conducted under laboratory conditions. Optimal predation conditions with respect to larval instar, water volume and number of predators were determined for each of the seven studied predators. Data analyses were carried out using the Poisson regression model using one way ANOVA at the 5% significant level. The backswimmer (Notonectidae) was the most aggressive predator on Anopheles mosquito larvae with a daily mean predation of 71.5 larvae (95% CI: [65.04;78.59]). Our study shows that larval instar, water volume and number of predators have a significant effect on each predator, except for dragonflies (Libellulidae), with regard to the preference of the larval instar. A selection of mosquito predators has the potential to control Anopheles mosquito larvae, suggesting that they can be used as complementary approach in an integrated malaria vector control strategy.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Despite a high public health burden of malaria in endemic regions of Ethiopia, there are limitations on the availability of data concerning public awareness about the disease and its preventive measures. The present study aimed in producing base line data on the community knowledge, attitudes and practices towards malaria transmission and its preventive measures in Woreta town, northwest Ethiopia. A community based two-stage random cluster study was conducted from May to July 2013. Household heads were interviewed to assess their awareness about malaria and its control measures. RESULTS: About 78.5% (113/144) of the respondents rated bite of infected mosquito as a way of malaria transmission. The majority of participants, 126 (87.5%) stated one or more symptoms of malaria. About 95.8% (138/144) of the respondents indicated that malaria is preventable and curable disease. Only about 25% (36/144) of the study participants practiced frequent and proper use of insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs). Draining logged water was a highly rated, 83 (57.6%), practice of environmental management of malaria.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan Africa has seen substantial reductions in cases and deaths due to malaria over the past two decades. While this reduction is primarily due to an increasing expansion of interventions, urbanisation has played its part as urban areas typically experience substantially less malaria transmission than rural areas. However, this may be partially lost with the invasion and establishment of Anopheles stephensi. A. stephensi, the primary urban malaria vector in Asia, was first detected in Africa in 2012 in Djibouti and was subsequently identified in Ethiopia in 2016, and later in Sudan and Somalia. In Djibouti, malaria cases have increased 30-fold from 2012 to 2019 though the impact in the wider region remains unclear. METHODS: Here, we have adapted an existing model of mechanistic malaria transmission to estimate the increase in vector density required to explain the trends in malaria cases seen in Djibouti. To account for the observed plasticity in An. stephensi behaviour, and the unknowns of how it will establish in a novel environment, we sample behavioural parameters in order to account for a wide range of uncertainty. This quantification is then applied to Ethiopia, considering temperature-dependent extrinsic incubation periods, pre-existing vector-control interventions and Plasmodium falciparum prevalence in order to assess the potential impact of An. stephensi establishment on P. falciparum transmission. Following this, we estimate the potential impact of scaling up ITN (insecticide-treated nets)/IRS (indoor residual spraying) and implementing piperonyl butoxide (PBO) ITNs and larval source management, as well as their economic costs. RESULTS: We estimate that annual P. falciparum malaria cases could increase by 50% (95% CI 14-90) if no additional interventions are implemented. The implementation of sufficient control measures to reduce malaria transmission to pre-stephensi levels will cost hundreds of millions of USD. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial heterogeneity across the country is predicted and large increases in vector control interventions could be needed to prevent a major public health emergency.

N2  - Malaria control methods rely mostly on adult mosquito control using insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying with insecticides. Plants such as endod (Phytolacca dodecandra) can potentially be used for the control of mosquito larvae as a supplement to adult control methods. Following the discovery of endod, a molluscicide plant, more than 5 decades ago in Ethiopia, subsequent studies have shown that its potency can further be increased by simple procedures such as aging endod berry powder in water. This study was conducted to evaluate the killing effect of fresh and aged endod solution against 4th-stage larvae of Anopheles arabiensis. Laboratory-reared An. arabiensis larvae exposed to different concentrations of endod preparation using distilled or spring water had 50% lethal concentration (LC(50))  =  49.6 ppm and 90% lethal concentration (LC(90))  =  234 ppm for fresh and LC(50)  =  36.4 ppm and LC(90)  =  115.7 ppm for the aged endod solution in distilled water against the laboratory population. Against field-collected larvae of the same species, aged preparations in habitat water resulted in higher LC(50) (472.7 ppm) and LC(90) (691 ppm) values, with only a slight improvement over fresh preparations in habitat water (LC(50)  =  456.2 ppm; LC(90)  =  896.1 ppm). In general, although aged preparations of endod required lower concentrations than fresh to kill at least 90% of the larvae, these concentrations were much higher (12-70×) than that required for schistosome-transmitting snails.

N2  - Freshwater resources are of critical importance to both natural ecosystems and human development. The health of aquatic ecosystems is dependent on right proportions and required succession of major nutrients in the water and sediment. Surface water pollution by agrochemicals has become a growing threat to the human society and natural ecosystems in the recent decades. Lake Tana is the largest fresh water body in Ethiopia, located at an altitude of 1786 m above sea level. The lake has an average depth of 9 m and maximum depth of 14 m with surface area of 3150 km 2 . The lake is an economically important shallow lake in the country and is threatened by anthropogenic and climatic factors. Excess agrochemicals input from agricultural activities and industrial effluent around Lake Tana watershed can pose a serious threat on the lake ecosystem by expansion of water hyacinth. The study was made to investigate the spatio-temporal variations of selected water quality parameters and trophic status of Lake Tana for sustainable management options for sustainable use of the lake. Different environmental samples such as water and sediment were collected from fourteen representative sampling sites of the lake for the measurement of physicochemical parameters and nutrients in both dry and wet seasonal basis. The physicochemical parameters were measured in-situ with portable multimeter and nutrients and chlorophyll a were determined by following the standard procedures outlined in the American Public Health Association (APHA) using UV/Visible spectrophotometer. The trophic status of the lake was determined using trophic state variable and Carlson model. The lake water quality level was also evaluated using comprehensive evaluation index model. There were spatio-temporal variations in the physico-chemical parameters and nutrients in the lake ecosystem during the study period. Higher concentrations of nutrients, electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solid (TDS) were recorded in sampling sites of effluents of the some resort and the major feeding rivers in all seasons. The values of the comprehensive pollution index ranged from 0.68 to 1.01 and 0.91 to 1.69 during dry and wet seasons respectively. According to the values of comprehensive pollution index, the lake is moderately and slightly polluted in dry and wet seasons, respectively. The values for SRP, and TP distributions were higher in the wet season in most of the sampling sites. Carlson trophic state model showed the average values of Carlson Trophic State Index (CTSI) of Lake Tana were found to be 69.77 and clearly indicated Lake Tana TSI value lies well above the minimum value for eutrophic condition. In order to stop further deterioration of lake water quality and to eventually restore the beneficial uses of the lake, management of agrochemicals in the lake watershed should be given urgent priority. It is mandatory to prepare guidelines for the trophic status of the Ethiopian freshwater bodies in the country by making bottom-up-down discussion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Innovative vector control tools are needed to counteract insecticide resistance and residual malaria transmission. One of such innovative methods is an ivermectin (IVM) treatment to reduce vector survival. In this study, a laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of ivermectin on survivorship, fertility and egg hatchability rate of Anopheles arabiensis in Ethiopia. METHODS: An in vitro experiment was conducted using 3-5 days old An. arabiensis adults from a colony maintained at insectary of Tropical and Infectious Diseases Research Center, Jimma University (laboratory population) and Anopheles mosquitoes reared from larvae collected from natural mosquito breeding sites (wild population). The mosquitoes were allowed to feed on cattle blood treated with different doses of ivermectin (0 ng/ml, 5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml and 80 ng/ml). During each feeding experiment, the mosquitoes were held in cages and blood-fed using a Hemotek feeder. Mortality and egg production were then recorded daily for up to 9 days. Time to death was analysed by a Cox frailty model with replicate as frailty term and source of mosquito (wild versus laboratory), treatment type (ivermectin vs control) and their interaction as categorical fixed effects. Kaplan Meier curves were plotted separately for wild and laboratory populations for a visual interpretation of mosquito survival as a function of treatment. RESULTS: Both mosquito source and treatment had a significant effect on survival (P < 0.001), but their interaction was not significant (P = 0.197). Compared to the controls, the death hazard of An. arabiensis that fed on ivermectin-treated blood was 2.3, 3.5, 6.5, 11.5 and 17.9 times that of the control for the 5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml, and 80 ng/ml dose, respectively. With respect to the number of hatched larvae, hatched pupae and emerged adults per fed mosquitoes, a significant difference was found between the control and the 5 ng/ml dose group (P < 0.001). The number of hatched larvae and pupae, and emerged adults decreased further for the 10 ng/ml dose group and falls to zero for the higher doses. CONCLUSION: Treating cattle blood with ivermectin reduced mosquito survival, fertility, egg hatchability, larval development and adult emergence of An. arabiensis in all tested concentrations of ivermectin in both the wild and laboratory populations. Thus, ivermectin application in cattle could be used as a supplementary vector control method to tackle residual malaria transmission and ultimately achieve malaria elimination in Ethiopia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLITN) have demonstrated significant impact in reducing malaria-related childhood morbidity and mortality. However, utilization of LLITN by under-five children is not satisfactory in many sub-Saharan African countries due to behavioural barriers. Previous studies had focused on the coverage and ownership of LLITN. The effect of skill-based training for household heads on LLITN utilization had not yet been investigated. A cluster-randomized trial on the effect of training of household heads on the use of LLITN was done in Ethiopia to fill this knowledge gap. METHODS: The study included 22 (11 intervention and 11 control) villages in southwest Ethiopia. The intervention consisted of tailored training of household heads about the proper use of LLITN and community network system. All households in each group received free LLITN. Data were collected at baseline, six and 12 months of the follow up periods. Utilization of LLITN in the control and intervention villages was compared at baseline and follow up periods. RESULTS: A total of 21,673; 14,735 and 13,758 individuals were included at baseline, sixth and twelfth months of the project period. At the baseline survey, 47.9% of individuals in the intervention villages and 68.4% in the control villages reported that they had utilized LLITN the night before the survey. At the six month, 81.0% of individuals in the intervention villages and 79.3% in the control villages had utilized LLITN. The utilization of LLITN in all age groups in the intervention villages was increased by 17.7 percentage point (95% CI 9.7-25.6) at sixth month and by 31.0 percentage point (95% CI 16.9-45.1) at the twelfth month. Among under-five children, the LLITN utilization increased by 31.6 percentage point (95% CI 17.3-45.8) at the sixth month and 38.4 percentage point (95% CI 12.1-64.7) at the twelfth months of the project period. CONCLUSION: Household level skill-based training has demonstrated a marked positive effect in the utilization of LLITN. The effect of the intervention steadily increased overtime. Therefore, distribution of LLITN should be accompanied by a skill-based training of household heads to improve its utilization.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern of malaria transmission where prevention and control measures are in place will help to fine-tune strategies. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of mass distribution of bednets and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides on the spatio-temporal clustering of malaria in one malaria endemic village in south Ethiopia. METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted from April 2009 to April 2011. The average population was 6631 in 1346 locations. We used active and passive searches for malaria cases for 101 weeks. SatScan v9.1.1 was used to identify statistically significant retrospective space-time clusters. A discrete Poisson based model was applied with the aim of identifying areas with high rates. PASW Statistics 18 was used to build generalized Poisson loglinear model. RESULTS: The total number of both types of malaria episodes was 622, giving 45.1 episodes per 1000 persons per year; among these, episodes of Plasmodium falciparum and vivax infection numbered 316 (22.9 per 1000 per year) and 306 (22.2 per 1000 per year), respectively. IRS with Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and later with Deltamethrin and free mass distribution of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) were carried out during the study period. There was space-time clustering of malaria episodes at a household level. The spatio-temporal clustering of malaria was not influenced by free mass distribution of ITNs; however, the time-span of the spatio-temporal clustering of malaria cases ended after IRS with Deltamethrin. The presence of clusters on the south-east edge of the village was consistent with the finding of an increasing risk of acquiring malaria infection for individuals who lived closer to the identified vector breeding site. CONCLUSION: The risk of getting malaria infection varied significantly within one village. Free mass distribution of ITNs did not influence the spatio-temporal clustering of malaria, but IRS might have eliminated malaria clustering.

N2  - Potato late blight (Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) De Bary) is the major constraint of potato production in Ethiopia. The field experiment was done at Meket district during 2018 cropping season, to determine appropriate spraying frequency combined with different levels of resistance variety. The experiment had 15 treatments with a combination of three potato varieties (Belete, Gudene, and Jalene) and five spraying frequencies (zero, one, two, three, and four times spray). The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design in factorial combination with three replications. The combination of potato varieties and spraying frequencies of Ridomil applications showed statistically significant on the disease, yield, and yield component parameters. The highest disease severity (84.76%) was obtained from untreated Jalene variety. The maximum tuber yield (29.62 t ha −1) was obtained from Belete variety sprayed with two-time spraying. Whereas the lowest tuber yield (12.93 t ha−1) was recorded from untreated Jalene variety. Moreover, the highest (1774.65%) marginal rate of return was obtained from Belete variety treated with one spray. Finally, it is concluded that for moderately resistance one spray, moderately susceptible two sprays and four sprays for susceptible varieties were found better management options and get the highest cost-benefit as compared with other treatment combinations. © 2021 The Author(s).

N2  - Climate variability threatens food system stability, particularly among smallholders in developing countries who depend on rainfed agriculture. Farm diversification could be a relevant adaptation strategy in this context as a greater number of species or a more even distribution of crops is postulated to have a stabilizing effect on farm output as compared to a homogeneous farm. In this study, we aimed to explore relationships between climate variability, agricultural diversity, and crop yield stability. We used agriculture-focused panel data from Ethiopian households surveyed over four waves from 2011 to 2018 and two climate datasets to derive measures of long- and short-term climate variability. In a twofold analytical approach, we used mixed effects models to separately model (i) farm richness and pastoralism prevalence with climate variability as predictors, and (ii) crop yield stability with diversity, farm input, and climate characteristics as predictors. We found that farm diversity is highest in areas with high temperature variability, or low rainfall variability. This held even when excluding pastoralist households, who have naturally lower diversity. We further showed that pastoralism is least common in areas with high temperature variability and low month-to-month rainfall variability. Both crop richness and crop evenness positively affected temporal yield stability, with each showing a greater effect than irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticide usage. Together, these findings suggest that shifts in typical ranges of climate variability could destabilize farm-level crop yield for smallholders by limiting diversification opportunities. Our findings highlight the need for researchers and policymakers to consider not only the direct effects of climate variability on crop yield, but also its indirect effects on yield stability caused by increasingly limited adaptation choices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

N2  - Kala azar occurs among seasonal and migrant agricultural workers in northwest Ethiopia and accounts for almost 60% of the disease burden in the country. We conducted a quantitative study on the level of knowledge and practice of this vulnerable group in relation to kala azar transmission and acceptability of its vector control tools. A total of 403 workers were randomly selected from eight farms using a purposive sampling technique. Knowledge and practice scores were calculated based on 12 and 9 core questions, respectively. Binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with knowledge and practice. A large gap in knowledge of the disease and the vector was evident with 61.8%, 24.6%, and 13.6% of the workers having poor, moderate, and good levels of knowledge scores, respectively. Similarly, 95% of the seasonal workers reported poor level of use of protective measures against the bite of the sand fly vector. Good level of knowledge about kala azar and its sand fly vector was statistically associated with formal education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.11; 95% CI = 1.17, 3.80; P < 0.05) and previous exposure to health education (AOR = 4.72; 95% CI = 1.99, 11.16; P < 0.001). Despite poor current knowledge and practice, a large proportion of the study participants showed interest in using vector control tools if made available, with 78% of the seasonal and migrant workers expressing some willingness to pay for different measures that can protect against sand fly bites. Therefore, we strongly recommend that comprehensive health education and vector control programs should be provided to these workers.

N2  - Excess agrochemicals input from agricultural activities and industrial effluent around Lake Ziway catchment can pose a serious threat on the lake ecosystem. Lake Ziway is a shallow freshwater lake found in the northern part of the Ethiopian Rift Valley. It is characterized as semi-arid to sub-humid type of climate. Expansions of the flower industry, widespread fisheries, intensive agricultural activities, fast population growth lead to deterioration of water quality and depletion of aquatic biota. The spatial and temporal variations of selected water quality parameters were evaluated using multivariate techniques. The data were collected from nine sampling stations during dry and wet seasonal basis for analysis of fifteen water quality parameters. The physicochemical parameters were measured in-situ with portable multimeter and nutrients were determined by following the standard procedures outlined in the American Public Health Association using UV/Visible spectrophotometer. Mean nutrient concentrations showed increasing trend in all seasons. These sites were also characterized by high electrical conductivity and total dissolved solid (TDS). All the nine sampling sites were categorized into three pollution levels according to their water quality features using cluster analysis (CA). Accordingly, sampling sites Fb and Ketar River (Kb) are highly and moderately polluted in both seasons, respectively. On the other hand, sampling sites at the center (C), Meki river mouth (Ma), Ketar river mouth (Ka), Meki River (Mb), Korekonch (Ko) and Fa in dry season and Ka, C, Ma, Ko, Bulbula river mouth (B) and Fa during wet season were less polluted. Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis also showed the pollutant sources were mainly from Fb during dry season Mb and Kb during wet season. The values of comprehensive pollution index illustrated the lake is moderately and slightly polluted in dry and wet seasons, respectively. Comparatively, the pollution status of the lake is high around floriculture effluent discharge site and at the two feeding rivers (Kb and Mb) due to increasing trends in agrochemical loads. In order to stop further deterioration of the lake water quality and to eventually restore the beneficial uses of the lake, management of agrochemicals in the lake catchments should be given urgent priority. © 2022, The Author(s).

N2  - Spodoptera frugiperda is considered the most severe maize pest in the world and Ethiopia as well. A survey was conducted during the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons to determine the distribution, relative importance, and the association between S. frugiperda intensity and biophysical factors. A total of 375 maize fields were surveyed during the two cropping seasons. The spatiotemporal analysis revealed that there was a 100% prevalence of the S. frugiperda with various degrees in both cropping seasons. However, significant variations were observed in the pest incidence and plant damage severity of S. frugiperda among the surveyed districts in the two seasons. There were higher pest incidence and plant damage severity in 2017 than in the 2018 cropping season. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association of S. frugiperda with biophysical factors. Higher (> 75% for both cropping seasons) S. frugiperda plant damage severity was highly associated with Denba Gofa, Zala, Arba Minch, cropping system, altitude, pest management, insecticide spray frequency, and weeding practice with variable levels of significance. Lower plant damage severity of S. frugiperda was highly associated with Burji, high intercropping, altitude, a cultural plus insecticide used in pest management, more than two times insecticide applications, and high weeding practice. The study suggests proper pest management practices should be carried out to reduce S. frugiperda damaged to the maize crop. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is becoming a major health problem in urban areas. Community perceptions, knowledge and practices have a major role in the implementation of effective malaria control interventions. Yet little is known about the perceptions and practices of urban community about urban malaria prevention and control. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of an urban community about malaria prevention and control. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in three randomly selected malarious Kebeles of Gondar Town during November-December 2004. Knowledge, attitudes and practices were assessed for 489 household members > or =18 years old. RESULTS: Almost all respondents knew about malaria and recognized it as one of the major health problems of the community. About 58% knew that malaria could be transmitted from one person to another, and most (97.2%) associated malaria with the bite of mosquito. The most frequently reported symptoms of malaria included fever (96.3%), chills and shivering (96.3%), headache (96.1%), loss of appetite (92.2%) and joini pain (90.2%). Knowledge about the names of the currently used antimalarials, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (90.4%) and chloroquine (81.6%), was high. About 39% of the total 163 surveyed households possessed at least one mosquito net; of these, 55 (83.7%) possessed one, 7 (11%) had two and 2 (2.3%) possessed three. Most respondents practiced draining stagnant water (46.3%) and clearing vegetation (43.3%) for malaria prevention. CONCLUSIONS: Although considerable gaps were observed between knowledge and practices of malaria prevention and control methods, community knowledge, attitudes and practices on the cause, treatment and prevention of the disease were encouraging. Since malaria is identified as a major health problem, the use of personal protection methods such as insecticide treated mosquito nets should be encouraged through increasing access to it.

N2  - More than half of the world’s population consumes rice. Recently, the area sown with modern rice varieties has expanded, and the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has increased in various countries. Wetland hydrology is also influenced by chemical and physical characteristics. Hence, this research focused on temporal and spatial changes in crop patterns, input usage, and hydrology in the Ethiopian Fogera floodplain, with the following objectives: (a) What are the spatial and temporal trends in crop production patterns? (b) What input changes have occurred to produce rice and other crops? (c) What hydrological changes have occurred in the area with intensification of production systems? Primary data were gathered through a questionnaire, focus group discussions, interviews, and field observations. Secondary data were obtained from Landsat imageries, the SWAT model, water flow measurements, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI results indicated that the area cultivated for rice is increasing while the area of other crops is decreasing. Agricultural inputs are used in rice systems but were not used before the introduction of rice. Recession farming activities have also diminished wetland areas. Water flow showed a decrease, whereas Nitrogen and Phosphorus showed an increase with Pearson’s correlation values −0.069 and −0.072, respectively. Flow of water was negatively correlated with N and P water concentration, whereas N and P contents were positively correlated. In conclusion, growth of intensive rice systems has had negative environmental consequences on wetland ecology. Therefore, policies to regulate and manage wetland uses are recommended. © 2021 by the authors.

N2  - Feeding behaviour of the malaria vector Anopheles arabiensis Patton (Diptera: Culicidae) was monitored for 12 months (March 2003-February 2004) in the Konso District of southern Ethiopia (5 degrees 15'N, 37 degrees 28'E). More than 45 000 An. arabiensis females were collected by host-baited sampling methods (light-traps, human landing catches, cattle-baited traps) and from resting sites (huts and pit shelters). In the village of Fuchucha, where the ratio of cattle : humans was 0.6 : 1, 51% of outdoor-resting mosquitoes and 66% of those collected indoors had fed on humans, human baits outdoors caught > 2.5 times more mosquitoes than those indoors and the mean catch of mosquitoes from pit shelters was about five times that from huts. Overall, the vast majority of feeding and resting occurred outdoors. In the cattle camps of Konso, where humans slept outdoors close to their cattle, approximately 46% of resting mosquitoes collected outdoors had fed on humans despite the high cattle : human ratio (17 : 1). In both places, relatively high proportions of bloodmeals were mixed cow + human: 22-25% at Fuchucha and 37% in the cattle camps. Anthropophily was also gauged experimentally by comparing the numbers of mosquitoes caught in odour-baited entry traps baited with either human or cattle odour. The human-baited trap caught about five times as many mosquitoes as the cattle-baited one. Notwithstanding the potential pitfalls of using standard sampling devices to analyse mosquito behaviour, the results suggest that the An. arabiensis population is inherently anthropophagic, but this is counterbalanced by exophagic and postprandial exophilic tendencies. Consequently, the population feeds sufficiently on humans to transmit malaria (sporozoite rates: 0.3% for Plasmodium falciparum and 0.5% for P. vivax, by detection of circumsporozoite antigen) but also takes a high proportion of meals from non-human hosts, with 59-91% of resting mosquitoes containing blood from cattle. Hence, classical zooprophylaxis is unlikely to have a significant impact on the malaria vectorial capacity of An. arabiensis in Konso, whereas treating cattle with insecticide might do.

N2  - The article examines how heads of farmers’ households perceive the socioeconomic benefits of Lake Ziway (Ethiopia), the causes of its current degradation, and the state of land and water use management in its watershed. The investigation was based on in-depth empirical field work including a survey with 635 heads of smallholder farmers’ households via interview using semi-structured questionnaires. Further, water abstraction was estimated from three districts that border with the lake. Respondents believe that Lake Ziway provides a number of individual and collective benefits for local communities, private companies and public institution. They stated, however, that the lake is under pressure from the floriculture industry and other investment projects, high population growth and subsequent expansion of settlements and irrigation farms, high applications of agrochemicals, soil erosion, uncontrolled water abstraction, and deforestation in the watershed. The respondents further believe that these activities are degrading the lake water quality, shrinking its water volume and decreasing its fish population. After examining government's efforts to address these activities, the majority of respondents believe that the government role in the whole watershed is weak. This study contributes to better understand the local socio-ecological coherences and the problems Lake Ziway and its watershed are facing. It also provides information regarding long-term sustainable land and water use planning strategies for the lake and management of its watershed, which could also be applied to other lakes in Ethiopia, and beyond. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH

N2  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the determinants of malaria morbidity offers helpful insights toward the changing malaria situation, which might lead to the adjustment of malaria program activities. Even though the determinants of malaria morbidity remain unknown, school-aged children were the highest malaria morbidity contributors in the East Hararghe Zone. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the determinants of malaria morbidity among school-aged children in the study area from February 1 to May 31, 2020. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted among school-aged children living in ten randomly selected low, moderate, and high malaria transmission kebeles. Cases were confirmed as positive for malaria, while controls were confirmed as negative for malaria among randomly selected school-aged children. Rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) and blood film (BF) malaria testing methods were used. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify association between malaria and its determinants. RESULTS: The determinants of malaria infection were having no formal education (adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=4.91, 95% CI: 1.20-20.17), low family wealth index (AOR=2.50, 95% CI: 1.22-5.12), being from rural residence (AOR=2.34, 95% CI: 1.87-4.12), living near to stagnant water (AOR=2.01, 95% CI: 1.14-3.54), having a maximum of three family members (AOR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.18-0.78), using indoor residual spraying (IRS) (AOR=0.15, 95% CI: 0.08-0.29) and long-lasting insecticide-treated net (LLITN) over the last night (AOR=0.19, 95% CI: 0.10-0.35), and living in the house surrounded by cultivated land(AOR=0.24, 95%CI: 0.10-0.60) compared with their counterparts. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that residence, family size, education, wealth index, stagnant water existence, and using LLITN and IRS had significant association with malaria morbidity. Thus, all concerned bodies, including the community should strengthen working on stagnant water elimination around their house to cut the breeding site of the malaria vector mosquito. Moreover, the findings have an important implication for improving interventions targeting the economic status and literacy of the society that may help in the reduction of the risk of malaria in the school-aged children.

N2  - Field surveys of E. camaldulensis diseases were conducted during 2019/20 and 2020/21 in Ethiopia. This species was found the most commonly planted in the surveyed fields and were showing stem canker diseases. Sampling was done from diseased stem and branches with clear symptoms. The morphological as well as PCR assay of the ITS1 and ITS2 loci were performed to identify the fungal pathogens. Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Didymella pinodella were the identified fungi. Four nationally licensed fungicides, Vitra (copper hydroxide), Ridomil gold (Metalaxyl-M + mancozeb), Liveshow (Pyraclostrobin + Epoxiconazole), and Sabozeb (Mancozeb) were evaluated for their in vitro efficacy against these fungi at concentrations of 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 ppm for the management trial. Vitra and Liveshow were found to be the most effective fungicides at 2000 ppm for the control and treatment of Eucalyptus camaldulensis stem canker diseases. The findings from this research will provide foundation for future studies as this is the first report for the management of this Eucalyptus tree disease in Ethiopia. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Vitra and Liveshow were found to be the most effective fungicides at 2000 ppm for the control and treatment of E. camaldulensis stem canker diseases. The identification of L. theobromae and D. pinodella as causal agents of E. camaldulensis is crucial for targeted disease management strategies. The evaluation of four fungicides at different concentrations provided valuable information for selecting the most effective treatment options for practical management practices of the diseases. This research serves as the first report on the management of Eucalyptus disease in Ethiopia, laying the foundation for future studies and contributing to the development of sustainable disease management practices. The findings of this research can guide policymakers, researchers, and agricultural practitioners in implementing targeted fungicide applications to mitigate the impact of stem canker on Eucalyptus plantations and improve their productivity. © 2024 EScience Press.

N2  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: In Ethiopia, nearly 10 million insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) were distributed between 2004 and 2005; which touched 56 million in 2012. The study was aimed to determine the impact of these bednets on malaria prevalence, in Yaso district of Benishangul-Gumuz region, western Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted during the peak malaria transmission season (October-November, 2014) in the Yaso district, Benishangul-Gumuz region. Data on demographic variables, ITN ownership and malaria infection rates were collected using structured questionnaires and blood film tests and analyzed using SAS for windows software. The probability of getting infected (questionnaire and the blood film results) was regressed against groups of explanatory variables, like age, sex, bednet use etc. using multiple logistic regressions. RESULTS: The results revealed that about 40% of the study subjects (384) were positive for Plasmodium falciparum; while P. vivax, P. falciparum and mixed infections accounted for 74.5% of the study subjects. All the 384 study subjects possessed insecticide-treated bednets; 50.5% possessed one, 39.3% two and 10.2% more than two. According to the logistic regression, there was significant association between illness due to malaria and at least one of the explanatory variables (χ26= 271.9, p<0.0001). For all Plasmodium species, education level, and age appeared to be significant beneficial factors (OR<1 and negative β-values). Occupation was a significant risk factor. Proper ITN utilization improved with increasing educational status. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Schools may be appropriate for creating awareness and distribution of ITN instead of the current mass campaign, which is less effective. Efforts of stakeholders (schools, community health workers, and the government) should be integrated.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Malaria kills millions around the world. Until recently it was believed to be a disease of rural areas, since the Anopheles mosquito, which transmits Plasmodium species breeds in rural areas. Urban malaria is emerging as a potential, but "avertable" crisis, in Africa. In view of the rapidly growing number of small and medium-sized towns in Ethiopia there is a pressing need to improve the understanding of the epidemiology of malaria. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine malaria prevalence and associated risk factors in Jimma town. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in Jimma town from April 1 to May 28, 2010. 804 study participants were included from 291 households for microscopic examination of malaria parasites. Socio-demography data and risk factors were collected using structured questionnaires. Logistic regression analysis was done using SPSS 15.0 statistical software. RESULTS: From a total of 804 study participants in current survey only 42 (5.2%) were positive for malaria parasites. Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium falciparum and mixed infection accounted 71.4%, 26.2% and 2.4%, respectively. Higher malaria prevalence rate was observed among under-five children (11%). Those who do not use insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) were more likely to be infected with malaria (OR = 13.6; 95% CI 4.9-37.2, p < 0.001) compared with those who use the ITN. Living in areas where stagnant water existed (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.00-4.2, p = 0.047) and its distance of existence <1 km from the house(OR = 2.1; 95% CI 2.0-15.8, p = 0.001) were more likely to be infected with malaria parasite compared with those who live away from stagnant at a distance greater than 1 km. CONCLUSION: Malaria is a major health problem with P. vivax becoming a predominant species in the town. The prevalence was strongly associated with proximity of residence to potential mosquito breeding sites. Malaria is affecting significant proportions of the urban settlers and human activities nevertheless play an important role in bringing the mosquito breeding sites closer to residences.

N2  - The long-term and indiscriminate use of pesticides has resulted in serious health effects. Aside from that, developing countries do not have any monitoring systems in place to prevent the consumption of high levels of pesticides in foods. Therefore, this study aimed to determine pesticide residues and the effect of processing in commonly consumed vegetables in the southwestern part of Ethiopia. In total, 12 samples of 1 kg of each type of vegetable were collected from selected markets. Moreover, as a solution to pesticide residue problems in vegetables, the effect of different processing methods such as washing, peeling, boiling, and their cumulative effect was studied. In the analytical procedure, the modified Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) extraction with florisil as a cleanup sorbent was used and the identification of pesticides was done by using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). The parent p,p'-DDT was detected at a concentration of 0.015 mg/kg in potato samples from the Serbo market and a concentration of 0.516, 0.232, 0.174, and 1.512 mg/kg in Merkato, Kochi, Serbo, and Shebe onion samples, respectively. P`p-DDT is detected at a high concentration compared to its metabolites (p,p'-DDE and p,p'-DDD), which is an indication of recent use. DDT and its metabolites, other organochlorines (lindane, γ-chlordane, dimethachlor, and heptachlor), and pyrethroids (cypermethrin and deltamethrin) exceeded the recommended limits by FAO and WHO in multiple samples of potato, onion, and cabbage. The processing result showed that washing, boiling, and the combination of the two revealed a 100% reduction in o,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDT pesticides detected in cabbage. In conclusion, multiple residues were detected in the three vegetables studied, indicating that pesticides were applied intensively. Pesticide levels were reduced by home processing procedures, which is important for consumer safety.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Ethiopia is one of the African countries where Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax co-exist. Monitoring and evaluation of current malaria transmission status is an important component of malaria control as it is a measure of the success of ongoing interventions and guides the planning of future control and elimination efforts. MAIN TEXT: We evaluated changes in malaria control policy in Ethiopia, and reviewed dynamics of country-wide confirmed and clinical malaria cases by Plasmodium species and reported deaths for all ages and less than five years from 2001 to 2016. Districts level annual parasite incidence was analysed to characterize the malaria transmission stratification as implemented by the Ministry of Health. We found that Ethiopia has experienced major changes from 2003 to 2005 and subsequent adjustment in malaria diagnosis, treatment and vector control policy. Malaria interventions have been intensified represented by the increased insecticide treated net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) coverage, improved health services and improved malaria diagnosis. However, countrywide ITN and IRS coverages were low, with 64% ITN coverage in 2016 and IRS coverage of 92.5% in 2016 and only implemented in epidemic-prone areas of > 2500 m elevation. Clinical malaria incidence rate dropped from an average of 43.1 cases per 1000 population annually between 2001 and 2010 to 29.0 cases per 1000 population annually between 2011 and 2016. Malaria deaths decreased from 2.1 deaths per 100 000 people annually between 2001 and 2010 to 1.1 deaths per 100 000 people annually between 2011 to 2016. There was shrinkage in the malaria transmission map and high transmission is limited mainly to the western international border area. Proportion of P. falciparum malaria remained nearly unchanged from 2000 to 2016 indicating further efforts are needed to suppress transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria morbidity and mortality have been significantly reduced in Ethiopia since 2001, however, malaria case incidence is still high, and there were major gaps between ITN ownership and compliance in malarious areas. Additional efforts are needed to target the high transmission area of western Ethiopia to sustain the achievements made to date.

N2  - Oral acute toxicity effects of six agrochemicals; (Malathion 50% EC, Profenofos 72% EC, Karate 5 EC, 2, 4-D, Pallas 45 OD and Mancozeb 80% WP), were evaluated under laboratory condition. All the tested agrochemicals were found to be toxic to the local honeybee race compared to negative control (50% honey solution) administered through oral feeding. Malathion 50% EC and Profenofos 72% EC exhibited fast action, took less than 2 hours after exposure, in imposing death for 100% of the experimental adult honeybees. Karate 5 EC and 2, 4-D took longer time (24 hours) to kill the same percent of the experimental adult honeybees. It is advisable not to apply those products or allow them to drift to blooming crops or weeds while honeybees are actively visiting the treatment area. © 2020 Fundacion CIPAV. All rights reserved.

N2  - A low adoption of recommended seed potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) technologies in Ethiopia could be due to a lack of alternative seed potato production methods compatible with farmers' economic and agro-ecological conditions. A conjoint analysis (a technique used to measure relative contribution of product attributes) was conducted to elicit farmers' opinions on management attributes that they believed to affect yield and quality of potato. The study involved interviewing 324 farmers who grew seed potato in Jeldu and Welmera districts. The results showed that management attributes, such as storage method, hoeing combined with hill size, fertilizer rate (FR) and fungicide application (FA) frequency had larger effect on seed yield and quality than seed source, seed size, sprouting method, tillage frequency, and planting date. In both districts, using diffused light storage (DLS); hoeing twice, combined with big hills; and using recommended FR, combined with two FAs had significant positive effects on yield and quality of seed potato. In both districts, if all farmers switched to the best management attribute levels, potential increases in seed yield would be about two times the actual seed yield produced in 2010. The results suggest that it is possible to design better methods to produce seed potato compared with methods that farmers currently use. Extension personnel could use these results to recommend to farmers those management attributes that are the most important to improve yield and quality of seed potato in Ethiopia.

N2  - Despite the growing concerns about pesticide pollution, a comprehensive global understanding continues to be hampered by a lack of data from less developed countries. Ethiopia, being a typical agricultural country, is one of the top consumers of pesticides in sub-Saharan Africa. This study conducted a nationwide analysis to assess pesticide water pollution and human health risks in Ethiopia based on the available data. Additionally, the study evaluated the effectiveness of the Pesticide Risks in the Tropics for Man, Environment, and Trade (PRIMET) model, which is currently used for pesticide regulatory risk assessment in Ethiopia. The scoring approach was employed to map the site-specific pollution status based on clearly defined individual pesticide concentrations, excluding mixtures (n = 99). The pollution scores varied significantly among sites, with higher scores observed in the Rift Valley region. Acute and chronic health risks were identified for some commonly detected pesticides at their maximum concentrations. Epidemiological studies conducted in Ethiopia also demonstrated that pesticide exposure is associated with acute poisoning, respiratory health problems, neurobehavioral symptoms, and breast cancer. Furthermore, the study found that the existing regulatory framework likely underestimates pesticide risks in 35 % of the cases, raising concerns about the reliability of the PRIMET model in its current version. Overall, the results emphasize the need for increased attention to pesticide regulation and management in Ethiopia and other countries with similar scenarios, including regular monitoring, implementation of residue limits, post-application evaluations, and recalibration of the PRIMET model. This study provides valuable scientific information and insights into pesticide pollution and can serve as a baseline for ensuring agricultural and environmental sustainability.

N2  - Despite the global ban on organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) since the 1970s, their use continues in many developing countries, including Ethiopia, primarily due to the lack of viable alternatives and weak regulations. Nonetheless, the extent of contamination and the resulting environmental and health consequences in these countries remain inadequately understood. To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of reported concentrations (n=398) of OCPs (n=30) in distinct yet interconnected water matrices: water, sediment, and biota in Ethiopia. Our analysis revealed a notable geographical bias, with higher concentrations found in sediments (0.074–1161.2 µg/kg), followed by biota (0.024–1003 µg/kg) and water (0.001–1.85 µg/L). Moreover, DDTs, endosulfan, and hexachlorohexenes (HCHs) were among the most frequently detected OCPs in higher concentrations in Ethiopian waters. The DDT metabolite p,p′-DDE was commonly observed across all three matrices, with concentrations in water birds reaching levels up to 57 and 143,286 times higher than those found in sediment and water, respectively. The findings showed a substantial potential for DDTs and endosulfan to accumulate and biomagnify in Ethiopian waters. Furthermore, it was revealed that the consumption of fish contaminated with DDTs posed both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks while drinking water did not pose significant risks in this regard. Importantly, the issue of OCPs in Ethiopia assumes even greater significance as their concentrations were found to be eight times higher than those of currently used pesticides (CUPs) in Ethiopian waters. Consequently, given the ongoing concerns about OCPs in Ethiopia, there is a need for ongoing monitoring, implementation of sustainable mitigation measures, and strengthening of OCP management systems in the country, as well as in other developing countries with similar settings and practices.

N2  - Ethiopia is one the major exporter of cut flowers in East Africa. However, the sector is blamed for the intensive use of pesticides which leads to exposure of workers. This study aims to investigate the level of pesticides in blood serum of flower farm workers as a predictor to occupational exposure. A cross-sectional laboratory based study was conducted in central Ethiopia among 194 flower farm workers. Blood sample were collected from 100 study participants (50 from farm workers and 50 civil servants as control). Blood-serum separation, extraction, and clean-up was performed following standard analytical methods. Ten organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) (o,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDD, p,p′-DDE, p,p′-DDT, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, endosulfan, dieldrin, methoxychlor, dibutychloridate), and three pyrethroids (cypermethrin, permethrin and deltamethrin) were detected in the serum of the study participants. From the detected pesticides p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDE were observed at high mean concentration (81.5 ± 83.5, and 12.5 ± 6.7 ng/mL),(38.0 ± 31.8 and 6.84 ± 7.4 ng/mL) in the flower farm and controls, respectively. From the Mann–Whitney U-test, there is a significant difference for total DDT (P < 0.02), p,p′-DDE (P < 0.001), cypermethrin (P < 0.001), heptachlor (P < 0.04), heptachlor-epoxide (P < 0.001) and dibutyl chlorendate (P < 0.01) among the flower farm workers and controls. Multinomial regression revealed, being flower farm worker is a significant predictor of moderate to high residues of p,p′-DDE, total DDT, heptachlor-epoxide and dibutyl chlorendate. The pesticides under study were detected more frequently in the flower farm workers than controls which is an indicative for occupational exposure to pesticides and strict regulation is important for the safety of workers.

N2  - Background: The presence of agricultural pesticide residue can cause adverse health effects.The main objective of this study was to evaluate the level of pesticides in the blood of small-scale farmers (SSFs) and associated risk factors in western Ethiopia. Methods: Across sectional study was conducted in June 2020 using 240 blood samples, 140 from the exposed small-scale farmers (ESSFs) and 100 from non-exposed small-scale farmers (NESSFs). The blood sample analysis was mad for 5 organochlorines (OCs) and 3 synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) pesticides by gas-liquid chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) methods. Extraction, and clean up of the samples were made by using standard analytical methods. To define the relationships between the outcomes and explanatory variables, logistic regression models were used. Results: The results shows that p,p’-DDT, heptachlor and deltamethrin were the most frequently detected pesticides with 96.4%, 95%, and 100% in both ESSFs and NESSFs, respectively. The ESSFs blood samples have shown the highest mean concentrations of permethrin and p,p'-DDT(1.26 ± 0.15) and (0.28 ± 0.4) mgL−1, respectively. SSFs under the age of 40 were 21% less likely to be exposed to permethrin than those above the age of 40 (Adjusted Odd Ratio, AOR, 0.21; 95% CI: 0.1-0.44). Male SSFs were 17 times more likely to be exposed to heptachlor than females (AOR, 17.36; 95%CI: 7.34-41.09) and farmers with no formal education were 18 times more likely to be exposed to deltamethrin than those with primary schools and beyond (AOR, 18.1; 95 %CI: 4.53-72.06). Furthermore, SSFs that did not use PPE appropriately were 3.6 and 6.21 times more likely to be exposed to cypermethrin (AOR, 3.6; 95%CI: 1.94-6.54) and p,p'-DDE(AOR, 6.21; 95%CI: 3.38-11.41) blood levels than those who did, respectively. SSFs that perform different activities like eating and drinking (11%), chewing (10%), and diverse activities (8%) were more likely to be exposed to p,p′-DDT than those farmers who didn’t use pesticides. Conclusions: This study identified a high concentration p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, heptachlor, cypermethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin in the blood of small scale farmers. The older age, less education, and farmers with inappropriate PPE use are more likely exposed to pesticides.

N2  - The effects of pesticide use on the respiratory health of agricultural farm workers were studied in 203 farm workers and 131 controls. The farm workers were sprayers, supervisors, technicians, and pest assessors. Pulmonary function was found to be remarkably poor among the non-smoker supervisors, followed by the non-smoker sprayers, as compared with that of the non-smoker controls. The means (SD) of FVC and FEV1 for supervisors and sprayers were 2.88 (0.41), 3.05(0.50) and 2.74(0.38), 2.89(0.54), respectively, p < 0.05. The non-smoker technicians had the most respiratory symptoms, with wheezing and breathlessness being the most frequent (35.7 % in 14 technicians). Farm workers with various job experiences are subject to reduction of pulmonary function and frequent complaints of respiratory symptoms that could possibly lead to chronic respiratory health problems.

N2  - Currently, pesticide production and use are on the rise globally. This trend is certain to continue in the coming decades with residues posing risks to the environment and human health even at low levels. Although various aspects of pesticides and their possible implications have widely been studied, such studies have mostly been carried out in developed countries leaving the rest of the world with little scientific information. We present here the results of a study on the occurrences, concentrations, and ecological risks of 30 pesticide residues (PRs) in water and sediment samples from a tropical freshwater Lake Hawassa in the Ethiopian Rift Valley. A total of 54 composite samples of water and sediment were collected from three sampling sites on three occasions. The samples were prepared by quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) technique, and analyzed using GC-MS at Bless Agri Food Laboratory Service located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The study applied the risk quotient (RQ) method to scrutinize the risks posed to aquatic biota by the detected PRs. The results showed occurrences of 18 and 20 PRs in the water and sediment samples, respectively. The majority, 78 and 75% of the detected PRs in water and sediment samples, respectively represent the organochlorine chemical class. Concentrations of heptachlor epoxide were significantly (p ≤ 0.001) higher than those of the remaining pesticides in both matrices. Of the pesticides detected, 77% were present in water and 83% in sediment samples and pose a serious risk (RQ ≥ 1) to the Lake Hawassa biota. This calls for further research to investigate the risks to human health posed by the PRs. The findings of this study can contribute to the development of global protocols, as they support the concerns raised about the ecological and public health impacts of PRs on a global level.

N2  - Rationale: In the last decade, due to expansion of greenhouses and irrigated farms, the use of pesticides in Ethiopia has increased 6-13-fold leading to potential health risks. Objective: To investigate if occupational exposure to pesticides is associated with respiratory health effects in farmers and farm workers from commercial farming systems. Methods: We performed two cross-sectional surveys comprising different farming systems. In the first survey we studied respiratory symptoms among 1104 subjects of which 601 were occupationally exposed to pesticides (ie, 256 pesticide applicators, 345 re-entry workers) and 503 unexposed individuals. The second survey, carried out 2 years later in the same farming regions, additionally included lung function measurement and comprised a total of 387 study subjects of which 206 were occupationally exposed to pesticides (142 applicators and 64 re-entry workers) and 180 unexposed individuals. Results: We observed increased risks for chronic cough and shortness of breath (OR=3.15, 95% CI 1.56 to 6.36 and OR=6.67, 95% CI 2.60 to 17.58) among the exposed subjects as compared with unexposed individuals in the first survey. These results were corroborated in the second survey where we also observed reductions in FEV1 (140 mL), forced expiratory flow 25%-75% (550 mL/s) and risk of FEV1/FVC ratio <0.8 (OR=4.31, 95% CI 2.11 to 8.81) among pesticide exposed workers. Conclusions These findings indicate an increased risk of adverse respiratory health among workers exposed to pesticides. As those effects occurred in young workers (mean age 27 years) and within a relative short duration of exposure (4 years) implementation of stringent occupational health measures are warranted.

N2  - Background: Pesticide exposure is an important public health concern in Ethiopia, but there is limited information on pesticide intoxications. Residents may have an increased risk of pesticide exposure through proximity of their homes to farms using pesticides. Also the pesticide exposure might be related to employment at these farms. This study investigated the prevalence of acute pesticide intoxications (API) by residence proximity to a nearby flower farm and assessed if intoxications were related to working in these farms or not. Methods: A cross-sectional survey involving 516 persons was conducted. Participants were grouped according to their residence proximity from a large flower farm; living within 5 kilometers and 5-12 kilometers away, respectively. In a structured interview, participants were asked if they had health symptoms within 48 h of pesticide exposure in the past year. Those who had experienced this, and reported two or more typical pesticide intoxication symptoms, were considered as having had API. Chi-square and independent t-tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Confounding variables were adjusted by using binomial regression model. Results: The prevalence of API in the past year among the residents in the study area was 26 %, and it was higher in the population living close to the flower farm (42 %) compared to those living far away (11 %), prevalence ratio (PR) = 3.2, 95 % CI: 2.2-4.8, adjusted for age, gender & education. A subgroup living close to the farm & working there had significantly more API (56 %) than those living close & didn't work there (16 %), adjusted PR = 3.0, 95 % CI: 1.8-4.9. Flower farm workers reported more API (56 %) than those not working in the flower farm (13 %,), adjusted PR = 4.0, 95 % CI: 2.9-5.6. Conclusion: Our study indicates a 26 % prevalence of self-reported symptoms attributable to API. The residents living closer than 5 kilometers to the flower farm reported significantly higher prevalence of self-reported API than those living 5-12 kilometers away. This increased risk of API was associated with work at the flower farm.

N2  - Conventional wisdom holds that Sub-Saharan African farmers use few modern inputs despite the fact that most poverty-reducing agricultural growth in the region is expected to come largely from expanded use of inputs that embody improved technologies, particularly improved seed, fertilizers and other agro-chemicals, machinery, and irrigation. Yet following several years of high food prices, concerted policy efforts to intensify fertilizer and hybrid seed use, and increased public and private investment in agriculture, how low is modern input use in Africa really? This article revisits Africa's agricultural input landscape, exploiting the unique, recently collected, nationally representative, agriculturally intensive, and cross-country comparable Living Standard Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) covering six countries in the region (Ethiopia, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda). Using data from over 22,000 households and 62,000 agricultural plots, we offer ten potentially surprising facts about modern input use in Africa today.

N2  - Objective: To estimate prevalence of acute pesticide poisoning (APP) and its association with neurobehavioural symptoms in Ethiopian pesticide applicators. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional survey among 256 pesticide applicators from small-scale irrigated farms, a large-scale open farm and large-scale greenhouses. APP was ascertained using a modified WHO case definition, and neurobehavioural symptoms were collected with a standardised questionnaire (Q16). Exposure to pesticides was estimated using detailed exposure algorithms specifically developed for Ethiopian farms. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate risk of APP and its association with neurobehavioural symptoms. Results: Overall APP prevalence was 16%. Working as an applicator in greenhouses was strongly associated with APP (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.38 to 6.54). Estimated annual pesticide exposure was also associated with APP (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.20). Longer duration of employment appeared to be negatively associated with APP. Having had an APP was strongly associated with reporting more neurobehavioural symptoms (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.01 to 4.58) independent of cumulative pesticide exposure. Cumulative exposure to pesticides appeared to be associated with neurobehavioural symptoms among applicators without and with APP. Conclusions: We showed a substantial prevalence of APP that differed between farming systems and was strongly associated with neurobehavioural symptoms. Intensity of exposure was also clearly associated with these symptoms. Reduction and control of occupational exposure to pesticides is urgently needed in Ethiopia.

N2  - Water resources have been contaminated by pesticides due to the different activities of human beings. Different studies documented that advanced water treatment systems can eliminate pesticides while conventional and household treatment technologies are not well studied. The main aim of the present study is to determine the effect of conventional and household water treatment technologies on the removal of pesticide residue in drinking water. Water samples were collected from the Gibe River (intake point), from each treatment process, and from the distribution system. To determine the effect of the household water treatment process (solar disinfection and boiling), pesticides were spiked into distilled water and then passed through solar disinfection (SODIS) and boiling. The extraction of samples was conducted by following a low-density-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction procedure. The result of the study revealed that almost all studied pesticides except o´p-DDT were detected in water samples. Most pesticides that were detected in water samples from our study areas exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs), except for p,p’-DDE. The percent reduction of pesticide residue after post-chlorination by conventional water treatment ranges from 11.7% (from 70.83 μg/L to 62.54 μg/L) for p´p-DDD to 97.29% (5510.1μg/L to 149.5μg/L) for Dimethachlor, and the percent reduction of pesticide residue by SODIS and boiling ranges from 2.31% (o´p-DDT) to 54.45% (Cypermethrin) and 27.13% (γ-Chlordane) to 38.9% (p´p-DDE) respectively. This indicates that treatment technologies are important for the reduction of pesticides in water. Since studied pesticides are persistent and the resides were exceed MRL (have a health impact), monitoring of pesticides in treatment plant units is necessary and treatment technology improvement is important to allow further removal of pesticides.

N2  - Despite the presence of a wide variety and number of birds, there is exceedingly little data on organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues in birds inhabiting in Africa. In the present study, concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes, drins, cyclodienes, and hexachlorobenzene were measured in liver, kidney, heart and brain of 4 bird species from the Rift Valley region, Ethiopia. Indoor residual spraying of DDT for malaria vector control, and indiscriminate and illegal use of pesticides underline the relevance of this study. Levels of ΣOCPs ranged from 1.87 to 4586 ng/g wet weight, and the scavenger bird species Leptoptilos crumeniferus had the highest level in liver. In all tissues, contamination profiles of OCPs within the species were similar, with DDTs ≫ other OCPs. Among the DDTs, p,p'-DDE was the most abundant compound and had significantly a higher burden in all tissues. The risk characterization demonstrated potential risks to the studied birds associated with DDE exposure. Maximum hepatic levels of p,p'-DDE exceeded the levels reported to trigger adverse effects. The detection of p,p'-DDT in all bird tissues suggests the release of fresh DDT to the environment. This is the first study to assay OCPs in different tissues of birds from the Ethiopian Rift Valley region, and henceforth the data will serve as a reference data for future studies.

N2  - Infants in Ethiopia are consuming food items such as maize as a complementary diet. However, this may expose infants to toxic contaminants like DDT. Maize samples were collected from the households visited during a consumption survey and from markets in Jimma zone, southwestern Ethiopia. The residues of total DDT and its metabolites were analyzed using the Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) method combined with dispersive solid phase extraction cleanup (d-SPE). Deterministic and probabilistic methods of analysis were applied to determine the consumer exposure of infants to total DDT. The results from the exposure assessment were compared with the health based guidance value in this case the provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI). All maize samples (n. =. 127) were contaminated by DDT, with a mean concentration of 1.770. mg/kg, which was far above the maximum residue limit (MRL). The mean and 97.5 percentile (P 97.5) estimated daily intake of total DDT for consumers were respectively 0.011 and 0.309. mg/kg. bw/day for deterministic and 0.011 and 0.083. mg/kg. bw/day for probabilistic exposure assessment. For total infant population (consumers and non-consumers), the 97.5 percentile estimated daily intake were 0.265 and 0.032. mg/kg. bw/day from the deterministic and probabilistic exposure assessments, respectively. Health risk estimation revealed that, the mean and 97.5 percentile for consumers, and 97.5 percentile estimated daily intake of total DDT for total population were above the PTDI. Therefore, in Ethiopia, the use of maize as complementary food for infants may pose a health risk due to DDT residue.

N2  - Ethiopia is a predominantly agrarian country where about 85% of the country&rsquo;s population is engaged in the agricultural sector. The sector has enjoyed substantial growth during the last two decades. To increasing crop production and productivity to achieve high agricultural growth and alleviate food security problems in the growing population through, for example, intensive use of agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides are priorities for the Ethiopian government. As a result of this agricultural intensification policy of the Ethiopian government, the use of pesticides and fertilizers has increased year to year and will be expected to further increase in the years to come. The central Ethiopian rift valley region, particularly in the vicinity of Lake Ziway, is amongst the regions where agrochemicals (pesticides and fertilizers) are most intensively used by smallholder farmers producing vegetables and fruits (e.g., tomato, onion, cabbage, green bean and pepper) and by large-scale farms producing horticulture crops (e.g., cut-flowers and grape). Residual concentrations of pesticides and nutrients used by the small- and large-scale farmers may enter Lake Ziway through several routes such as agricultural land runoff, effluent discharge, drift during spraying, and inadequate handling of remnant pesticides and empty pesticide containers. Currently, there is high concern about the pollution of Lake Ziway by residuals of agrochemicals (e.g., pesticide) and their ecological effects. In addition, Lake Ziway is under threat of pollution by urban wastes (solid and liquid wastes) sourced from the fast-growing Batu and Meki towns found at the south-west and north-west side of the lake, respectively. Therefore, a systemic investigation that assesses the ecological impacts of pollutants to Lake Ziway (e.g., pesticides, trace metals and microplastics, and nutrients) due to agricultural and urbanization in the catchment area of the lake is needed to support its conservation and protection. The main objectives of our studies were; 1) to review the status, temporal and spatial variability of water quality and biological resources of Lake Ziway, 2) to assess the goods and services that local communities currently derive from the lake, 3) to investigate the current use and misuse of pesticides by small- and large-scale farmers in the vicinity of Lake Ziway, monitor pesticide concentrations in lake sediment and water compartments, and evaluate the associa…

N2  - In most developing countries, including Ethiopia, a conspicuous gap exists in understanding risk of pesticides and establishing robust regulatory frameworks for their effective management. In this context, we present a detailed assessment of pesticide risks within Ethiopian aquatic ecosystems in at least 18 distinct surface water bodies, including 46 unique sample locations. Measured environmental concentrations (MECs; n = 388) of current-use pesticides (n = 52), sourced from existing field studies, were compared against their respective regulatory threshold levels (RTLs). The results indicated a scarcity of pesticide exposure data across the majority of Ethiopian water bodies situated within agricultural watersheds. Importantly, surface water pesticide concentrations ranged from 0.0001 to 142.66 μg/L, with a median concentration of 0.415 μg/L. The available dataset revealed that 142 out of 356 MECs (approximately 40 %) of the identified pesticides entail significant acute risks to aquatic ecosystems, with the highest RTL exceedances up to a factor of 8695. Among the pesticide use groups, insecticides exhibited the highest exceedance rate, while this was rarer for fungicides and herbicides. Furthermore, a species-specific insecticide risk assessment indicated aquatic invertebrates (54.4 %) and fishes (38.4 %) are more exposed to pesticide risks, attributable to pyrethroids and organophosphates. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that the presently registered pesticides in Ethiopia carry elevated risks towards aquatic environments under real-world settings. This challenges the notion that pesticides approved through Ethiopian pesticide regulatory risk assessment entail minimal environmental hazards. Consequently, we advocate for the adoption of more refined risk assessment strategies, a post-registration reevaluation process, and, if deemed necessary, the imposition of bans or restrictions on highly toxic pesticides.

N2  -  Over the years, the chemical market has shown significant growth, but the hazardous impact of chemical use and disposal on the environment and human health is a growing concern. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are among the most dangerous chemicals with widespread effects on the environment and living organisms, including humans. This study aimed to assess the current status of POP management and regulatory infrastructure in Ethiopia by collecting information from stakeholders responsible for recording the import, export, use, management, and regulation of POPs both in government and private sectors. Additionally, a comprehensive literature review was conducted using Boolean operators from international databases and libraries. The results indicated that Ethiopia banned the import of pesticides listed under Annex A (i.e., those to be eliminated), except endosulfan, which was imported at a quantity of 199,767 kg lt -1 from 2011 to 2015. There are 2,435 PCB-containing transformers in Ethiopia, of which 2,242 (92%) are currently in use. These transformers and capacitors contain 1,031,661 kg and 1,255 kg of dielectric fluids, respectively. As for Annex B POPs (i.e., those to be restricted), there are between 928,509 kg and 1,383,095 kg of active and obsolete dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane found in different stores across the country. Ethiopia imported approximately 337,000 kg of products containing perfluorooctane sulfonic acid from 2000 to 2020, with an annual average of 16,850 kg of photographic film, paper, and plates. POPs were also detected in different environmental matrices (soil, waterbodies, sediments, food items, and air) as well as human blood. Despite these findings, regulation and management of POP waste and stockpiles are largely inadequate in Ethiopia. Therefore, it is crucial to improve the monitoring, management, and regulation of POPs in the country. This could be achieved by strengthening the collaboration among different regulatory bodies, harmonizing the fragmented laws on POP management and control, and building institutional capacity.

N2  - The aims of the present study were to present a methodology for toxicity tests that can be used when analytical resources to verify the test concentrations are limited, and to evaluate whether the sensitivity of a limited number of Ethiopian species to pesticides differs from literature values for, mainly, temperate species. Acute toxicity tests were performed using three Ethiopian aquatic invertebrate species, one crustacean (Diaphanosoma brachyurum) and two insects (Anopheles pharoensis and Culex pipiens) and using the pesticides endosulfan and diazinon. All species–pesticide combinations were tested in duplicate to estimate the consistency, i.e. the intra-laboratory variation, in test results. Daphnia magna was tested as well to allow the test results to be compared directly with values from the literature. Results indicate that the differences between the EC50s obtained for D. magna in this study and those reported in the literature were less than a factor of 2. This indicates that the methodology used is able to provide credible toxicity values. The results of the duplicated tests showed intra-laboratory variation in EC50 values of up to a factor of 3, with one test showing a difference of a factor of 6 at 48 h. Comparison with available literature results for arthropod species using species sensitivity distributions indicated that the test results obtained in this study fit well in the log-normal distribution of the literature values. We conclude that the methodology of performing multiple tests to check for consistency of test results and performing tests with D. magna for comparison with literature values to check for accuracy is able to provide reliable effect threshold levels and that the tested Ethiopian species did not differ in sensitivity from the arthropod species reported on in the literature.

N2  - Coffee is a highly consumed and popular beverage all over the world; however, coffee beans used for daily consumption may contain pesticide residues that may cause adverse health effects to consumers. In this monitoring study, the effect of household coffee processing on pesticide residues in coffee beans was investigated. Twelve pesticides, including metabolites and isomers (endosulfan α, endosulfan β, cypermethrin, permethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene, p′p-DDE, p′p-DDD, o′p-DDT, and p′p-DDT) were spiked in coffee beans collected from a local market in southwestern Ethiopia. The subsequent household coffee processing conditions (washing, roasting, and brewing) were established as closely as possible to the traditional household coffee processing in Ethiopia. Washing of coffee beans showed 14.63'57.69 percent reduction, while the roasting process reduced up to 99.8 percent. Chlorpyrifos ethyl, permethrin, cypermethrin, endosulfan α and β in roasting and all of the 12 pesticides in the coffee brewing processes were not detected. Kruskal-Wallis analysis indicated that the reduction of pesticide residues by washing is significantly different from roasting and brewing (P < 0.0001). However, there was no significant difference between coffee roasting and brewing (P > 0.05). The processing factor (PF) was less than one (PF < 1), which indicates reduction of pesticides under study during processing of the coffee beans. The cumulative effect of the three processing methods has a paramount importance in evaluating the risks associated with ingestion of pesticide residues, particularly in coffee beans.

N2  - A study was conducted to assess the knowledge and practices of Ethiopian farmers about pesticide management: implications for human health. A pretested standardized questionnaire was administered. The results revealed that the great majority 174 (99.4%) farmers had ample awareness about pesticide impact on human health. However, various hazardous practices have also been documented. One hundred thirty-five (77.2%) farmers make use of the empty pesticide containers for various household purposes. The most frequent self-reported toxicity symptoms associated with pesticide use were headache (58.8%), salivation and vomiting (38.2%), nausea (36.5%), and sneezing (12.5%). Chi-square analysis revealed a strong association between the farmer's educational status and reported toxicity symptoms (p=.0001; ?2=498.2; df =30). Creating awareness about safe usage of pesticide is extremely vital by special orientation programs. Besides, promoting alternative pest control strategies such as use of biopesticides and integrated pestmanagement (IPM) could be productive. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - ABSTRACT. In this study, the residual concentrations of some organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides were determined in tomato, potato, and pineapple samples from selected farmlands of Jimma and Kefa Zones, Southwest of Ethiopia. The QuEChERS procedure, AOAC-2007, was used for extraction of the pesticides from the samples prior to their determinations by a gas GC-ECD. Pesticides including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, endrin, and dieldrin were not detected in all studied samples. Dimethoate was detected only in Mana and Saka Buyo Qacama tomato samples. Likewise, malathion was detected only in the Saka Buyo Qacama tomato sample. The residual concentrations of most of the studied pesticides were below their MRLs set in EU guideline. However, the recorded residual concentrations of dibutyl chlorendate and chloroflurenol-methyl pesticides were above the EU general default MRL. The percent recoveries studied by spiking known concentrations of the analytes ranged from 71.22–121.56%. However, the recoveries of chloroflurenol-methyl and chlorpyrifos in the potato sample were 65.65 and 67.90%, respectively. One-way ANOVA results (p ≤ 0.05) indicated the presence of significant variations in the concentrations of the detected pesticides among the sampling sites. Generally, the findings showed that regular monitoring of pesticide residues in agricultural products of the area is needed.   KEY WORDS: Organophosphates and organochlorines pesticides, QuEChERS, Tomato, potato, and pineapple samples, GC-ECD   Bull.

N2  - Objective: To characterise acute poisonings in pregnant and non-pregnant women treated at emergency departments of government hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, between 2010 and 2015. Methods: All data for acutely poisoned women were retrospectively collected from patient medical charts at the emergency departments of Saint Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College, Ras Desta Memorial Hospital, Yekatit 12 Hospital Medical College and Zewditu Memorial Hospital. Data were collected by extraction questionnaire and analysed using SPSSv. 20 statistical software. Results: During the study period, 998 cases of acutely poisoned women were listed in the hospital registries. Of these, complete data for inclusion in the study were available for 592. 36.3% of the study participants were in the age group of 20–24, with a mean (±SD) age of 23.03 (±6.3) years. 80.9% were from Addis Ababa; 4.6% were pregnant. The mean arrival time of all cases was 4.14 h. 85.5% of all study cases were due to intentional self-poisoning, of whom 42.1% were discharged without complications. The most common poisons were bleach and organophosphates; 25.9% of pregnant cases and 32.6% of non-pregnant cases were poisoned by bleach; and 18.5% of pregnant cases and 18.9% of non-pregnant cases had organophosphate poisoning. 0.7% had a history of poisoning; all were non-pregnant women. The common route of poison exposure was oral, and the case fatality rate of organophosphate poisoning in pregnant and non-pregnant women was 20 and 1.87%, respectively. The pre-hospital intervention for the majority of the women was milk, in 12.0% of cases. Conclusion: Acute poisoning remains a public health problem in our community. Bleach is the most common poisons. Our present findings indicate the necessity of educational programmes on preventable reasons of acute poisonings and their outcomes on pregnant and non-pregnant women.

N2  - Background: Pesticide use in Ethiopia has become a common practice in which large-scale flower farms are the main consumers. Workers on flower farms might be exposed to pesticides while spraying or while performing other tasks related to pesticide use and management. It is unclear whether working as a flower farm sprayer is associated with respiratory health problems. Objective: The objective of this study was to compare respiratory symptoms and lung function indices between pesticide sprayers and non-spraying workers. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 15 flower farms, involving all-male sprayers as the pesticide-exposed group and all other male workers as a control group. Data were collected using a standard questionnaire for respiratory symptoms developed by the British Medical Research Council and the American Thoracic Society. Lung function tests were performed to determine forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1), mid 50 expiratory flow, and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC. Chi-squared tests and Poisson regression analyses were used to compare respiratory symptoms between the two working groups. General linear regression models were used to compare lung function test indices between spraying and non-spraying working groups. The significance level was set to 0.05. Results: A total of 285 male workers participated (152 sprayers and 133 non-spraying workers). The mean age of the workers was 25 years for sprayers and 24 years for non-sprayers. The proportions of cough, cough with sputum, breathlessness, and wheezing were similar in the two groups, while chest tightness was significantly high in the non-spraying group. Sprayers had significantly higher FVC and FEV1 than the non-spraying group. Conclusions: Respiratory symptoms were not different between the sprayers and non-spraying workers except that the non-spraying workers had increased chest tightness. FVC and FEV1 were significantly higher among sprayers relative to non-sprayers. The results must be interpreted with caution, as the sprayers used respiratory protective equipment, which probably reduced their exposure to the pesticides. Also, the workers were young, and a healthy worker effect might be present among the sprayers.

N2  - The Maresha, the traditional Ethiopian plow, requires repeated cross-plowing which causes increased surface runoff, less infiltration and hence lower water availability to crops. The main reasons for increased surface runoff and reduced infiltration are plowing along the slope and the formation of a plow pan at shallow depths. Conservation tillage is seen as a way to alleviate these problems. The widely advocated zero-tillage, however, is not feasible for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions of Ethiopia because of difficulties in maintaining adequate soil cover, the practice of communal grazing, and high costs of herbicides. Strip tillage systems, on the other hand, may offer a solution. This study was initiated to test strip tillage systems and to evaluate the impacts of new tillage systems on the water balance and grain yields of maize. Experiments have been conducted in a semi-arid area called Melkawoba in the central Rift Valley of Ethiopia during 2003-2005. Strip tillage systems involved cultivation along planting lines at a spacing of 0.75m using the Maresha plow followed by subsoiling along the same lines (STS) or without subsoiling (ST). Results have been compared with traditional tillage involving 3-4 overpasses with the Maresha plow (CONV). Soil moisture has been monitored to a depth of 1.8m using a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) while surface runoff has been measured using a specially designed rectangular trough installed at the bottom of each plot. STS resulted in the least surface runoff (Q s=18mmseason -1) and the highest grain yields (Y=2130kgha -1) followed by ST (Q s=26mmseason -1, Y=1840kgha -1) and CONV (Qs=43mmseason -1, Y=1720kgha -1) provided sowing was carried out within a week after subsoiling. Thus, STS resulted in the highest water productivity, W P=0.60kgm -3, followed by ST (W P=0.52kgm -3) and CONV (W P=0.48kgm -3). The main conclusion of the paper is that even in dry areas reasonable yields can be obtained provided moisture conservation in the root zone is guaranteed. In this regard subsoiling is essential. Moreover, it is concluded that the time between subsoiling and planting is a key factor and should not exceed one week. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The liquid membrane extraction method has been employed for selectively extracting trace quantities of s-triazine herbicides in environmental waters collected from lakes Awassa, Chamo and Abbya, located in close proximity to the agricultural farms in Southern Ethiopia. In liquid membrane extraction, the uncharged triazine compounds from the flowing donor solution diffuse through a porous poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) membrane, containing a water immiscible organic solvent. The s-triazine molecules are then irreversibly trapped in the stagnant acidic acceptor phase since they become protonated. Using both di-n-hexylether and n-undecane membrane solvents, s-traizine herbicides were extracted and low detection limits of about 1 ng/L have been obtained by extraction of three liters of sample solution spiked with 0.1 μg/L of each triazine. Residues of atrazine and terbutryn ranging in concentration from 0.02 to 0.05 μg/L have been successfully determined.

N2  - Breast milk is often used as an environmental bioindicator since it serves as an important medium to accumulate organochlorine pesticides. The main aim of this study is to determine the level of organochlorine pesticides in human breast milk collected from three districts of southwestern Ethiopia (Asendabo, Deneba, and Serbo) at three times points baselines (1st month), midline (six months), and end line (12 months) and risk of infants’ exposure. A longitudinal study was conducted to assess pesticide residues in human breast milk samples and evaluate the risk-exposure of infants to these pesticides from consumption of mother’s milk in Ethiopia. Breast milk samples were collected from 168 mothers at three time points and pesticides were extracted using the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method. The level of pesticide residues in human milk samples and exposure of infants to the pesticides was evaluated by calculating the estimated daily intake and compared with the provisional tolerable daily intake of the pesticides under study. The results indicated that, from the eight organochlorine pesticides analyzed in 447 breast milk samples at three sampling times, DDT and its metabolites were detected. p,p′-DDE and p,p′-DDT were detected in all (100%) of the breast milk samples while, p,p-DDD, and o,p-DDT were detected in 53.9%, and 42.7%, respectively. The mean concentration of total DDT at three time points(baseline, midline and endline) were 2.25, 1.68 and 1.32 µg/g milk fat, respectively. The mean concentration of total DDT from the three districts was 1.85 µg/g milk fat which is above the maximum residue limit (MRL = 0.02 µg/g milk fat set by FAO/WHO). The mean ratio of DDT/DDE for the three areas was calculated less than five (< 5) indicates historical DDT use in the study area. The estimated daily intake of infants at the first month of breastfeeding was 11.24 µg/kg-BW/day, above the provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) for total DDT set by FAO/WHO, which is 10 µg/kg body weight. An intake of OCPs is a big concern for infants' health in Ethiopia and countries with a similar condition, particularly at the first month of lactation. Strict regulations of the health-threatening pesticide by the regulatory body (Environment, Forest and Climate Change Commission) at the country and regional levels is advocated.

N2  - Background: Occupational skin diseases are the second leading occupational disease, accounting for almost 25% of all missed workdays. Occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) accounts for 70% to 90% of all skin disorders in the workplace. Only a few occupational epidemiology studies have looked into the prevalence and risk factors of occupation-induced dermatitis among narcotic crop farm workers around the world. Related studies in Ethiopia are even fewer. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Dirashe district of Southern Ethiopia from March 23 to April 12, 2021. Data was collected using a standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire. The history of contact dermatitis was determined using the standardized Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire version 2002 (NOSQ-2002). A total of 578 farm laborers took part in the study, which was conducted using a systematic random sampling. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression were used to characterize the data and identify factors associated with occupational contact dermatitis. Result: The prevalence of self-reported occupational contact dermatitis in the past 12 months among workers of large-scale Khat farms was (AOR: 67.80%, 95% CI [61.00, 76.23]). In the multivariable regression, being older (AOR: 5.51, 95% CI [1.79, 7.24]), working as a bundle binder (AOR: 5.74, 95% CI [2.12, 15.55]), not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) (AOR: 2.50, 95% CI [1.64, 3.81]), and having poor knowledge of pesticides use, storage, and disposal methods (AOR: 2.50, 95% CI [1.64, 3.81]) were associated with occupational contact dermatitis. Conclusion: Contact dermatitis caused by work is very common among Khat farm laborers. Measures to promote safe practices and reduce exposure to hazards, such as removing expired and/or banned chemicals, purchasing alternative pesticides that meet legislative requirements, job rotation and routine training of staff on safe practices, increasing safety signage, and performing risk assessments, as well as improving the quantity and quality of institutional protective equipment supplies may thus contribute to the enhancement of safe work practices.

The total concentration of analyzed compounds ranged from 126.72 ng kg-1 d.w. in a large agricultural reservoir represented by the Koka Reservoir (KR) to 11351.30 ng kg-1 d.w. in the small, urban pond represented by Pabianka Reservoir (PR). Concentration measured as WHO-TEQ ranged from 1.73 ng TEQ kg-1 d.w. in a large agricultural Sulejów Reservoir (SR) to 211.95 ng TEQ kg-1 d.w. in a small industrial pond situated below a textile factory (TF). Obtained results, in reference to size and main human impact on reservoirs, showed that the smallest reservoir Pabianka Reservoir (PR) situated in a highly urbanized catchment and textile factory pond (TF) with a high impact of industrial effluents had the highest potential for PCDDs, PCDFs and dl-PCBs accumulation. © by PSP.

N2  - ABSTRACTS: Maize is one of Ethiopia’s most important and strategic staple food security crops, grown by smallholder farmers. However, Maize production has not reached maximum potential due to a number of constraints, including storage insect pests, resulting in both qualitative and quantitative losses. The aim of this research was to assess farmers’ perceptions and understanding of major maize grain storage insect pests, investigate farmers’ current pest management activities, and identify pest management challenges as well as key intervention areas in the development of IPM strategies for maize grain storage pests. From February to April 2018, a survey was conducted in Ethiopia’s Ambo and Tokke kuttayye districts of the West Showa Administrative Zone. Face-to-face interviews with 146 randomly selected farmer household respondents were conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire. A large percentage of the farmers interviewed in both districts grew hybrid maize varieties. The majority of farmers (65.7%) packed their maize grain in polypropylene bags. Traditional storage facilities were used by just around a quarter of them. The majority of farmers kept their maize grain shelled, while a small percentage kept it unshelled. Most of the respondents knew about storage insect pests and reported that in the storage, their maize grains were attacked by a variety of insect pests, causing estimated damage of 26–50%, among which, Maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky) and Angoumois grain moth (Sitotroga cerealella Olivier) were the most common ones. Age and storage form had a positive and statistically significant impact on farmers’ perception of severe insect pest attack on stored maize. Respondents used a number of control approaches, the most common of which was the use of synthetic pesticides. While, traditional control methods were only used rarely. In general, the results highlighted the importance of combining resistant varieties, pesticidal plants, and cultural pest management methods to establish effective IPM approaches, as well as addressing the challenges that prevent the use of modern storage technologies and control methods.

N2  - The current and expected growth of the world’s population warrants an increased production of high-quality animal protein. Dairy farming is regarded as one of the important ways of satisfying this need to meet the growing demand for milk, especially in developing countries. The focus on crossbreeding and increasing the productivity of dairy cattle has, besides enhanced milk production, also resulted in an increased use of agro-­chemicals, mainly antibiotics and anti-parasite drugs. The residues of these agro-chemicals, if not managed properly, could leak into the environment, affecting natural processes, biodiversity, and soil life. Public health can also be affected due to residues in milk and meat, especially in countries with insufficient food quality controls. These processes contribute to the growing global threat to human and animal health posed by multi-resistant microbes. This article discusses the differences and similarities of dairy farming, and the effect on public and environmental health, between the Netherlands, India, Ethiopia, and Uganda, emphasizing the strategies that have been developed during the E-Motive exchange project to reduce the use of antibiotics and other chemicals in dairy farming. Proposed solutions include raising consciousness about the risk of antibiotics and their effect on food quality, and implementing the Natural Livestock Farming five-layer approach for reducing the use of antibiotics and other chemicals. This approach is based on improving animal and farm management, revitalizing ethno veterinary knowledge and the use of medicinal plants, genetic improvement through strategic use of local breeds, establishing quality control systems in the dairy chain, and extra payment to farmers for residue-free milk.

N2  - Intensive pesticide use increased concern about the potential acute and chronic health effects of pesticides in general and among applicators in particular. This study aims to explore occupational and environmental pesticide exposure and health risks among pesticide applicators and residents. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1,073 individuals. We examined the health effects potentially attributable to pesticide exposure using regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PR). A higher proportion of good knowledge of pesticides [75 vs. 14%; APR = 1.542 (1.358–1.752), p < 0.001] and a higher mean score of perceived health risk of pesticide use [4.21 vs. 3.90; APR = 1.079 (1.004–1.159), p < 0.05] were observed among applicators than residents. A significantly higher proportion of applicators experienced health effects presumably related to pesticide exposure among themselves (36%) than residents (16%), and a higher proportion of them used prescribed drugs in the past 12 months [51 vs. 32%; APR = 1.140 (1.003–1.295), p < 0.05]. Skin irritation, shortness of breath, cough, and dizziness were more likely reported by applicators than residents. Perceived toxicity of currently applied pesticide products, mix pesticides without gloves, regularly maintain and wash sprayer tank after application, occurrence of an incidental splash during mixing and application, and using home-based care after experiencing a symptom presumably due to pesticide exposure were significantly associated with health effects among applicators. Use of face mask and visiting health facility when experiencing a symptom presumably due to pesticide exposure were significantly positively correlated with attending training on the health risks and use of pesticides. A substantial proportion of applicators reported improper use of preventive measures and methods of pesticide waste disposal. These observations point out that applicators can face high health risks of occupational pesticide exposure in Ethiopia. Even trained applicators pursued poor preventive practices; hence, comprehensive practice-oriented in-depth training focusing on safety precautions and proper use of personal protective equipment, and provision of adequate pesticide waste disposal means are crucial interventions.

N2  - Developing countries like Ethiopia are grabbling with rapid population growth, urbanization, agricultural intensification, and climate change which put intense pressure on the availability and quality of water resources. The surface water quality degradation is exacerbating due to increasing urbanization and agricultural activities. The average annual fertilizer use in Ethiopia increased from 132,522 metric tons (mt) in 1996 to 858,825 mt in 2015. Pesticide use also increases significantly from 3,327.7 mt/y in 2006 to 4,211.5 mt/y in 2010. The Awash river is one of the most affected rivers by intensified irrigation schemes, industrial, and urbanization pollution. The Awash river and its tributaries are used for domestic, irrigation, industrial, and recreational purposes. However, as per Canadian water quality indices for the drinking and irrigation water quality, the upper Awash basin scored 34.79, and 46.39, respectively, in the poor and marginal categories; whereas the middle/lower basin indicated 32.25 and 62.78 in poor and marginal ranges, respectively. Dissolved phosphorous in the headwater tributaries is about 0.51 mg/l which is beyond the threshold (0.15 mg/l). The surface water quality impairment is severe in the upper Awash basin where more than 90% of Addis Ababa's industries discharge their waste into nearby waterways without treatment; about 30% of the population lacks access to a liquid waste disposal and treatment facility; only 16% of the population is connected to sewage system, and 25% of the total waste generated enters freshwater systems without treatment. Many studies on surface water quality are reviewed and many of them are inconclusive for a number of reasons. For example, no comprehensive surface water quality research, lack of detailed combined spatial and temporal surface water quality data, and analysis to show the overall picture of the basin are a few of them. Despite the existence of the policy and legal tools, enforcement is lacking. Improving the ecological health of rivers necessitates policy revision as well as increased knowledge and engagement among implementers.

N2  - The present study investigated the bioaccumulation of organochlorines in two milk-producing animals (goats and cows) grazed on the same feed to explore the extent of organochlorines availability in milk and any species effect on the bioaccumulation pattern. Six organochlorine pesticides: aldrin, α-endosulfan, β-endosulfan, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDT were determined in samples collected from four regions in Ethiopia. Aldrin (11.6μgkg-1) was detected only in one cow milk sample and α-endosulfan was detected in one goat milk sample at a level of 142.1μgkg-1, and in one cow milk sample (47.8μgkg-1) from the same region. p,p'-DDE was detected in 40% of the milk samples analyzed while o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDT were found in high amounts in almost all samples. The average total DDT (excluding DDD) in the samples was 328.5μgkg-1. Regions known for their malaria epidemics were the most contaminated with DDT residue. The accumulation pattern in both species was not clear under natural sampling. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - The tomato had nutritional, economic and health benefits to the societies, however, its production and productivity were low in developing countries and particularly in Ethiopia. This might be due to technical inefficiency caused by institutional, governmental, and farmers related factors. Therefore this study tried to investigate the factors that affecting technical efficiency and estimating the mean level of technical efficiency of tomato producers in Asaita district, Afar Regional State, Ethiopia. Both primary and secondary data sources were used; the primary data was collected from 267 tomato producers from the study area cross-sectional by using a multistage sampling technique. The single-stage stochastic frontier model and Cobb Douglas production function were applied and statistical significance was declared at 0.05. The maximum likelihood estimates of the stochastic frontier model showed that land, labor, tomato seed, and oxen have a significant effect on tomato output; and education, extension contact, training, and access to credit have a positive and significant effect on technical efficiency, whereas household size, off-farm income, livestock ownership, distance to market, and pesticides have a worthy and significant effect on technical efficiency; and also estimated mean technical efficiency of tomato producer in a study area was 80.9%. In a line with this, the responsible body should prioritize rural infrastructure development in areas such as education, marketplace, and farmer training centers; demonstrate access to credit and extension services; use the recommended amount of pesticides per hectare, and give more intension to mixed farming rather than animal husbandry exclusively.

N2  - Introduction Neural tube defects affect the brain and the spinal cord of the developing embryo. The defects occur due to incomplete or failure of closure of the neural tube. The condition eventually causes death and lifelong disability. Worldwide, more than 300,000 babies are born with neural tube defects each year. The highest burden is in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, this study aims to identify the risk factors associated with neural tube defects among mothers who gave birth in North Shoa Zone Hospitals. Methods A hospital based unmatched case-control study was conducted among 243 (81 cases and 162 controls) study participants in North Shoa Zone Hospitals. The hospitals were selected using simple random sampling and all cases and randomly selected controls in the selected hospitals were included in the study. The data were collected by using pre-tested structured questionnaire. Results Different factors were identified to have association with neural tube defect. Family annual cash income less than 24000ETB (AOR: 3.73, 95%CI: 1.35, 10.26), history of still birth (AOR: 3.63, 95%CI: 1.03, 12.2), history of abortion (AOR: 6.15, 95%CI: 2.63, 18.56), preconception tea use (AOR: 2.36, 95%CI: 1.15, 4.86) and pesticides/chemical exposure (AOR: 5.34, 95%CI: 1.77, 16.05) were positively associated factors. In contrast, preconception care (AOR: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.05, 0.39) and taking iron/folic acid/multivitamin during the current pregnancy (AOR: 0.16, 95%CI: 0.07, 0.33) showed a protective effect. Conclusion Family annual income less than 24000ETB, history of still birth, history of abortion, preconception tea uses and pesticides/chemical exposure were associated factors of neural tube defects. Preconception counseling and screening should be recommended for women who plan for pregnancy.

N2  - Fish consumption is known to have several health benefits for humans. However, the accumulation of organic pollutants, like organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) could pose health hazards. Thus, OCPs in edible fish species (Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zillii, Carassius spp., and Clarias gariepinus) from Lake Ziway, an Ethiopian Rift Valley Lake were investigated to assess the potential human health hazards of these contaminants. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), chlordanes, and heptachlors were observed with σOCPs concentration ranging from 1.41 to 63.8ngg-1 ww. DDTs were the predominant contaminants (0.9 to 61.9ngg-1 ww), followed by HCHs. The predominance of DDTs may be attributed to their current use in vector control and contamination from past usage. The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of OCPs from all fish species were much lower than the acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), indicating that consumption of fish is at little risk to human health at present. However, the cancer risk estimates in the area of concern and the hazard ratios (HRs) of HCHs, DDTs, and heptachlors exceeded the threshold value of one, indicating daily exposure to these compounds is a potential concern. This may result in a lifetime cancer risk greater than of 1 in 106. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of imidacloprid on structural (invertebrates and primary producers) and functional (organic matter decomposition and physicochemical parameters) characteristics of tropical freshwaters using acute single species and mesocosm studies performed in Ethiopia. The recovery of affected endpoints was also studied by using a mesocosm study period of 21 weeks. Our acute toxicity test showed that Cloeon dipterum (96-h EC50 = 1.5 μg/L) and Caenis horaria (96-h EC50 = 1.9 μg/L) are relatively sensitive arthropods to imidacloprid. The mesocosm experiment evaluated the effects of four applications of imidacloprid with a weekly interval and the results showed that the macroinvertebrate and zooplankton community structure changed significantly due to imidacloprid contamination in mesocosms repeatedly dosed with ≥0.1 and ≥ 0.01 μg/L, respectively (time weighted average concentrations of 112 days (TWA112d) of ≥0.124 and ≥ ≈0.02 μg/L, respectively). The largest responses were found for C. dipterum, C. horaria, Brachionus sp. and Filinia sp. Chlorophyll-a concentrations of periphyton and phytoplankton significantly increased in the ≥0.1 μg/L treatments levels which are indirect effects as a result of the release of grazing pressure. A significant, but quantitatively small, decrease of organic matter decomposition rate was observed in mesocosms treated with repeated doses of 1 μg/L (TWA112d of 2.09 μg/L). No recovery was observed for the macroinvertebrates community during the study period of 21 weeks, but zooplankton recovered after 9 weeks. We observed spatio-temporal related toxicity differences between tropical and temperate aquatic taxa, with tropical taxa generally being more sensitive. This suggests that use of temperate toxicity data for the risk assessment of imidacloprid in tropical region is not recommended.

N2  - Patterns in pesticide practice were studied among smallholder farmers in Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana and Senegal, growing cotton, vegetables, pineapple, cowpea, and mixed cereals and legumes, for export and local markets. Quantitative and qualitative methods were used to examine pesticide use and handling, costs and access and health, welfare and sustainability issues. Drivers encouraging pesticides as the dominant form of pest management include food staple varieties highly susceptible to insect attack; increased pest incidence; lack of advice on alternative methods; a growing informal market in 'discount' and often unauthorised pesticides; subsidy; and poor attention to the economics of pest control. The paper contrasts the situation of food crops for African consumers with the increasing attention to food safety and pesticide restrictions in export horticulture to Europe and the growing demand for organic cotton, and discusses challenges for implementation of IPM and safer practice. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - In this study, the levels of DDT and its metabolite residues were determined in chewable parts of Catha edulis plants grown in the southern part of Ethiopia. The levels of p,p′-DDT and p,p′-DDE were found to be in the range of 10.8-19.7 and 3.5-18.6 μg/kg, respectively. These data revealed that the residue being detected is from recent applications. The estimated daily intake of total DDT from C. edulis consumption was calculated to be in the range between 0.0278 and 0.0747 μg/kg, which is significantly lower than the FAO/WHO guideline. However, this may not guarantee safety, as the application of DDT extends to vegetables as well. Even though the use of DDT was banned in Ethiopia for agriculture purposes, detectable levels are still being observed. The results of the study necessitate the need for awareness creation among the people in the community.

N2  - Pesticide registration in developing countries like Ethiopia is often not supported by substantiated risk assessment procedures. In this study, we evaluated the PRIMET (Pesticide Risks in the Tropics for Man, Environment and Trade) Registration_Ethiopia_1.1 model which is a tool developed to assess the risks to non-target protection goals. All the 103 registered active ingredients (a.i.) in Ethiopia, except those used for flower and storage pest control purposes, were evaluated on their environmental risks. Data on physico-chemical characteristics, toxicity and pesticide use patterns were mined from either the information given in the dossier or public databases. Together with scenarios specifically developed for Ethiopia, these data were used to perform a risk assessment for the aquatic and terrestrial environment as well as for vertebrates including humans via contaminated drinking water exposure. Results indicated that 11 and 16% of the a.i.s are indicated to pose high acute risk and 7.3 and 11% high chronic risks for fish and aquatic invertebrates, respectively. Similarly, 5.5 and 8.7% high acute risks and 6.8 and 3.9% high chronic risks were observed for the soil ecosystem and birds, respectively. 23% of the evaluated active ingredients were indicated to be highly risky to bees when beehives are present inside the sprayed crop while 7.8% of them are highly risky when beehives are present outside the field of the sprayed crop. The fungicide metalaxyl, the herbicides acetochlor, alachlor, mecoprop and tembotrion, and the insecticides carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon and methidathion were predicted to pose high acute or chronic risks to humans or other vertebrates if surface water is used as a source of drinking water. Future studies should give emphasis on how the risk assessment results of this study can be implemented to aid the registration process.

N2  - Teff (Eragrostis tef) is an ancient cereal that is indigenous from Ethiopia. Nowadays, teff grain is becoming popular to many parts of the world. Teff is gluten-free in nature, has high iron and fiber content, and many other health benefits make this crop interesting to many consumers. Since no insect pests are attacking the teff grains, farmers do not apply pesticides on it, unlike maize and other grains. Nevertheless, residues of organochlorine pesticides have been detected at an alarming level that could pose a consumer risk. Teff is often consumed as injera which is a fermented flat pancake. The main aim of the present study is, therefore, to investigate the effect of household food processing (doughing and baking) on the reduction of pesticide residues from teff. Pesticide residues previously detected in teff grain such as permethrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, p,p’-DDE, p,p’-DDD, o,p’-DDT, and p,p’-DDT were spiked and extracted followed by the subsequent household processing which are generally doughing (dough making followed by fermentation) and baking. From the findings of this study, doughing decrease the pesticide residues in the range of 59.9–86.4% and baking in the range of 63.2–90.2%. Kruskal−Wallis analysis indicates that the reduction of pesticide residues by baking is significantly different from doughing (p-value < 0.0001). There is also a significant difference between non-fermented and fermented dough (p-value = 0.012). The processing factor for doughing and baking was less than one (PF < 1 = reduction factor) which indicates the reduction of pesticides due to teff processing. The cumulative effect of these processing methods is important to evaluate the risks associated with the ingestion of pesticides, particularly in teff grain.

N2  - Background Acute pesticide intoxication has an important public health significance in Ethiopia, but there is limited information about the risk factors of API. Flower farm and small-scale farm workers may have increased risk of pesticide exposure from pesticides used at their work place. This study investigates the risk factors of API among flower farm workers and small-scale farmers, in Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional survey involving 516 persons was conducted. Participants were grouped according to their jobs; flower farm workers and small-scale farmers. In a structured interview, participants were asked about possible work-related risk factors of API defined as at least two health symptoms within 48 hours of pesticide exposure the last year. Prevalence ratio was calculated using binomial regression model, adjusted for age; Fishers exact test was used to compare dichotomous variables having small numbers; and Mantel-Haenszel statistics was used to compare the association between the respective risk factors and API between flower farm and small-scale farmers. Results The mean age of the study participants was 30 years. Flower farm workers had higher risk of API than small-scale farmers (PR = 4.5, 95% CI: 3.20, 6.35). Among small-scale farmers none of the risk factors were significantly associated with API. Lack of safety training, not following pesticide lable instruction and bathing after pesticide use were significant risk factors for API among flower farm workers. The association between these risk factors and API was significantly different between flower farm and small-scale farmers (p < 0.05). Conclusion Work at flower farm was a significant predictor of API. Lack of pesticide safety training, not following pesticide labels and poor hygiene measures were the risk factors associated with API among flower farm workers, but not among small-scale farmers.

N2  - Vegetable growers’ knowledge of pest and their control method was assessed in 2014 in East Shewa zone, Ethiopia. Vegetable growers were well aware of key pests of vegetables, although some of them did not consider pests as constraint to vegetable production. All respondents scouted their vegetables for pests and used presence or absence of pest as criterion for spraying. About 76% of the respondents read pesticide label before buying pesticides, while the rest 24% of the respondents did not read pesticide labels. All vegetable growers sprayed insecticide, whereas fungicides and herbicides were applied by 90% and 7% of the respondents, respectively. About 72% of the respondents washed their sprayer after each application day and discharged the washings onto the soil. Moreover, the majority (62%) of the respondents threw empty pesticide containers around the field. Also, it was found that 71% of the respondents did not use personal protective equipment (PPE) while spraying pesticides, but a few used one or two types of PPE. More than half of the respondents sprayed pesticides on mature crops and sold the produce within three to five days.

N2  - Lake Ziway, a freshwater lake located in Ethiopia, is under the pressure of pesticide and nutrient pollution due to agricultural activity and urbanization. This study has analysed concentrations of insecticides, fungicides and nutrients in water and sediment samples of Lake Ziway taken in the wet and dry season at 13 sites expected to be under different environmental stress and assessed their expected ecological impacts. Malathion, dimethoate, metalaxyl, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion and endosulfan were detected in more than half of the water samples, while diazinon, α-cypermethrin and endosulfan were frequently detected (>25%) in sediment samples. Higher levels of physicochemical parameters were observed at sample locations proximate to agricultural and urban activities. Risk quotients (RQ) and multi-substance Potentially Affected Fraction (msPAFRA) were calculated to assess the ecological risk of individual and mixture of pesticides, respectively. The majority of the pesticides detected in the water of the lake showed a potential acute risk (RQ > 1), specifically the insecticides chlorpyrifos, λ-cyhalothrin and α-cypermethrin for which high potential acute risks were calculated using a 2nd tier risk assessment. Levels of pesticides in sediment showed low ecological risks. Arthropods and fishes are expected to be highly affected by mixtures of pesticides (msPAFRA = < 1–80%) detected at locations that are proximate to smallholders’ farms, and receive largescale farms’ wastewater and at sites where inflow rivers join the lake. Macroinvertebrates based redundancy analysis showed the effectiveness of EPT richness to assess ecological status of the lake. Training for smallholder farmers on pesticides safety and usage, and implementation of improved effluent management mechanisms by floriculture farms are urgently needed intervention measures to reduce the pollution.

N2  - Background: Congenital anomaly is a partial or complete structural and/or functional defect during intrauterine life. Globally, major congenital anomalies account for 6% of all newborns among which about 94% of cases occurred in developing countries. In spite of its public health importance, very limited studies are reported in Ethiopia, and hardly any study in Arsi Zone. Objectives: To determine the predictors of congenital anomalies among newborns in Arsi Zone Public Hospitals, Southeast Ethiopia. Methods: A multi-center institutional-based case-control study was conducted in 418 (105 cases and 313 controls) of newborns in Arsi Zone Public Hospitals. Descriptive analysis, binary and multivariable logistic regressions were implemented. Results: In this study, women who have been drinking alcohol during pregnancy were 3.48 times more prone to have newborns with congenital anomalies than their counterparts (AOR = 3.48; 95% CI: 1.38, 8.74). The likelihood of having a newborn with congenital anomalies was six and four times higher for women who had a maternal illness (AOR = 6.10; 95%CI: 2.39, 15.57) and chewing khat during pregnancy (AOR = 4; 95%CI: 1.49, 10.65), respectively. Moreover, the lack of folic acid supplementation and pesticides during pregnancy were 3.25 and 4.76 times more likely to experience a newborn with congenital anomalies, respectively. Conclusion: Alcohol drinking, maternal illness, khat chewing, and chemical exposure during pregnancy had a significant association with the occurrence of congenital anomalies. While, taking folic acid supplements had a protective effect. Health experts and the community should take these factors into consideration and act accordingly.

N2  - Pesticides are commonly used in the prevention or control of pests such as insect pests, mites, disease, and weeds in crops to increase production and productivity. The aim of the current study was designed to assess the pesticide utilization, practice, pesticide-related knowledge, and perception of farmers and to evaluate the protective measure taken by the farmers. For this purpose, field surveys were carried in Amibara, Gewane, Assayita, and Fentale districts during the 2019 main crop cropping season. A total of 128 small-scale holder farmers, 25 large-scale holder farmers, 30 sprayers, and 12 extensions were interviewed closed and opened questioners. The results revealed that the majority of farmers (44.5%) between the age of 41 and 50 years old, while only fourteen those (9.4%) were more than 51 years old. Regarding the educational level of smallholder farmers, 49.2% were illiterates, 27.9% elementary school, 17.0% secondary school and 5.8% had completed high school. The majority of sprayers (66.7%) were elementary school level. The unsafe and indiscriminate use of pesticides in agriculture represents a major hazard to the environment and human health. All farmers (100%) acknowledged that pesticides were harmful to their health and the environment. Over 63.2% of the farmers did not read or follow pesticide label instructions, and 78.5% did not use any personal protective equipment during spray operation and formulation pesticides. When disposing of pesticide empty containers, respondents adopted unsafe practices such as through near irrigated canal, burning, dumping in the field, domestic use, and burying. Less than 50% of smallholder farmers obtained training on pesticide use 14.8%, application method 16.6%, disposal of empty container 13.3%, and storage and safety 10.2%. Results also demonstrated that all farmers showed poor practices regarding the disposal of empty pesticide containers. The present study revealed that the utilization and practices of pesticides in irrigated cotton-producing areas in the Awash Valley of Ethiopia. It also demonstrated the role of retailers, importers, and state extension workers in providing information and advice to the farmers. Future researches should focus on the merit and demerit of mixing two or more pesticides to control insect pests and on the evaluation of different pesticide resistance development against a variety of insect pests in cotton-growing areas.

N2  - The use of pesticides is increasing from time to time due to their significant importance in maximizing crop production. This situation raised concerns about their potentially adverse effects on honeybee health and the environment, particularly in countries where regulations are not strictly implemented and farmers' knowledge of safe handling procedures is inadequate. This study was conducted in Chilga district, North Gonder, to assess utilization, types, and supply routes of pesticides. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected using semistructured questionnaires, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions. A multistage sampling technique was used to select 353 respondents (155 beekeepers and 198 nonbeekeepers), and a semistructured questionnaire was administered to the selected respondents. The result indicated a rapid increment in pesticide use regardless of its recent introduction to the district. Out of the ten different kinds of pesticides being used in the study area (2,4-D, diazinon 60%, glycel 41%, diazinon 60%, DDT, a mixture of 2-4-D with glycel, mancozeb 80%, malathion 50%, endosulfan 35%, agrothoate 40%, and ethiosulfane 10%), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, glycel, diazinon, and endosulfan 35% are the most widely used ones. Most of the farmers access these pesticides from illegal traders. About 71.3% of the respondents had no access to advice, and 86.9% of them had no training on how to apply pesticides safely to themselves, to the honeybees, and to the environment. The respondents keep extra pesticides at home and use empty pesticide containers for storing food items. In general, integrated efforts are needed to make farmers in Chilga district aware of their knowledge gap on the safe handling and utilization of pesticides.

N2  - Background: Congenital malformations are structural, functional, and metabolic defects that develop during the organogenesis period and present at birth or later in life. There has been little research on congenital malformations in Ethiopia, knowledge on the incidence of birth defects at birth is unknown and the etiologies of the anomalies are limited. This study, therefore, aimed to assess the modifiable risks of congenital anomalies among women in Bale zone hospitals, Ethiopia. Methods: An unmatched case-control study was conducted from February 2018 to January 2019 in the Bale zone; namely Goba referral hospital, Robe, Ginnir and Dolomena hospitals. A total of 409 women were selected. Mothers who gave birth with any type of congenital malformation were assigned as cases and those who gave live births without any congenital abnormalities were assigned as controls. Controls were selected by the lottery method from the labor ward. For each case, two consecutive controls were included. Data were entered into Epi-data 3.1 and exported into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 for analysis. Logistic regression was conducted to analyze the data. Results: Alarmingly, women who had been exposed to pesticides during the current pregnancy were two times more prone to give congenital malformed infants than their counterparts (AOR = 3.19; 95% CI = 1.31, 10.96). Additionally, those women who chewed khat during the periconceptional period were two times more likely to have congenital malformed infants as compared to women who did not engage in this activity (AOR = 2.40; 95% CI = 1.11, 5.19). Conclusions: Urgent attention needs to be given by public health professionals and services to khat chewing and maternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy to reduce the risk of congenital malformations.

N2  - Introduction. Farmers use a large number of pesticides to increase the productivity of Khat cultivation. Since Khat is consumed by many Ethiopians as a habit, there may be a significant concentration of pesticide residues in Khat leaves which result in adverse effects among the exposed population. Excess use of pesticides in Khat causes cancer, genotoxicity, and endocrine disturbances. The current study aimed to determine the concentration of selected pesticide residues on Khat leaves samples and to estimate the possible health risk on consumers. Methods. Thirty Khat samples were collected from Khat cultivators in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. Pesticide residue extraction and cleanup of Khat samples were performed using the QuEChERS method. Data were also collected about personal variables and Khat consumption habits. The pesticide concentrations were determined and the health risks were estimated. Results. Profenofos, dimethoate, and chlorpyrifos were detected in 6 (20%), 24 (80%), and 28 (93.3%) Khat samples, respectively. However, diazinon was detected in two samples and endosulfan I was not detected. The average concentration of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, profenofos, and diazinon in Khat samples was 75.39 ± 20.26, 130 ± 48.94, 242.45 ± 119.79, and 81.5 ± 21.0 μg/kg, respectively. The HQ for diazinon was greater than 1 which shows the chronic health risks associated with intake of diazinon among Khat chewers. The acute health risks associated with intake of profenofos and diazinon were minimal. Discussion. Pesticide residue exposure is a risk factor for cardiac complications, reduction in antioxidant defense system, and developing neurological symptoms. All the pesticides were higher than the European Union Maximum Residue Levels (EU-MRL). Diazinon has the potential to cause higher chronic health risks. Chronic Khat chewers in the region may face potential health risks from pesticide residues. Awareness creation among people in the study area is necessary to avoid the adverse health effects of pesticide residues.

N2  - The floriculture sector is booming in Ethiopia, making the country the second largest flower exporter in Africa and one of the largest suppliers of flowers globally. Despite the enormous advantages of the Ethiopian floriculture industry to the country's economy, the industry's unsustainability related to environmental and human rights is growing. Failure to protect the environment can have profound negative impacts on long-term economic development and human rights, including the right to life, adequate food, water and housing. The floriculture industry has been identified as having the potential to grow and contribute positively to the agricultural transformation and economy of Ethiopia. Policy, laws and regulations play a vital role in the implementation of any regulatory objective. During the last decade, Ethiopia has developed many policies and laws that link to improving the environment, and the flower farm industry itself has adopted self-regulation and standards, enhancing the protection of workers and the environment. But there is increasing evidence that the economic benefits of the flower industry come at the expense of the environment. So, what is the impact of these State and non-State regulations on a safe and clean environment? This paper aims to analyse how, why and under what circumstances environmental policy implementation might work or fail, by investigating the challenges for the floriculture industry relating to the intensive use of pesticides and water, and inappropriate waste disposal in the policy implementation process. It is safe to say that Ethiopia has developed a lot of legislation on the environment but the challenge of effective monitoring and enforcement remains. This paper concludes with recommendations, based on the fact that the principles of environmental rights, the right to life and the right to development cannot be realised in the absence of the right to a healthy environment.

N2  - Acute poisoning is a global pediatric emergency problem. However, a wide variation in patterns of acute poisoning and associated factors across different geographical regions was stated. As a result, our research focused on the investigation of acute poisoning in children. An Institutional-based Retrospective study design was conducted at the University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital from October 2016 to October 2020. The analysis of the data was performed via SPSS Version 25. Furthermore, multiple logistic regression analysis was recruited. A P-value ≤ 0.05 was declared as statistically significant. Our study's prevalence of acute poisoning was 82/5489 (1.5%). 53 (64.6%) of patients were males. Of the total patients who had the diagnosis of poisoning, 54 (65.9%) came from rural areas. Venom was the most frequent offending agent (26.8%) and oral ingestion was the most common route of exposure (70.7%). Of the total patients who had the diagnosis of poisoning, 54 (65.9%) came from rural areas. Venom was the most frequent offending agent (26.8%), followed by insecticides (organophosphates) (21.5%). Accidental poisoning was the most common mode of poisoning more often than intentional (75.6–24.4%). The digestive tract (oral ingestion) (69.5%) was the commonest route of poisoning, followed by the cutaneous (skin bite) (24.4%). Death was three times more likely in the rural population than in urban residents [AOR 2.9 (1.21–13.7); P value 0.046]. Appropriate emergency care is the mainstay of the supportive management protocol for childhood poisoning.

N2  - The concentrations and biomagnifications of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites were examined in four fish species (Clarias gariepinus, Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zillii, and Carassius auratus) from Lake Ziway, Rift Valley, Ethiopia. Paired stomach content analysis, and stable isotope ratio of nitrogen (δ15N, ‰) and carbon (δ13C, ‰) were used to study the trophic position of the fish species in the lake. 4,4'-DDE, 4,4'-DDT and 4,4'-DDD were the main DDTs identified in the fish samples, with 4,4'-DDE as the most predominant metabolite, with mean concentration ranging from 1.4 to 17.8ngg-1 wet weight (ww). The concentrations of DDTs found in fish from Lake Ziway were, in general lower than those found in most studies carried out in other African Lakes. However, the presence of DDT in all tissue samples collected from all fish species in the lake indicates the magnitude of the incidence. Moreover, the observed mean 4,4'-DDE to 4,4'-DDT ratio below 1 in C. auratus from Lake Ziway may suggest a recent exposure of these species to DDT, indicating that a contamination source is still present. 4,4'-DDE was found to biomagnify in the fish species of the lake, and increases with trophic level, however, the biomagnification rate was generally lower than what has been reported from other areas. Significantly higher concentrations of 4,4'-DDE were found in the top consumer fish in Lake Ziway, C. gariepinus than in O. niloticus (t=2.6, P<0.01), T. zillii (t=2.5, P<0.02) and C. auratus (t=2.2, P<0.03). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Why asthma is rare in rural subsistence societies is not clear. We tested the hypotheses that the risk of asthma is reduced by intestinal parasites or hepatitis A infection, and increased by exposure to dust-mite allergen or organophosphorus insecticides in urban and rural areas of Jimma, Ethiopia. Methods: From 12 876 individuals who took part in a study of asthma and atopy in urban and rural Jimma in 1996, we identified all who reported wheeze in the previous 12 months, and a random subsample of controls. In 1999, we assessed parasites in faecal samples, Der p 1 levels in bedding, hepatitis A antibodies, serum cholinesterase (a marker of organophosphorus exposure), total and specific serum IgE, and skin sensitisation to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus in 205 cases and 399 controls aged over 16 years. The effects of parasitosis, Der p 1 level, hepatitis A seropositivity, and cholinesterase concentration on risk of wheeze, and the role of IgE and skin sensitisation in these associations, were analysed by multiple logistic regression. Findings: The risk of wheeze was independently reduced by hookworm infection by an odds ratio of 0.48 (95% CI 0.24-0.93, p=0.03), increased in relation to Der p 1 level (odds ratio per quartile 1.26 [1.00-1.59], p=0.05), and was unrelated to hepatitis A seropositivity or cholinesterase concentration. In the urban population, D pteronyssinus skin sensitisation was more strongly related to wheeze (9.45 [5.03-17.75]) than in the rural areas (1.95 [0.58-6.61], p for interaction=0.017), where D pteronyssinus sensitisation was common, but unrelated to wheeze in the presence of high-intensity parasite infection. Interpretation: High degrees of parasite infection might prevent asthma symptoms in atopic individuals.

N2  - A survey of 90 farmers, randomly selected over six sorghum-growing districts in eastern Ethiopia was carried out during July to August, 2001 in the long rainy season. The study investigated farmers' perceptions of the importance of stem-borer and farm practices influencing the pest. Sorghum farming was characterized by smallholdings with an average land size of 4.3 ha, an average family size of 6 and an average yield of 878 kg ha-1. Farmers cited pests, drought, and shortage of seed, land and labour as the main constraints upon sorghum production. Stem-borers were perceived to be the major pests requiring control. The majority of the farmers never applied chemical insecticides against stem-borers due to lack of capital and unavailability of insecticides. Because of restricted access to improved varieties, farmers largely used local cultivars of sorghum selected for yield potential but with little emphasis on insect resistance. Very few farmers destroyed sorghum residues after harvest. The majority of farmers grew sorghum under intercropping mainly due to the high yield expected. Crop rotation in sorghum fields was not widely practised due to land shortage.

N2  - Pesticide sprayers from five state-owned agricultural farms took part in a study that evaluated their knowledge, attitude and practice of pesticide use on farms. Demographic features of the sprayers showed that the majority of them had primary-level education. The duration of work as sprayers on the farms ranged from 1 month to ∼ 10 years, with 59% of them having worked as sprayers for <5 years. Their knowledge about hazards from pesticides was indicated by the responses they gave to the standard questionnaire. Careful working was considered to be very important by 93% of them, while only 7% suggested the use of personal protective devices (PPD). On some of the farms, sprayers were provided with inappropriate/unfit and worn-out PPD; 18% of the sprayers had unfit goggles and 29% used worn-out gloves. To minimize risk from pesticide application, 63% suggested avoiding applications during windy and sunny weather, 32% suggested the provision and proper use of PPD, while only 3% of them felt medical check-ups and training were important, and 2% suggested risks from spraying were best controlled by leaving their job. The hygiene and sanitation practices of the sprayers require much improvement. An attitudinal change is needed, together with the provision of better facilities and infrastructure. We recommend that pesticide safety education be given to the sprayers. In addition, appropriate PPD should be used, with regular maintenance and timely replacement of worn-out parts.

N2  - Conservation tillage systems have been adopted by farmers in many countries to solve the problem of land degradation and declining water productivity. Direct application of such tillage systems has not been possible among resource-poor, smallholder farmers in semi-arid areas of Ethiopia. Problems such as the lack of rainfall, the costs of herbicides and implements, and the special cultivation needs of the crop tef, which can not be planted in rows, have developed locally-adapted conservation tillage systems. This book considers traditional tillage systems and the results of tests carried out on appropriate conservation tillage implements and systems for smallholder farmers in semi-arid regions of Ethiopia. The traditional tillage implement, the Maresha Plough, and the related tillage systems were identified as being the main cause of repeated and cross-ploughing, leading to land degradation and reduced water productivity. Modified implements were found to be suitable for conservation tillage systems while being simple, light and affordable. Two types of tillage systems developed for maize and tef were found to reduce surface runoff, increase availability of water to crops and increase yields.

N2  - Objectives: To assess the health status, attitude and level of awareness of safe pesticide handling practices of farm workers engaged in the application of pesticides on agricultural farms. Design: Cross sectional study. Setting: Two farms in northwest Ethiopia, 2004 Subjects: Farm workers of job categories; sprayers, pest assessors, supervisors, spraymachine mechanics and tractor operators. Results: The farm workers had respiratory symptoms of cough, phlegm and wheezing. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not show abnormalities. Liver function tests showed elevated values. Respiratory symptoms in the farm workers revealed that cough phlegm and wheezing at Ayehu farm were significantly (p<0.05) higher than the controls. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at Birr Farm in the sprayers and mechanics were significantly higher than the controls (p<0.05). The ALP value in the sprayers, glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) in the assessors and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) in the sprayers and mechanics at Ayehu were significantly higher than the controls (p<0.05). From a total of 82 farm workers 35.7% at Birr and 75% at Ayehu Farm described that they were not formally instructed about safe pesticide handling methods. Conclusion: The farm workers health is affected by the unwise use of pesticides. The level of awareness and attitude on safe pesticide handling practices is low. It is recommended that appropriate type of personal protective device (PPD), in service training about the proper use of chemical pesticides and periodic medical check-up should be fulfilled to minimise the adverse health effects of chemical pesticides.

N2  - Indigenous tillage systems are often undervalued in conservation agriculture (CA). In Ethiopia, since the 1970s there have been several attempts to develop and implement often major modifications to the marasha, the traditional ox-drawn ard plough, with the main aim of creating various types of surface depressions. The establishment of furrows and ridges increases soil moisture and grain yield and reduces soil loss. Dissemination of the modified tools, however, remains limited. Recent tendencies are towards testing relatively simple conservation agriculture tools. Major challenges remain, however; the need for capacity building and problems in marketing the tools. From experimental plots, often worked with exotic tools, there is a long road to real adoption by farmers. Rather than developing yet another CA tool, we investigate whether CA-based resource-conserving technologies might be achieved successfully with simple changes to the use of the marasha. On-farm observations on traditional conservation techniques were carried out throughout the northern Ethiopian highlands, and experiments were conducted involving resource-conserving technologies. Farmers traditionally use the marasha ard plough for various types of in situ soil and water conservation by creating surface depressions, either at the moment of sowing (terwah, derdero) or after crop emergence (shilshalo). Building upon this indigenous knowledge, we further developed resource-conserving technologies into a system named derdero+, whereby the traditional ard plough was found suitable for a bed-and-furrow system. From the socio-economic point of view, implementation of permanent beds and retention of stubble leads to decreased oxen (and straw) requirements, but also to an increased need for weeding in the first years. To overcome that problem, we introduced glyphosate herbicide into the tillage system. The decreased runoff (-51%) and soil loss (-81%) allow protection of the downslope areas from flooding, but soil nutrient build-up and soil structure improvement are slow processes, and hence the full benefit of the permanent bed system can only be expected after some years. Overall, this type of resource-conserving technology can be part of the ongoing intensification process which includes physical soil and water conservation, slope reforestation and irrigation development. It has, however, its own niche: the cropped land sensu stricto, i.e. The most important part of the land, both for the farmer and for a nation that is striving for long-term food security. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

N2  - Surveys were undertaken in six districts of southwestern Ethiopia from July to October 2003 to investigate farmers' perceptions and management practices of insect pests on traditionally stored sorghum. The survey involved 138 randomly selected farmers who were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Storage insect pests were perceived as the major insect pests of sorghum. The majority of the farmers estimated sorghum yield losses of up to 50% due to insect damage during storage. High temperature and lack of storage hygiene were cited as the major factors resulting in insect infestation of stored sorghum. Infestations of stored sorghum insect pests were common on different forms of sorghum, which stored in various types of farm storage. Farmers classified sorghum varieties according to the level of resistance to stored sorghum insect pests. Only about 32% of the farmers had access to chemical insecticides for the control of stored sorghum insect pests, while the majority of them used cultural practices and locally available plant materials as storage protectants. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - Zegie Peninsula contains a remnant dry Afromontane forest, where about 90% was previously classified as dense forest. Recently, the forest cover is significantly reduced. Zegie has a high density of 643 persons km-2, predominantly inhabited by religious people, priests and monks. The aim of the study was to understand the dynamics of socioeconomic and resource management factors affecting the sustainable use of woody species in the peninsula and gain a window into the world of isolated religious communities and their complex and evolving relationships with forests. A formal survey of 60 households (4% of population) was conducted where cross-section data were gathered through a pre-coded (structured) question- naire. The results revealed that household characteristics, household endowment (farm resources ownership), choice of livelihood strategy and farming constraints affect attitudes and behaviours towards sustainable use of tree resources. Poorer households had smaller resource ownership, were female-headed and illiterate. They also had younger and smaller family sizes and a desire to have more children. Hence, they are not likely to practice family planning contributing to increasing overpopulation. They experienced acute shortage of land and also felt tenure insecurity. Perhaps because they cannot afford fertilizers and pesticides, soil fertility as well as pests and diseases are serious constraints for them. Owing to shortage of land and tenure insecurity, among other things, they have not planted trees in the past and are not likely to plant trees in the future. Much of their income comes from wood selling, therefore, are likely to engage in deforestation. They have diversified their livelihood into artisanship, cloth weaving, and fishing but are limited by low skill, capital, and access to market. The strategy to save the remaining forests in the peninsula, therefore, should include reducing the proportion of poorer households. In order to achieve this objective, a three pronged approach is required: (1) improving access to resource ownership; (2) removing or minimizing farming constraints; and (3) creating enabling environment for families to engage in diversified livelihood strategies. © International Society for Tropical Ecology.

N2  - Soil erosion and declining soil quality are the major constraints for crop production and sustainable land management in Ethiopia. A conservation agriculture (CA) experiment was conducted in 2006 at Gumselasa, Northern Ethiopia, on experimental plots established in 2005 on a farmer's field. The objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the short-term changes in soil quality of a Vertisol due to the implementation of conservation agriculture practices and to assess their effect on soil erosion, crop yield and yield components of tef (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter). The treatments were permanent bed (PB), terwah (TERW) and conventional tillage (TRAD). Soil organic matter (SOM) was significantly higher in PB (2.49%) compared to TRAD (2.33%) and TERW (2.36%). Although aggregate stability of PB (0.94) was higher than TRAD (0.83), the difference was not significant. PB had larger macroporosity (0.07 m3 m-3) compared to the other treatments. PB reduced runoff volume by 50% and TERW by 16% compared to TRAD. PB also reduced soil loss by 86% and TERW by 53% in comparison to TRAD. Despite the above soil physical quality improvements and effectiveness in runoff and soil loss reduction, biomass and plant height of tef were significantly higher in TRAD than PB. The significantly high weed dry matter at first weeding, the types of weeds and their water uptake behavior might have caused the lower tef yield on the PB. We therefore recommend that appropriate rate of herbicides must be used while growing tef using CA practices. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Knowledge and information on farmers' perception and its influence on adoption of modern wheat varieties, awareness and source of new wheat production technology, wheat seed sources, and on-farm seed-management practices remain sporadic in Ethiopia. This study was conducted to understand the functioning of the wheat seed system in four major wheat-growing areas of Ethiopia. A total of 304 wheat growers were interviewed in Arsi, West Shoa, North Shoa, and East Gojam zones. Most wheat growers were aware of modern wheat varieties, agronomic packages, and agrochemical inputs; >90% of farmers had knowledge of these agricultural technologies, the extension system being the major source of information. There is an extensive adoption of new technologies: the majority of farmers grew modern wheat varieties (76% on recommended list and 10% "obsolete" varieties), and applied fertilizers (97%) and herbicides (64%) to wheat. Although a wide range of modern wheat varieties were adopted, ET 13 (West Shoa, North Shoa, and East Gojam) and Pavon 76 (Arsi) were predominant and each was grown by 20% of the farmers, replacing previously popular varieties, such as Dashen and Enkoy. Farmers identified as many as 26 technological and socioeconomic criteria for adopting and continuously growing a particular wheat variety. However, grain yield, food quality, marketability, grain color, and grain size appeared to be the most important criteria and transcended all zones. Traditional farmer-to-farmer seed exchange played a significant role for lateral diffusion of modern varieties and was a major source of seed for planting wheat crop annually. The informal sector was an initial source of modern wheat varieties for 58% of the farmers, through neighbors or other farmers (36%), relatives (7%), or local trading (15%). Moreover, the majority of farmers sourced their wheat seed informally whereby 79% used retained seed or sourced off-farm from neighbors (9%) and local traders or markets (3%) for planting wheat during the survey year. In contrast, the formal sector was the initial source of wheat varieties for 40% of farmers, but only 8% of the farmers purchased certified seed in the 1997/98 crop season. Farmers' positive perception of seed influenced them to practice different management approaches to maintain the quality of their wheat seed through on- farm selection (67%), cleaning (83%), chemical treatment (4%), separate storage (65%), or informal assessment of seed quality (34%), whereas the responsibility was shared between men and women. The adoption and diffusion of modern bread-wheat varieties and associated technologies appeared to be higher than for other crops, although largely remained informal. It is imperative for the agricultural research to develop farmer-preferred varieties and for the government to strengthen and devise appropriate strategy for seed delivery that is responsive to the needs of the farmers. Within this context, it is important to recognize the role of the formal and informal seed system to create a sustainable seed industry. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Liquidrliquid and liquid-solid extraction technique was employed to extract pesticide residues in water and fish samples, respectively, using 1:1 (v/v) ethyl acetate/ dichloromethane mixture before being analyzed by gas chromatography. The highest level of pesticide contaminations was recorded in the Chemu lagoon as compared to the Korle lagoon and Fosu lagoon, with the Etsii lagoon showing the least contamination. The total average pesticide residues in water samples from the four lagoons: Chemu, Korle, Fosu and Etsii are 2.6384 mg/L, 0.4992 mg/L, 0.3045 mg/L and 1.3629 mg/L, respectively The total average pesticide residues obtained in fish samples (Sarotherodon melaanothern) from the Fosu and Etsii lagoons are 0.0155 mg/kg and 0.0088 mg/kg, respectively.

N2  - Rose cultivation in Ethiopia is a relatively new industry. Application of chemical pesticides is the main pest control method, with harmful impact on the workers, the environment, the crop and the plastic greenhouse cover. Global markets increasingly demand low residue levels, supported by some form of certification. Against this background, a broadly supported project was initiated in 2007 to introduce Integrated Pest Management in Ethiopian rose cultivation. The project integrates stakeholders from both the private and public sectors, and focuses on the on-farm testing of established pest management technologies under local conditions. As red spider mite is the predominant pest, its management with a combination of Phytoseiulus persimilis and Amblyseius californicus in a number of agro-ecological zones was evaluated over more than a year during which the system was exposed to a variety of environmental conditions. The main findings are: 1. Careful monitoring and intensive communication are essential for a successful transition from chemical to integrated management. The crop should be free of harmful chemical residues and pest levels should be sufficiently low before predators are released. 2. Spider mite levels are substantially lower (down to complete absence) after release of predators, than if full chemical control is applied. 3. The predator populations establish in most environmental regions. However, low indoor temperatures and very low air humidity are some of the factors that may negatively affect the predator populations. Additional chemical pest management may be required. 4. Farm managers indicate that integrated pest management results in production and quality increase in rose. 5. Knowledge exchange within and among the formal and informal knowledge systems greatly speeds up the learning process. 6. Strategic governmental commitment is a prerequisite. The project now scales up in terms of acreage per farm, number of farms, pests and crops.

N2  - Lake Abaya is part of the Abaya-Chamo lake system, a graben fill in the southern section of the Main Ethiopian Rift Valley. The catchment of the AbayaChamo lake system covers approx. 18 600 km2. Soil erosion processes in the catchment result in off-side effects such as a high sediment load of the tributaries and high deposition rates of fluvio-lacustrine sediments. Hence, lake turbidity of Lake Abaya has increased distinctly during the last four decades and widespread delta sediments have been deposited. These sediments are predominantly composed of clay minerals and detrital organic matter which are both ideal adsorbent material for pollutants. Whereas heavy metals in the delta sediments were not detected above geogenic concentrations, high levels of DDT and metabolites were recorded. While at first sight Persistent Organic Pollutants (POP) sequestrated to fluvio-lacustrine sediments seem to have been taken out of the food web, initial eutrophication must be assumed for Lake Abaya, indicating a likely remobilisation of POPs.

N2  - The efficacy of different aqueous dilutions of crude seed extract of Millettia ferruginea (Hochst.) Baker (1, 3, 5 and 10%) was evaluated under field conditions in terms of the level of damage and yield loss of maize caused by the maize stemborer Busseola fusca (Fuller) in Hawassa, southern Ethiopia. The insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin 5EC, applied at a rate of 16A g active ingredient/hectare, was used as the reference product. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The maize variety A511 was planted in individual plots of 60A m2. Data on stand count, leaf infestation, bored stem and dead heart were collected weekly. Plots sprayed with the 5% concentration of Millettia showed low levels of damage (9-11% leaf infestation, 0.4% dead heart, 14-17% bored stem and <A 0.2% bored ear), compared with plots sprayed with lambda-cyhalothrin. The treatments with 1 and 3% concentrations of Millettia were inferior to those with lambda-cyhalothrin and 5 and 10% concentrations of Millettia. In contrast, the treatment with the 10% concentration of Millettia led to the death of plants, thereby lowering the yield. About 80% of the total length of individual maize stalks from the untreated plots was internally tunnelled by the feeding larvae, while the internal stem tunnelling was low (A <A 7%) in plants treated with Millettia at concentrations of 3, 5 and 10%. Among the treatments with Millettia, higher yields (37-48 decitonnes/hectare) were obtained from maize plots treated with 5% concentration. The use of the aqueous crude seed extract of M. ferruginea at a concentration of 5% applied two to three times is recommended for the control of B. fusca in maize. Copyright © icipe 2013.

N2  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production in the tropics is usually limited by damage due to Angular Leaf Spot (ALS) caused by Phaeoisariopsis grisola. Field experiments were conducted in 2005, 2006 and 2007 at Jimma, Ethiopia, to determine the amount of yield loss due to ALS and to investigate the relationship between ALS and bean yield. Different levels of disease severity were created on two common bean varieties (GLPX-92 andICA15541) using natural epidemics by spraying the fungicide benomyl at 7-14- 21 and 28-day intervals and by seed dressing. Generally, all fungicide sprays significantly reduced ALS severity and increased yield and seed weight but seed dressing did not affect significantly. The relative yield and seed weight losses to ALS ranged from 2 to 47 and 15 to 33%, respectively. Single-point regression models predicted that for each per cent increase in ALS severity, there was a seed yield loss of 18 to 124.5 kg ha -1 inGLPX and 12.9 to 103.9 kg ha 1 for ICA15541 and 100-seed weight loss per sample of 100 seeds of 10 to 13 g for GLPX-92 and 13 to 22 mg for ICA15541. The study suggests that fungicide sprays affect ALS epidemics and influence the amount of loss in yield attributable to ALS permitting the crop to reach physiological maturity without being under severe infection. Thus fungicide sprays can be used as a means to reduce ALS severity and increase common bean yield. © 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

N2  - Supported liquid membrane (SLM) extraction was optimised for trace extraction and enrichment of selected triazine herbicides from a variety of agro-processed fruit juices and Ethiopian honey wine (Tej) samples. In the extraction process, a 1:1 mixture of n-undecane and di-n-hexylether was immobilised in a thin porous PTFE membrane that forms a barrier between two aqueous phases (the donor and acceptor phases) in a flow system. The extracts constitute the selectively enriched analytes collected from the acceptor phase and were analysed by transferring to a HPLC-UV system using a diode array detector at 235 nm. High enrichment factors were obtained with very good repeatability of results, and the detection limit was lower than 3.00 μg l-1 for ametryn in apple juice. The optimised method showed very good linearity of over 50-500 μg l-1 with a correlation coefficient of >0.990 or better for triplicate analysis. All chromatograms gave well resolved peaks with no interfering peaks at the retention times of the selected triazines, showing high selectivity of the SLM extraction method in combination with HPLC-UV for the selected matrices. The optimised method can be used as an alternative solventless extraction method for microgram-level extraction of other triazine herbicides and a variety of pesticides from liquid and semi-liquid environmental, biological and food matrices. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Farmers in the developing world are at risk of pesticide exposure, particularly in low-income countries with a sizable agricultural sector like Ethiopia. The present investigation provides baseline data to develop strategies for the control of pesticide exposure and the prevention of pesticide poisoning. Methods: A questionnaire survey of a stratified random sample of peasant farmers belonging to peasant associations was conducted. Results: Most surveyed farmers sprayed pesticides without any personal protective equipment. The majority of participants reported using empty pesticide containers for drinking and food storage. Twenty percent of farmers applied pesticides by sweeping with plant leaves in a hazardous manner. Conclusions: Ethiopian peasant farmers appeared to have limited knowledge of the hazards of pesticides and generally did not handle pesticides in a safe manner. Active health education campaigns and appropriate training programs should be instigated to promote safe use of pesticides. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

N2  - A cross sectional study was conducted from November 2008 to March 2009 in Wukro Woreda to determine the prevalence of bee lice and other constraints to honey bee production in the area. The result revealed an overall Braula coeca (bee louse) prevalence of 4% in the brood and 5.5% in the adult honey bees, respectively. The prevalence of louse infestation recorded in brood and adult bee of the three peasant associations of Wukro Woreda were, 3.3%, 5% in Genfel, 4.9%, 6% in Adikisandid and 3%, 5%, Aynalem, respectively. There was no statistically significant variation in overall prevalence rates of lice infestation between brood and adult bees and locations (P> 0.05). Factors perceived as major constraints to honeybee production by 51 interviewed farmers were frequent occurrence of drought, lack of bee forage, existence of pests and predators and pesticide poisoning in decreasing order of importance. The beekeepers also listed pests and predators that they considered important to be honey badgers, ant like insects, wax moth, birds, spiders, monkeys, snakes and lizards. According to the response of beekeepers, honey badger attack was a serious problem in the Woreda. This study revealed the presence of real threat to beekeeping and honey production from louse infestation, predators, chemical pollution and drought. The effects of drought, pests and predators on beekeeping practice in the study area need to be minimized with appropriate management practices. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.

N2  - A portable and time-integrating field sampler based on the supported liquid membrane (SLM) extraction technique was constructed. Using two programmable syringe pumps and one programmable valve, the sampler could carry out automatic unattended extraction for up to seven extracts, combining the steps of sampling, trace enrichment and clean-up. The sampler was applied to the extraction of four s-triazine herbicides (atrazine, cyanazine, prometryn and terbutryn) and six major degradation products of s-triazines, including three dealkylated products (deethyl deisopropyl atrazine (DDA), deisopropyl atrazine DIA and deethyl atrazine (DEA)) and three hydroxylated products (hydroxy atrazine (ATOH), hydroxy propazine (PROH) and hydroxy terbutylazine (TZOH)). The donor solution was obtained by mixing sample and buffer, consisting of 1Mphosphate buffer at pH 7.0 and 1.7M NaCl, in the ratio of 19: 1 (v/v). Extraction was performed by continuously pumping 10mL portions of donor along the SLM until 3 L of sample had been extracted. The SLM consisted of di-n-hexylether and the acceptor was 1M HCl. After extract collection, extracts were neutralised with NaOH and buffered with phosphate. Extracts were analysed with HPLC, using a gradient elution consisting of 3.5mM phosphate and acetonitrile and UV-detection at 220 nm. Enrichment factors in reagent water ranged from 1.3 (for DIA) to 2739 (for terbutryn). The developed field sampler was tested by carrying out 24-h time-weighted on-site extraction of the ten striazine target compounds in Hawassa Lake and its tributary river, located in the agricultural region of the Southern Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Atrazine, cyanazine and terbutryn were generally below the method detection limit, while prometryn was frequently found. Overall, s-triazines were not persistent in the studied environment and degradation products of s-triazines were found in higher concentrations than the parent herbicides in both the river and the lake. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - The type and combination of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) adopted have a significant effect on agricultural productivity and food security. This study develops a multinomial endogenous switching regression model of farmers' choice of combination of SAPs and impacts on maize income and agrochemicals and family labor use in rural Ethiopia. Four primary results were found. First, adoption of SAPs increases maize income and the highest payoff is achieved when SAPs are adopted in combination rather than in isolation. Second, nitrogen fertilizer use is lower in the package that contains system diversification and conservation tillage. Third, conservation tillage increased pesticide application and labor demand, perhaps to compensate for reduced tillage. However, when it is used jointly with system diversification, it does not have a significant impact on pesticide and labor use. Fourth, in most cases adoption of a package of SAPs increases women workload, suggesting that agricultural intensification technology interventions may not be gender neutral. This implies that policy makers and other stakeholders promoting a combination of technologies can enhance household food security through increasing income and reducing production costs, but need to be aware of the potential gender related outcomes. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Cabbage is one of the important vegetable crops in Ethiopia. The cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae become a key pest which affects the quality of cabbage. The resource poor small scale farmers in Gondar highlands are unable to afford the cost of imported chemical pesticides. In order to find out alternative strategies to farmer's laboratory studies were conducted to check the efficacy of solvent extract of Melia azadarach leaves and seeds and Mentha piperita leaves against aphid. Three concentrations of methanol and aqueous extracts such as 0.25, 0.5 and 1% were tested against aphid by using choice and no choice method. Inno choice method methanol extract of Melia seeds treatment showed minimum number (1.33±0.57) of aphids at 0.25% concentration. Higher concentration (1%) of Mentha leaves and lower concentration (0.25%) of. Melia seed treatment recorded only 0.6±0.57 aphids. Irrespective of concentration and period of exposure wide fluctuation was observed in choice method. Among the three extracts tested, M. piperita leaf extract and M. azadarach seed extract showed promising result. These two plants are easily growing in Ethiopian highlands and it is found to be suitable for resource poor farmers to control aphid menace in cabbage. © IDOSI Publications, 2011.

N2  - The pesticide efficacy of locally available seven botanicals "Gime" (Chenopodium ambrosioides), "Ayderke" (Jatropha curcas), Neem (Azadirachta indica), Melia (Melia azadirach), "Chobe" (Cisus rotonifolia), "Kelewa" (Maesa lanceolata) and "Antharfa" at a rate of 4% weight by weight was evaluated for the control of cowpea bruchid using 200 g cowpea seeds in 500 cm3 volume jar in 2010 and 2011 under laboratory condition at Sirinka Agricultural Research Centre. The combined analysis showed that "Gime" (both leaf and seed) had high speed of pesticide effect as it showed significantly higher per cent of parent adult mortality (84 and 71%, respectively) as to the standard check Malathion 5% dust (100%) in the first day of adult mortality count. "Antharfa" and "Ayderke" also have shown significantly higher per cent of parent adult mortality as to Malathion in the third and fifth day of adult mortality count, respectively. In the seventh day, all botanicals showed significantly higher per cent of adult mortality as compared to untreated check. "Gime" leaf and seed powder, "Ayderke" seed, Neem seed and "Antharfa" leaf powders significantly reduced the number of progeny emergence per day as compared to all other treatments. Moreover, these botanicals were effective in reducing per cent seed damage (0.00, 0.00, 0.57, 5.86 and 10.86%, respectively) and storage loss (0.00, 0.00, 0.073, 1.02 and 2.27%, respectively). Gime (both leaf and seed powder), "Ayderke" seed and Neem seed are locally available, simple for preparation and environmentally friendly. Therefore, these three botanicals can be recommended to satisfy the demand for organic food and save the seed damage and yield loss of cowpea caused by Callosobruchus maculates and bean bruchid (Zabrotes subfasciatus) which has similar biology with Callosobruchus maculatus. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

N2  - Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL, also called kala-azar"), is a life threatening neglected tropical infectious disease which mainly affects the poorest of the poor. VL is prevalent in Ethiopia particularly in the northwest of the country. Understanding the risk factors of VL infection helps in its prevention and control. The aim of the present study was to identify the factors associated with VL. Methods: A case control study was carried out during the period of January-July 2013 in northwest Ethiopia. Cases and controls were diagnosed using clinical presentation, the rk39 rapid diagnostic test and Direct Agglutination Test (DAT). A total of 283 (84.8% males versus 15.2% females) participants were interviewed. 90 cases and 193 controls were involved, matched by age, sex and geographical location with a ratio of 1:2 (case: controls). Univariate and backward multivariate conditional logistic regression were used to identify risk factors of VL. Results: Elevated odds of VL was associated with goat ownership (OR = 6.4; 95%: confidence interval [Cl]: 1.5-28.4), living in houses with cracked wall (OR = 6.4; 95% Cl: 1.6-25.6), increased family size (OR = 1.3; 95% Cl: 1.0-1.8) and the number of days spent in the farm field (OR = 1.1; 95% Cl: 1.0-1.2). However, daily individual activities around the home and farm fields, mainly sleeping on a bed (OR = 0.2; 95%: Cl 0.03-0.9), sleeping outside the house under a bed net (OR = 0.1; 95% Cl: 0.02-0.36)] and smoking plant parts in the house during the night time (OR = 0.1; 95% Cl: 0.01-0.6) were associated with decreased odds of being VL case. Conclusion: Our findings showed that use of bed net and smoke could be helpful for the prevention of VL in the area particularly among individuals who spend most of their time in the farm. VL control effort could be focused on improving housing conditions, such as sealing cracks and crevices inside and outside houses. Further research is warranted to elucidate the role of goats in the transmission of L. donovani, assess the impact of bed nets and the role of the traditional practice of smoking plants.

N2  - The careful selection of parasitoids with a track record of success in similar environmental conditions may increase the likelihood of effective biocontrol. Diamondback moth (DBM) population and level of parasitism were assessed for three years prior to the release of Diadegma semiclausum (Hellén) in June 2008. Thereafter, the DBM population and severity of crop damage and the occurrence of D. semiclausum and indigenous DBM parasitoids were monitored by monthly surveys during the main production season of June to December for three years. Before release, DBM numbers fluctuated between 4.2 and 11.2 per plant and parasitism ranged between 6.5 and 24.7%. DBM density declined to 2.8, 0.9 and 0.7 per plant whilst parasitism levels increased successively to 21, 39 and 38% in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. A significant shift in parasitoid guild was observed after D. semiclausum release: it comprised 18.6, 80.3 and 88.6% of total parasitism in the first, second and third year, respectively. The decline of DBM density following the release of the introduced parasitoid and its establishment will ensure production of Brassica spp. without pesticide use against DBM in the affected area. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and heavy metals are ubiquitous contaminants with high bioaccumulation and persistence in the environment, which can have adverse effects on humans and animals. Although applications of DDTs have been banned in many countries, developing countries like Ethiopia are still using these for agricultural and medicinal purposes. In addition, heavy metals are naturally present in the aquatic environment and distributed globally. In this study, the occurrence, distribution, and ecological risk of DDTs and heavy metals in surface sediments from one of the Ethiopian rift valley lakes were studied. Twenty-five surface sediment samples from Lake Awassa, Ethiopia were collected and analyzed for DDTs and heavy metals. Results showed that concentrations of total DDTs ranged from 3.64 to 40.2 ng/g dry weight. High levels of DDTs were observed in the vicinity of inflow river side and coastal areas with agricultural activities. The heavy metals content were followed the order Zn > Ni > Pb > Cu > Cr > Co > As > Cd > Hg. Correlation analysis and principal components analysis demonstrated that heavy metals were originated from both natural and anthropogenic inputs. The levels of DDE and DDD in surface sediments exceeded the sediment quality guideline values, indicating that adverse effects may occur to the lake. A method based on toxic-response factor for heavy metals revealed that the calculated potential ecological risk indices showed low ecological risk for the water body. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Samples of maize, teff, red pepper, and coffee (green bean and coffee bean with pulp) were collected from a local market in the Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. Samples were analyzed for the occurrence of cypermethrin, permethrin, deltamethrin, chlorpyrifos ethyl, DTT and its metabolites, and endosulfan (α, β). In the analytical procedure, the QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) extraction methodology with dispersive solid phase extraction clean up (d-SPE) technique was applied. Validation of the QuEChERS method was satisfactory. Recovery percentages of most pesticides were in the range of 70% to 120%, with good repeatability (%relative standard deviation<20). The limit of detection and limit of quantification varied between 0.001μg/g and 0.092μg/g and between 0.002μg/g and 0.307μg/g, respectively. The main pesticides detected were DDT, endosulfan, cypermethrin, and permethrin. All of the pesticides analyzed were detected in red pepper and green coffee bean. Residues of DDT in coffee pulp significantly differed (p<0.01) from other food items except for red pepper. The concentration of pesticides in the food items varied from 0.011mg/kg to 1.115mg/kg. All food items contained 1 or more pesticides. Two-thirds of the samples had residues below corresponding maximum residue limits, and the remaining one-third of samples were above the maximum residue limits. These results indicate the need for a good pesticide monitoring program to evaluate consumer risk for the Ethiopian people. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:1294-1302. © 2014 SETAC.

N2  - Background: Interventions to prevent childhood illnesses are important components of the Ethiopian Health Extension Program (HEP). Although the HEP was designed to reduce inequities in access to health care, there is little evidence on equitability of preventive interventions in Ethiopia. Purpose: This article describes coverage of preventive interventions and how many interventions individual children received. We also examined which factors were associated with the number of preventive interventions received, and assessed the extent to which interventions were equitably distributed. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 3,200 randomly selected households in the rural Jimma and West Hararghe Zones of Ethiopia's Oromia Region. We calculated coverage of 10 preventive interventions and a composite of eight interventions (co-coverage) representing the number of interventions received by children. Multiple linear regressions were used to assess associations between co-coverage and explanatory variables. Finally, we assessed the equitability of preventive interventions by comparing coverage among children in the poorest and the least poor wealth quintiles. Results: Coverage was less than 50% for six of the 10 interventions. Children received on average only three of the eight interventions included in the co-coverage calculation. Zone, gender, caretaker age, religion, and household wealth were all significantly associated with co-coverage, controlling for key covariates. Exclusive breastfeeding, vaccine uptake, and vitamin A supplementation were all relatively equitable. On the other hand, coverage of insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying (ITN/IRS) and access to safe water were significantly higher among the least poor children compared to children in the poorest quintile. Conclusion: Coverage of key interventions to prevent childhood illnesses is generally low in Jimma and West Hararghe. Although a number of interventions were equitably distributed, there were marked wealth-based inequities for interventions that are possessed at the household level, even among relatively homogeneous rural communities.

N2  - The efficacy of Millettia ferruginea, Melia azedarach, Schinus molle and Tephrosia vogelii against the sweet potato weevil, Cylas puncticollis (Boheman) was evaluated under laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions in Wolaita, Southern Ethiopia. In the laboratory study, 10% w/v of seed water extract of Millettia ferruginea (Hochest) caused 100% adult weevil mortality within three days and was the best as compared to M. azedarach, S. molle and T. vogelii treatments. There was no significant difference between the synthetic insecticide, diazinon 60% EC, and M. ferruginea seed water extract. Under greenhouse conditions M. ferruginea at similar level of treatment reduced sweet potato weevils in sweet potato vines and tubers from the plots sprayed three times. The marketable tuber yields from the field experiment were 11.25, 6.65, 6.91 and 1.80 tonnes/ha for three and two times foliar application, three times drenching, and control, respectively. However, the insecticide diazinon 60% EC treatment was significantly better than all the M. ferruginea treatments in reducing the number of sweet potato weevils and increasing marketable root tuber yield. Net profits of 19,372, 12,988, and 6,584 birr/ha were obtained from the plots treated with diazinon 60% EC, three times foliar application, and two times foliar application of M. ferruginea seed water extract, respectively. Frequent foliar applications of M. ferruginea seed water extract resulted in higher profits than the untreated control and drenching treatments. Resource poor farmers of Ethiopia, therefore, can use M. ferruginea seed water extract for the management of C. puncticollis.

N2  - This review summarizes studies carried out on pea aphids, Acyrtosiphon pisum (Harris) (Aphididae: Homoptera) damaging food legumes in northwestern Ethiopia (much of the high plateau of the country is found here, over 2000 m above sea level) from 1998 to 2013. The review summarizes of various papers on pea aphids published in the area of wild legumes, aphid reproduction and survival, population dynamics, suitable weather conditions, host preference and evaluation of eco-friendly botanical products against aphids. During the initial studies, we tried to identify how aphids over winter the rather long (9-month) dry season. It was found that wild leguminous plants such as clover, Trifolium ruepellainum and vetch, Vicia spp and the cultivated ones such as the perennial legumes (pigeon pea, Cajanus cajan) served as wild hosts. These are believed to sustain aphid survival during the dry season. In the greenhouse study, it was determined that the more the aphid density the lower the rate of reproduction and the longevity of aphids. Aphid population dynamics studies also showed that aphids prefer cool and dry climate, nevertheless warm episodes are necessary for reproduction. Lower altitudes are therefore found good hot-spots for the aphids. Our research station (Adet Research Center, Amhara, Ethiopia) is located at 2240 m a.s.l. where the aphids are less important while 45 km north the altitude descends 400 m lower than our station, gets warmer and grass pea production has almost stopped there because of these aphids. Aphid numbers steadily increased from seedling stage to pod setting, and then drastically fell at maturity. Lentils and grass peas were more suitable hosts than faba bean and field pea. In Ethiopia, pea aphids were first reported in cool and dry regions of the extreme north, which later extended their range to even lower altitudes and warmer areas. Management studies carried out include botanicals, detergents, kerosene and some of the more conventional and aphid-specific pesticides. Promising botanicals included spray of capsicum juice, kerosene (despite its phytotoxicity) and detergents. Parasitism of aphids by Aphidius species and predation by coccinellid larvae and adults was high but they came late long after damage was inflicted to the crop. The series of studies carried out over the years helped to determine the status of the pest in the area and point out some of the environmentally safe management options. Planting susceptible legumes may have to be limited to places where the aphid is not endemic or better use aphid- specific pesticides (such as pirimicarb). Spraying alternate hosts during the off-season to break the cycle of infestation, determining the rate and frequency of botanicals such as capsicum, and ensuring the survival of coccinellids and aphid parasitoids during the offseason can be the next research agenda.

N2  - Background: The presence of pollutants in honey can influence honey bee colony performance and devalue its use for human consumption. Using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), various clean-up methods were evaluated for efficient determination of multiclass pesticide contaminants in honey. The selected clean-up method was optimized and validated and then applied to perform a preliminary study of commercial honey samples from Africa. Results: The most efficient method was primary-secondary amine (PSA) sorbent which was significantly different from the others (P <0.05; average recovery ~94 %) and was applied to analyze 96 pesticide residues in 28 retail honey samples from Kenya and Ethiopia. From our preliminary data, a total of 17 pesticide residues were detected at ~10-fold below maximum residue limit (MRL) established for food products except for malathion which was detected at almost 2-fold above its acceptable MRL. Conclusions: A highly efficient approach for determining pesticide residues in honey with good recoveries was developed. All residue contaminants were detected at levels well below their acceptable MRLs except malathion suggesting that the retail honey analyzed is safe for human consumption. Although PSA clean-up method was selected as the most efficient for cleaning honey samples, omitting the clean-up step was the most economical approach with potential applicability in the food industry.

N2  - Improved potato varieties can increase potato yields of smallholders, and thus contribute to food security improvement in Ethiopia. However, the uptake of these varieties by farmers is very limited so far and this is one of the causes of insufficient seed quality in the seed potato system in Ethiopia. The low uptake may be related to the high costs of recommended production methods for these varieties. The objective of this study was to formulate least-cost seed potato production methods for farmers in Ethiopia. The paper used integer linear programming to determine these least-cost seed potato production methods, using published data on the perceived contributions to seed tuber yield and quality of different cultivation and post-harvest management options, and calculated seed potato production cost data for the different options. For the potato-growing districts Jeldu and Welmera, several seed potato production methods were formulated from which farmers can choose an affordable method that will enable them to produce seed potato with reasonable yield and quality levels. Results showed that yield and quality levels could be simultaneously improved at relatively low extra costs, for example, by applying recommended fertilizer rate combined with two fungicide applications. In both districts, most methods were robust to 50% increases in the rental values of land, prices of seed, wage rates, and prices of agrochemicals. Findings can be used by potato development practitioners to advise farmers on the adoption of seed potato technologies that are compatible with their financial resources.

N2  - To promote pesticide governance that protects the environment and human health, Ethiopia has developed a legal framework for pesticide registration and control. However, in Ethiopia, pesticides are still registered, traded and used inappropriately. This research analyses how Ethiopia's pesticide policy is implemented and identifies the barriers for an effective implementation of this policy. With a theoretical framework based on the information, motivations and resources of relevant actors, data are collected from state pesticide experts, traders and end users (farmers) through in-depth interviews. The overall result reveals that major gaps exist between pesticides policy on paper and its implementation in practice. The key policy actors scored low on each of the three characteristics: they have poor information available, have low motivation to implement policies and lack sufficient resources. Involvement of and collaboration with private actors is likely to improve the implementation of pesticide governance, and contribute to sustainability in agricultural and food systems in Ethiopia.

N2  - Background: Camel mange is an economically important parasitic disease affecting productivity in camel rearing areas of the world if appropriate treatment is not instituted. Methods: A cross-sectional and a controlled field trial were carried out to study the epidemiology of camel mange in Fafan zone, Eastern Ethiopia, and evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin and diazinon in the control of mange infestation in camels on the basis of clinical and parasitological evidence, respectively. Three groups of naturally infested camels and one group of healthy camels each composed of 6 individuals were enrolled: the two infested groups received either ivermectin or diazinon, and the other groups remained untreated. Results: The overall prevalence rate of mange in camels in the study area was 31.5 % and the only identified species was Sarcoptes scabiei. The prevalence rate was found to significantly vary (p < 0.05) in relation to body condition and herd size of camels. Both drugs showed significant variation (p < 0.05) on improving clinical and body condition scores. Clearance of mange lesions occurred with both drugs; however, re-infestation was observed in diazinon treated group. Ivermectin significantly improved (p < 0.05) both body condition and clinical scores whereas diazinon markedly improved only the later. Conclusion: In conclusion, camels in the study area harbored considerable level of S. scabiei which warrants institution of an integrated control approach by administration of ivermectin while also sanitating the animal environment.

N2  - Pesticides are often used to manage pests and diseases to enhance agricultural productivity. However, pesticides have negative impacts on human and animal health as well as on the environment if not properly used and handled. Hence, this study aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitude and practices of smallholder farmers in agricultural pesticides utilization in three major cereal producing districts of Jimma zone, Ethiopia. For the study original data collected from 140 randomly selected farmers using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and key informant interviews with district level experts were used. The results showed that 98% of the sample households use pesticides; of which 45% purchase pesticides from open market. Furthermore, while the herbicide 2, 4-D was used by 57% of the households, 48% of the respondents did not know the type of pesticides they used. Only 30% read the instructions and less than 40% understand the signs on pesticide containers. Most households perceived that pesticides are useful; however, 98.5% of them witnessed its negative effects. Some health related discomforts reported include nausea, vomiting, headache, and skin irritation with the respective shares of 68%, 18%, 12% and 2%. Ninety five percent of the respondents believed that it is possible to minimize the negative effects of pesticides. But, 80% use normal clothes for spraying pesticides; 40% wash spray equipments in yard; 23% throw pesticide containers in open field and 32% reuse pesticide containers for other purposes. Findings of the study revealed that there is mismatch among knowledge, perception and practice of the farmers. Hence, it is important to carefully design pesticides supply chain and train farmers to create awareness about the careful use of pesticide, and disposal of the leftover and containers.

N2  - Chemical pesticides, regardless of their inherent hazard, are used intensively in the fast changing agricultural sector of Ethiopia. We conducted a cross-sectional pesticide Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey among 601 farmers and farm workers (applicators and re-entry workers) in three farming systems [large-scale closed greenhouses (LSGH), large-scale open farms (LSOF), and small-scale irrigated farms (SSIF)]. Main observations were that 85% of workers did not attain any pesticide-related training, 81% were not aware of modern alternatives for chemical pesticides, 10% used a full set of personal protective equipment, and 62% did not usually bath or shower after work. Among applicators pesticide training attendance was highest in LSGH (35%) and was lowest in SSIF (4%). None of the female re-entry farm workers had received pesticide-related training. Personal protective equipment use was twice as high among pesticide applicators as among re-entry workers (13 versus 7%), while none of the small-scale farm workers used personal protection equipment. Stockpiling and burial of empty pesticide containers and discarding empty pesticide containers in farming fields were reported in both LSOF and by 75% of the farm workers in SSIF. Considerable increment in chemical pesticide usage intensity, illegitimate usages of DDT and Endosulfan on food crops and direct import of pesticides without the formal Ethiopian registration process were also indicated. These results point out a general lack of training and knowledge regarding the safe use of pesticides in all farming systems but especially among small-scale farmers. This in combination with the increase in chemical pesticide usage in the past decade likely results in occupational and environmental health risks. Improved KAP that account for institutional difference among various farming systems and enforcement of regulatory measures including the available occupational and environmental proclamations in Ethiopia are urgently needed.

N2  - Objective: To develop an inexpensive and easily adaptable semi-quantitative exposure assessment method to characterize exposure to pesticide in applicators and re-entry farmers and farm workers in Ethiopia. Methods: Two specific semi-quantitative exposure algorithms for pesticides applicators and re-entry workers were developed and applied to 601 farm workers employed in 3 distinctly different farming systems [small-scale irrigated, large-scale greenhouses (LSGH), and large-scale open (LSO)] in Ethiopia. The algorithm for applicators was based on exposure-modifying factors including application methods, farm layout (open or closed), pesticide mixing conditions, cleaning of spraying equipment, intensity of pesticide application per day, utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE), personal hygienic behavior, annual frequency of application, and duration of employment at the farm. The algorithm for re-entry work was based on an expert-based re-entry exposure intensity score, utilization of PPE, personal hygienic behavior, annual frequency of re-entry work, and duration of employment at the farm. Results: The algorithms allowed estimation of daily, annual and cumulative lifetime exposure for applicators, and re-entry workers by farming system, by gender, and by age group. For all metrics, highest exposures occurred in LSGH for both applicators and female re-entry workers. For male re-entry workers, highest cumulative exposure occurred in LSO farms. Female re-entry workers appeared to be higher exposed on a daily or annual basis than male re-entry workers, but their cumulative exposures were similar due to the fact that on average males had longer tenure. Factors related to intensity of exposure (like application method and farm layout) were indicated as the main driving factors for estimated potential exposure. Use of personal protection, hygienic behavior, and duration of employment in surveyed farm workers contributed less to the contrast in exposure estimates. Conclusions: This study indicated that farmers' and farm workers' exposure to pesticides can be inexpensively characterized, ranked, and classified. Our method could be extended to assess exposure to specific active ingredients provided that detailed information on pesticides used is available. The resulting exposure estimates will consequently be used in occupational epidemiology studies in Ethiopia and other similar countries with few resources.

N2  - Background In Ethiopia, pesticides are widely used for a variety of purposes. The occurrence of contamination and poisoning for farmers is highly reported due to unsafe handling practices and their usage. We assessed knowledge, attitudes and experiences of previous pesticide exposure, and related health problems among farmers who use irrigation in Jimma Zone, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross-sectional study was conducted among farmers living in the zone. Respondents were 796 irrigation farmers from 20 kebeles (lowest administration unit) in Jimma Zone. Data were collected using a pretested and structured questionnaire via faceto-face interviews. Both descriptive and inferential statistics analysis were performed. A binary logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with attitudes of farmers towards the safe use of pesticides at P value of ô 0.05 in the final model. Results Among the participants, 54.4% (95%CI, 50.7-58%) knew at least one pesticide control method and 53.7% had positive attitudes towards safe use of pesticide. The mean score of attitudes was found to be 3.9(±0.4). Knowledge including each of the following: the names of the pesticides (AOR, 0.41; 95%CI, 0.25-0.67), methods of pest control and the use of gloves during pesticide exposure (AOR, 1.52; 95%CI, 1.07-2.16) was found to be independent predictor of the farmers' attitudes about safe use of pesticides. Past exposure of pesticide was reported by 89.6% of farmers. Participants reported ingestion (88.9%) and inhalation (90.4%) as possible mechanisms of pesticide exposure. Nearly 42% of farmers had never used any personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect themselves against pesticide exposure. Farmers reported several health complications, which were perceived as complications of pesticide exposure, including: headache, nausea and vomiting, skin rash and irritation and abdominal pain. Conclusions The study exposed the existence of high probability of pesticide exposure, the low safe use of pesticide and the low use of PPE. However, but farmers had positive attitudes towards safe use of pesticides. These findings appeal for the development of effective public health strategies to improve farmers' awareness and safe use of PPE. In addition, there is a need to inform farmers about integrated pest management to prevent severe health complications, which may occur as a result of unsafe and inappropriate use of pesticides.

N2  - Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium L.) is known by several common names, such as pennyroyal, mint, and poleo. Pennyroyal is native to Ireland, across southern and central Europe, and in the Ukraine (Tutin et al. 1976). A European folk name for the plant is “grows-in-the-ditch” (Polonin 1969). Repeatedly introduced in North America since European settlement, pennyroyal is now found naturalized in wildlands throughout the world (Grieve, 1959). These plants also thrive in Asia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Brazil, Tunisia, 418and Portugal. This plant also grows spontaneously in humid parts of Iran. The worth of Mentha is evident, as its essential oils (EOs) and dried and fresh plant material are in daily use in confectionary, beverages, bakeries, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides (Shaikh et al., 2014). Essential oils of this herb have been used in traditional medicine in many countries. The oils are also reported to have potential for use to prevent oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and increase a product’s shelf life. Pennyroyal is a good alternative for synthetic antioxidants and is used as flavors in many foods. Besides food products, pennyroyal essential oils can be used in detergents and soaps, dental products, and insect and tick repellent agents.

N2  - Organic pollutants in the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lakes are the major factors that contribute to severe environmental problem. SPMDs were deployed for the analysis of selected organic pollutants for 1 month at 2 sites in Lakes Hawassa, Ziway and Koka, Ethiopia. From SPMDs placed in the three lakes, the predominant OCPs were DDT which comprise 67% and followed by endosulfan 23% of the total organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) retrieved. The highest level of OCPs, in general, was found in the SPMDs deployed in Lake Ziway with the mean concentration of 308.5 ng/SPMD. However, the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were the highest in the SPMDs deployed in Lake Hawassa with mean concentration of 50.2 ng/SPMD. Spatial variation on the accumulation of OCPs and PCBs among the lakes depends on the shoreline activities, distance of the lakes from point and non-point sources, and the biofouling factors.

N2  - Rationale: In the last decade, due to expansion of greenhouses and irrigated farms, the use of pesticides in Ethiopia has increased 6-13-fold leading to potential health risks. Objective: To investigate if occupational exposure to pesticides is associated with respiratory health effects in farmers and farm workers from commercial farming systems. Methods: We performed two cross-sectional surveys comprising different farming systems. In the first survey we studied respiratory symptoms among 1104 subjects of which 601 were occupationally exposed to pesticides (ie, 256 pesticide applicators, 345 re-entry workers) and 503 unexposed individuals. The second survey, carried out 2 years later in the same farming regions, additionally included lung function measurement and comprised a total of 387 study subjects of which 206 were occupationally exposed to pesticides (142 applicators and 64 re-entry workers) and 180 unexposed individuals. Results: We observed increased risks for chronic cough and shortness of breath (OR=3.15, 95% CI 1.56 to 6.36 and OR=6.67, 95% CI 2.60 to 17.58) among the exposed subjects as compared with unexposed individuals in the first survey. These results were corroborated in the second survey where we also observed reductions in FEV1 (140 mL), forced expiratory flow 25%-75% (550 mL/s) and risk of FEV1/FVC ratio <0.8 (OR=4.31, 95% CI 2.11 to 8.81) among pesticide exposed workers. Conclusions These findings indicate an increased risk of adverse respiratory health among workers exposed to pesticides. As those effects occurred in young workers (mean age 27 years) and within a relative short duration of exposure (4 years) implementation of stringent occupational health measures are warranted.

N2  - Khat (Catha edulis) is one of the most consumed plant in the horn of African countries. However, it is a stimulant plant that has several side effects on the health of consumers. On top of that, the khat leaves used for human consumption are often contain contaminants such as pesticide residues. The present study aims to investigate the level of DDT residue and its metabolites (p'p-DDE, p'p-DDD, o'p-DDT and p'p-DDT) in khat samples and to undertake exposure assessment to consumers. The khat samples were collected from local markets in southwestern Ethiopia. Consumption survey was undertaken using 24 h recall method for both male and female khat consumers. The finding showed that 80% of the khat samples contained DDT and its metabolites. Some of the residues were above the maximum residue limit (MRL) set by Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). The concentration of p'p-DDE and p'p-DDT in khat were in the range of 0.033–0.113 and 0.010–0.026 mg/kg, respectively. High concentration of the metabolite (p'p-DDE) compared to the parent compound (p'p-DDT) revealed the historical use of DDT in the study area. Probabilistic exposure analysis indicated that the mean and 97.5 percentile (P97.5), of the estimated daily intake of total DDT were 0.002 and 0.006 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The study concluded that khat consumers are exposed to the stimulant effect of the plant as well as DDT and its metabolites in Jimma zone.

N2  - To evaluate the effective impact of Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) on berry loss in the smallholder context of SW Ethiopia, CBD symptoms were monitored during the rainy seasons of two consecutive years on both protected (with fungicide applications) and unprotected coffee branches. Fungicide applications (mancozeb) had significant effect (P < 4e-05) on the proportion of necrotic and dropped berries; CBD necrotic symptom was reduced from 48.7% (non treated) to zero (treated) while berry drop was reduced from 52.8% (non treated) to 40.8% (treated), suggesting that only 12.1% of the observed berry loss could certainly be attributed to CBD. Disease incidence was not influenced by the branch position in the canopy of the monitored trees. Altitude was an important factor controlling the disease incidence as it favored the development of both necrotic and drop symptoms. The result suggests that non-CBD factors controlling the physiology of berry production, such as plant age, pruning or soil fertilization, climate are predominant in the studied context to explain yield loss, and that berry drop symptom assessment alone may lead to an overestimation of CBD impact.

N2  - Soil erosion and degradation is an important agro-ecological challenge in the highlands of Ethiopia. Conservation agriculture (CA) has a long time been identified as one of the key interventions that could abate the current trend of physical and chemical erosion of soil. This study analyzed adoption of the different components of CA (minimal disturbance of soil, permanent organic soil cover, and crop rotation) and herbicide application in two districts of Ethiopia using a multivariate probit model. The impact of CA on land and labor productivity was also estimated using generalized methods of moments and the control function approach. The initial decision to adopt the different components of CA is influenced by location, family size, access to extension, and formal education. Among the components introduced with CA, herbicide application significantly and strongly influences land productivity. Other factors, which influenced land productivity, were location, sex of head of household, livestock wealth, and human labor endowment. None of the components of CA—including the complementary herbicide application—was found to be influencing labor productivity in the study areas. Generally, access to extension and the main crop under production drive the decision to adopt or not to adopt the different components of CA. Despite its positive impact on land productivity, herbicide application should be further investigated with attention to its effect on sustainable use of cultivable land.

N2  - This study analyses the economics of conservation tillage (CT) with respect to its effect on maize yield and chemical fertiliser, herbicide, and female and male labour demand. We estimate production and input demand functions using seemingly unrelated regressions on plot-level cross-sectional farm household data collected in the north-west of Ethiopia. A two-step control function is applied to address potential endogeneity bias due to the inclusion of the CT adoption decision as an explanatory variable. Our results show that CT increases maize yield and chemical fertiliser demand. Additionally, the results show that the adoption of CT reduces female and male labour required for crop production. However, this is achieved through the increased use of herbicides, which might have an undesirable health and environmental effects.

N2  - The international cut flower industry is strongly criticized because of its environmental impacts and unsafe working conditions. Increasing certification of cut flowers is used to improve the growers’ environmental and social performance. But what is the impact of this private governance instrument on regulating the use of pesticides? This paper assesses the potential of private certification on governing the environmental and social problems from pesticide use along the global cut flower supply chain. We use detailed farm-level data to analyse the environmental and social impacts of flower certification in Ethiopia by comparing different national and international certification schemes. Our analysis does not show significant differences between these different private standards for most environmental and health and safety variables. The Ethiopian cut flower industry remains far from improving its sustainability performance through private certification. However, certification schemes may enable farmers to have access to international markets and keep up their reputation.

N2  - This chapter discusses research on smallholder farmers’ adoption of sustainable systems of agricultural intensification, in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and Tanzania. The research shows that adoption of a package, or system, usually results in a greater increase in productivity than adoption of individual practices. Such packages often include purchased inputs, such as chemical fertilizer and improved seeds. These inputs have proven benefits in improving yield and income, but they are costly to credit-constrained farmers. In addition, agrochemicals, including fertilizer and pesticides, have environmental effects. The quantities of such inputs that a farmer uses can be managed as part of a sustainable intensification system. Further, sustainable systems may include inputs that do not have to be purchased (e.g., manure, crop residue, local materials, and household labor). These studies note that appropriate adaptation varies greatly depending on farm-level and agroecological conditions. A review of barriers to adoption, such as risk and credit, shows that strengthening local institutions, social and human capital, and tenure security can help farmers adapt. For example, local institutions offer information, labor, credit, and risk-sharing mechanisms. Regarding education, extension is a main source of information and inputs, so quality and quantity of extension, and access via roads, can promote adaptation. As for general education, a (female) spouse’s education can increase the probability of adoption. The findings about credit, roads, and education show that agricultural adaptation is tied to overall development.

N2  - The area around Lake Ziway in Ethiopia is going through a major agricultural transformation with both small-scale farmers and large horticultural companies using pesticides and fertilisers at an increased rate. To be able to understand how this influences the water quality of Lake Ziway, water quality data was gathered to study the dynamics of pesticide concentrations and physicochemical parameters for the years from 2009 to 2015. Results indicate that for some physicochemical parameters, including pH, potassium and iron, over 50 % of the values were above the maximum permissible limit of the Ethiopian standard for drinking water. The fungicide spiroxamine poses a high chronic risk when the water is used for drinking water, while the estimated intake of diazinon was approximately 50 % of the acceptable daily intake. Higher-tier risk assessment indicated that the fungicide spiroxamine poses a high acute risk to aquatic organisms, while possible acute risks were indicated for the insecticides deltamethrin and endosulfan. Longer-term monitoring needs to be established to show the water quality changes across time and space, and the current study can be used as a baseline measurement for further research in the area as well as an example for other surface water systems in Ethiopia and Africa.

N2  - The common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris L., is one of the most important sources of protein in Ethiopia and other developing countries. However, the Mexican bean weevil, Zabrotes subfasciatus (Boheman), is a major constraint of stored common bean that causes qualitative and quantitative losses. This study was conducted to assess farmers' knowledge and perceptions of Mexican bean weevil, to examine farmers' pest management practices, and to identify challenges of pest management practices to develop integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. A survey of 148 smallholder common bean farmers was conducted at Mareka and Loma districts in southern Ethiopia. The majority (75%) of the farmers stored common bean in polypropylene bags while less than 10% of the farmers stored beans in 'Diya' (a traditional storage structure). Most (60.8%) farmers stored their beans in seed (threshed) form, and the majority (63.5%) of them stored their beans for 3-5 months. The majority of the farmers had knowledge about the Mexican bean weevil; they could identify damaged seeds based on the 'holes' on the seed (72.3%) and circular 'windows' on the seed (20.0%). About 45% of the farmers mentioned the high amount of loss at the time of storage. In addition, most farmers (53.4%) estimated 26-50% loss in storage. Most farmers reported the use of pesticidal plants for control of Mexican bean weevil, while only a few farmers reported they had applied insecticide in their store. Education level and family size had a positive and statistically significant impact on the use of pesticidal plants for the control of Mexican bean weevil. Furthermore, education level also influences the use of chemical insecticide. Results highlighted the need to use improved storage technology and to train farmers in postharvest handling practices as a component to develop IPM approach in order to minimize losses occurring along the value chains of the common bean.

N2  - Background: Sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is one of the most important crops in Ethiopia for international market, while its production is challenged by insect infestations and inappropriate agronomic practices. Sesame webworm (Antigastra catalaunalis) is the major pest, which causes heavy losses in Humera areas, Northern Ethiopia. This study aims to determine optimum sowing time and insecticide application frequency for controlling A. catalaunalis. Results: The results showed that the early sowing gave minimum infestation of sesame webworm and better sesame grain yield. The integration of early sowing and weekly spray (T16) resulted in low incidence (8.8%) and higher grain yield (651 kg/ha), where the combination of late sowing and untreated (control) plot (T3) gave higher incidence (100%) and lower grain yield (69.1 kg/ha). The maximum level of leaf, flower and capsule damage was scored on the late sowing and untreated plot, while the lowest was in the early sowing and weekly sprayed plot. Conclusions: Planting sesame early on the onset of rainfall followed with two application of insecticide at 2 and 4 weeks after emergence was found economical and optimum management option for controlling A. catalaunalis.

N2  - In the lowlands of arid and semiarid rangelands woody plants plays an important role in soil fertility maintenance, providing food, medicine, cosmetics, fodder, fuel wood and pesticides. A better understanding of the interaction of woody plants on their immediate environment is needed to guide optimum management of native vegetation in the production landscapes. However, the response of herbaceous vegetation to woody plant species remains poorly understood. This study evaluates the impact of two dominant woody plant species (Acacia Senegal and Balanite aegyptica) on herbaceous vegetation in rangelands of eastern Ethiopia. Eighteen trees of relatively the same diameter at breast height were selected to study the effect of the tree on herbaceous vegetation. Vegetation sample data were collected from under canopy and open areas, and analysed for herbaceous vegetation parameters using two ways ANOVA. The herbaceous vegetation parameters under both woody plant species was significantly higher especially with regard to dry matter (101.3±0.97g/m2), basal cover (65.02±0.7%) and species richness (6.9±0.1211 no. species/m2) than the open grassland with dry matter (74.2±0.72g/m2), basal cover (50.53±0.67%) and species richness (5.3±0.11 no. species/m2). The species composition of herbaceous species also showed significant improvements under woody plant canopy with regard to percentage composition of perennial grasses (0.40%) than the open grassland with percentage composition of perennial grasses (0.27%). The positive effect woody plant presence can be also ascribed to some understory species such as Cenchrus ciliaris, Panicum maximum and Eragrostis papposa which have a good pastoral value, grow better under woody plants. Presence of woody plants facilitates the establishment of more palatable herbaceous vegetation under unfavorable climatic conditions that characterize these environments. Therefore, this tree has a significant effect on herbaceous vegetation improvement in resource poor rangelands and as a result, it is important to retain scattered A. Senegal and B. aegyptica plants in the rangelands of eastern Ethiopia.

N2  - Background There has been a noticeable increase in the prevalence of allergy-related disorders (ARDs) in the modern era. Urbanization is believed to be a major environmental risk factor for the onset of ARDs but data from low- to middle-income countries is limited. Objective Our purpose was to assess the prevalence of ARDs and atopy among a population of rural Ethiopian school children and identify environmental and lifestyle factors associated with such disorders. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study on 541 school-children. An interviewer-led questionnaire administered to the mothers of each participant provided information on demographic and lifestyle variables. Questions on allergic disease symptoms were based on the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) core allergy and environmental questionnaire. Skin prick test for common allergens German cockroach (Blattella germanica) and dust mite (Dermatophagoides) was performed to define atopy. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the odds ratio between ARDs and atopy with specific environmental and lifestyle habits. Results 541 children responded to the survey questions: the majority of participants were female (60.3%) and aged 10±15 years-old. The prevalence of any ARD was 27%, while the rates of ever-having eczema, rhinitis, and wheeze was found to be 16.8%, 9.6%, and 8.6% respectively. Only 3.6% (19 school-children) tested positive for any skin sensitization. Analysis of associated factors for ARDs found that a family history of allergic disorders (AOR: 2.80; pvalue< 0.01), use of insecticides (AOR: 2.05; p-value<0.01), and wearing open-toed shoes (AOR: 2.19; p-value = 0.02) were all significantly associated factors. Insecticide use, riverbathing, and infection with intestinal parasites were found to be significantly associated factors for atopy. Other potential risk factors such as frequent use of soap, bacterial infection, and household crowding had no statistical significance. Conclusion Our study suggests that the prevalence of skin sensitization and ARDs in rural populations of developing countries is still relatively low. We identified several possible risk factors for further investigation. Overall, the significance of identified risk factors appears to indicate that genetic predisposition and exposure to environmental pollution are more important to the etiology of ARDs and atopy than specific lifestyle behaviors.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the larvicidal activity of physic nut, Jatropha curcas L. seed extracts against Chilo partellus larvae, which is an exotic insect causing high grain yield losses of sorghum in Ethiopia. The physic nut seed powder was extracted with methanol, ethanol, n-hexane, acetone, petroleum ether, and water. Each crude extract was tested for larvicidal effect against third instar larvae. Data on larval mortality at different intervals after exposure were recorded. Absolute larval mortality (100%) was recorded after the application of seed extracts obtained in ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether, and n-hexane solvents after the larvae were exposed for a period of 34-75 min. Methanol and water extracts were slow acting and to obtain similar mortality of the larvae 115 and 258 min were required to kill all the larvae, respectively. Duration of exposure was significantly correlated with larval kill, like seed extract prepared in ethanol, petroleum ether, and acetone caused larval mortality of 13-20, 53.3%, and 33.3%, respectively, after 15-60 min of exposure. The results suggest that crude extracts of J. curcas have potential toxicity against C. partellus larvae and can be taken for large scale study under field condition to obtain an environmental-friendly biopesticide for poor farmer community in Ethiopia.

N2  - This paper reviews the role and economic importance of the pollination service by honey bees (Apis mellifera) to agricultural crops and food security in the Ethiopian context. Honey bees provide pollination services that are crucial for sexual reproduction and improving the quality and quantity of many agricultural crops. From the significant 53 crops cultivated in Ethiopia, 33 (62.2%) of them are dependent on biological pollinators. Besides this, honey bees play a vital economic role, and their contribution to pollination service in agriculture crops is around 0.815 billion dollars in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, this contribution is unnoticed by Ethiopian farmers. Pollination by honey bee plays an essential role in human nutrition and supplies food security, income in households, and ecosystem services. Declines in insect pollinators, including honey bees across the world, have raised concerns about the supply of pollination services to agriculture, and it is because one-third of agriculture productions depend upon pollination, mainly by honey bees. Among the several factors responsible for the decline of honey bee colonies, improper pesticide application, and climate change are the elements and make them at risk. The potential adverse effects of pollinator declines include direct economic losses incurred by reduced crop yields as well as broader impacts on the agricultural activity because of lower productivity in the ecosystems. Through promoting and the use of honey bee pollination service as agricultural development packages, it is possible to improve honey bee production and crop yield in Ethiopia.

N2  - Globally, the human population is facing difficulties vis-à-vis the ability to secure a sustainable supply of water, food, and energy due to the rising number of population, urbanization, globalization, and so on. The Ethiopian government has given emphasis on sugar and ethanol production from sugarcane, which will highly increase water and energy utilization in Ethiopia. The study aims to assess the water-energy-food nexus (WEFN) in the sugarcane production sector of Ethiopia. The set of indicators considering the consumption, mass, and economic productivity of water and energy in three different sugarcane producing factories in Ethiopia (Wonji-Shoa, Metehara, and Fincha) has been applied. An integrated indicator, so-called "water-energy-food nexus index (WEFNI)," is calculated to identify and compare the WEFN performance of the study sites. The assessment results helped to understand the water-energy-sugarcane relationships. The best nexus performance was found for Wonji Shoa, which has the highest WEFNI score that is, 0.63, followed by Fincha (0.47) and Metehara (0.45). The nexus assessment showed that the higher energy use in Wonji Shoa due to the modern irrigation technology implemented can be compensated by the reduction of water loss and productivity improvement, which finally lead to the increased WEFNI score. Recommendations such as adoption of modern irrigation system and substitution of fertilizers by filter cake are made for improving the WEFN of sugarcane cultivation. This study helps producers and stakeholders to understand their management performance and take actions to improve their productivity, profit, and resource management.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world. However, as daily consumables, coffee beans may contain pesticide residues that are capable of causing adverse health effects. Thus, we investigated residue dynamics in coffee beans using supervised field trials under Good Agricultural Practice conditions and determined the effects of household coffee processing on the coffee-bean pesticide residues dinotefuran and its metabolites 1-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl) urea (UF) and 1-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-3-furylmethyl) guanidine (DN). RESULTS: The recovery rate of dinotefuran and its metabolites UF and DN was in the range 73.5%–106.3%, with a relative SD < 10%. The limits of detection and limits of quantification for dinotefuran, UF and DN were all 0.003 and 0.01 mg kg −1 , respectively. Dissipation experiments were conducted over 2015 and 2016 and showed a mean half-life of 40.8 days. Coffee processing procedures were performed as described for traditional household coffee processing in Ethiopia. Dinotefuran contents were reduced by 44.4%–86.7% with washing of coffee beans and the roasting process reduced these contents by 62.2%–100%. DN residues were not detected in roasted coffee beans before day 21 or in brewed coffee before day 35 and UF residues were not detected in brewed coffee before day 35. Kruskal–Wallis analyses indicated large variations in the stability of pesticide residues between processing methods (P ≤ 0.05). Reductions of pesticide concentrations with washing were also significantly lower than those following roasting (P = 0.0001) and brewing processes (P = 0.002). Moreover, processing factors were less than one for all processing stages, indicating reductions of pesticides contents for all processing stages. CONCLUSION: The cumulative effects of the three processing methods are of paramount importance with respect to an evaluation of the risks associated with the ingestion of pesticide residues, particularly those in coffee beans. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

Twelve treatments, untreated seed (T1), hydro-primed seed (T2), seed primed with CaCl2 (T3), seed treated with dynamic (T4), hydro-primed seed + treated with dynamic (T5), seed primed with CaCl2+ treated with dynamic (T6), seed treated with dynamic + disco (T7), hydro-primed seed + treated with dynamic + disco (T8), seed primed with CaCl2 + treated with dynamic + disco (T9), seed treated with dynamic + disco +genius coating(T10), hydro-primed seed + treated with dynamic +disco + genius coating(T11) and seed primed with CaCl2 + treated with dynamic + disco + genius coating (T12) were tested using completely randomized design (CRD) with four replications. Physiological quality data like germination percentage, root length, shoot length and vigor index were taken. Analysis of variance for all parameters was computed with SAS version 9.0 and mean separation was using the least significant difference test (LSD) at 5% and 1% level of significance. The study revealed that germination percentage, root length, shoot length and vigor index of sesame were significantly (p < 0.01) affected by seed priming and coating treatments. From this experiment, higher germination percentage (91.50%) was recorded by primed seeds with water. However, the root length (4.78 cm), shoot length (6.33 cm) and vigor index (928.48) of sesame was higher for seeds coated with dynamic + disco.

N2  - There is a recent expansion of modern agriculture in Ethiopia resulting in intensification of chemical pesticide use. Due to an inherent hazard of pesticides to the environment and human health, pesticides need to be properly used, handled and managed. Agriculture extension workers (AEWs) are supposed to give advices on pesticides hazards so as risks due to pesticide use is minimized. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was done by purposively sampling 69 AEWs in the main horticultural production districts of central eastern Ethiopia. The overall objective of the survey was assessing levels of pesticide hazard related knowledge and related practices of AEWs. More than 90% of the surveyed AEWs have a diploma or lower level of education. 26% and 29 % of the AEWs reported attaining a course and participating in an on job training in relation to pesticide hazards, respectively. 7% and 11% of the interviewed AEWs mention modern methods of pesticide controls i.e.organic farming and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, respectively. 22% of the AEWs indicate they usually give advices on pesticide hazards in general. Similarly 20% and 11% of the AEWs remarked providing advices on proper storage and disposal as well as occupational exposure prevention methods of pesticides to farmers, respectively. This study underlines a relatively lower educational level of AEWs who do not have enough pesticide hazard related knowledge and cannot or not practically advising on pesticide related hazards. AEWs should have continuous on job capacity building trainings on pesticide hazards in order to minimize environmental and occupational risks due to the intensifying chemical pesticide use in Ethiopian agriculture.

N2  - Wheat rust diseases pose one of the greatest threats to global food security, including subsistence farmers in Ethiopia. The fungal spores transmitting wheat rust are dispersed by wind and can remain infectious after dispersal over long distances. The emergence of new strains of wheat rust has exacerbated the risks of severe crop loss. We describe the construction and deployment of a near real-time early warning system (EWS) for two major wind-dispersed diseases of wheat crops in Ethiopia that combines existing environmental research infrastructures, newly developed tools and scientific expertise across multiple organisations in Ethiopia and the UK. The EWS encompasses a sophisticated framework that integrates field and mobile phone surveillance data, spore dispersal and disease environmental suitability forecasting, as well as communication to policy-makers, advisors and smallholder farmers. The system involves daily automated data flow between two continents during the wheat season in Ethiopia. The framework utilises expertise and environmental research infrastructures from within the cross-disciplinary spectrum of biology, agronomy, meteorology, computer science and telecommunications. The EWS successfully provided timely information to assist policy makers formulate decisions about allocation of limited stock of fungicide during the 2017 and 2018 wheat seasons. Wheat rust alerts and advisories were sent by short message service and reports to 10 000 development agents and approximately 275 000 smallholder farmers in Ethiopia who rely on wheat for subsistence and livelihood security. The framework represents one of the first advanced crop disease EWSs implemented in a developing country. It provides policy-makers, extension agents and farmers with timely, actionable information on priority diseases affecting a staple food crop. The framework together with the underpinning technologies are transferable to forecast wheat rusts in other regions and can be readily adapted for other wind-dispersed pests and disease of major agricultural crops.

N2  - The current status of persistent organic pollutants in Ethiopian environment is not well monitored despite the existing pollution potential from a number of sources. Water and sediment samples collected from Akaki River catchment and Aba Samuel Reservoir, Central Ethiopia were analyzed to assess the concentrations, distribution, possible sources and potential ecological risk of eight organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and seven polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Water and sediment samples were extracted by liquid-liquid and Soxhlet extraction respectively, and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The detectable OCPs and PCBs in water samples were DDT, DDE, DDD, lindane and dieldrin and PCB-28, PCB-101 and PCB-118, respectively in the rainy season. Analyzed sediment samples showed the presence of lindane in the dry and p, p’-DDT, p, p’-DDE, p, p’-DDD, α, β-endosulfan, heptachlor epoxide (B), and dieldrin in the rainy seasons. Among the indicator PCBs analyzed, sediment samples showed the presence of PCB-52, PCB-101 and PCB-118 in the dry and all indicator PCBs in the rainy seasons. Sources analysis showed that PCBs and detected OCPs were mainly from the historical input of commercial products, but there were recent discharge of DDT and lindane into the river system. Ecological risk assessment of the analyzed OCPs and PCBs using water and sediment quality guidelines indicated that lindane in the dry and p’-DDT, p, p’-DDE, p, p’-DDD, heptachlore epoxide and dieldrin in the rainy seasons in the sediment samples from Akaki river and Aba Samuel reservoir were above the limit at most of the sites. This suggests there is greater possibility of higher ecological hazards in these residues. However, the levels of total PCB concentrations and other OCPs at all sites were below the limit and thus their potential ecotoxicological risks were rather low.

N2  - Introduction: Unusual increase in the number of mothers referred to Tikur Anbassa Specialized Hospital from Eastern Shoa and Arsi zones of Oromia region of Ethiopia, with problems of severe anemia and thrombocytopenia, has been observed. Further investigation in Tikur Anbassa Specialized Hospital revealed features of megaloblastic bone marrow changes. Objective: The aim of the study was to identify potential risk factors associated with the disease in the study area. Methods: A case control study was conducted on 50 cases and 156 controls from mothers attending ANC in Adama and Assala Hospitals.. Result: Fifty cases and 156 controls participated in the study with mean (SD) age of 25.8 (±5.2) and 25.1 (±4.5), respectively. Cases were more exposed to fertilizers (AOR 7.3, 95% CI 3.6-15) and pesticides (AOR 6.2, 95% CI 2.8-13.5) than controls although specific chemicals were not identified in this study. Increased adverse maternal outcomes, including maternal deaths and perinatal mortality were observed among cases than controls. Conclusion and recommendation: Cases were more frequently exposed to pesticides and fertilizers and had poor pregnancy outcome compared to controls. This calls for further largescale study to explore potential environmental exposures, including those identified in this study and to further unravel the cause of this fatal and significant public health problem in this highly populated and industrial region of the country.

N2  - Endosulfan, a mixture of α- and β-isomers, is used by farmers in the wet and dry season for khat and onion production. Khat leaf samples were collected in farmer fields at intervals of 1 h; 1, 5, 9 and 14 d after application. The dissipation rate of α- and β-isomers and residue level in khat were compared with residue levels in onion. The extraction was done by using Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged and Safe (QuEChERS) method and analyzed by Gas Chromatography – Electron Capture Detector (GC-ECD). Greater residue α- and β-isomer endosulfan levels were found in khat compared to onion as khat leaves are sprayed repeatedly in two week. Residue levels of khat exceeded the tolerable EU limit of 0.05 mg.kg−1 for leafy vegetables and herbs. For both raw and processed onion sample α- and β-endosulfan residues level were below the tolerable of limit EU regulation for bulb vegetables (i.e. 0. 1 mg.kg−1). The mean half-life for the α-isomer of endosulfan was 3.4 d in the wet season and 3.6 d in the dry season whilst that for the β-isomer was 5.0 d and 5.4 d respectively. Both isomers dissipated fastest in the wet season under conditions of high humidity and precipitation. The β-isomer persisted longer and had a lower dissipation rate from plants surface compared to the α-isomer.

N2  - The diploid cool-season legume species, faba bean (Vicia faba L.), is one of the vital pulses for the people in the world as it maintains the sustainability of agriculture and provides nutrient-rich grains. Biotic and abiotic stresses are, however, challenging the faba bean production in many countries. The foliar diseases of faba bean are among the major constraints for the production and productivity of faba bean. Recently, a new foliar disease "Faba bean gall"caused by plant debris and soil-borne pathogen (Olpidium viciae K.) is rapidly spreading and causing high yield losses in Ethiopia. This review paper presents the distribution, impact, epidemiology, and biology of faba bean gall pathogen and principally illustrates how the application and investigation of the various diseases' management approaches such as avoiding crop residues, crop rotation, intercropping, use of elicitors to induce host resistance, use of resistant genotypes, bioagents, compost teas, plant extracts, and lastly use of chemical fungicides could be important to control the faba bean gall disease underlying in faba bean.

N2  - Background. Most traditional medicines were prepared from plant origins. These plants could be contaminated by heavy metals, pesticides, and/or toxins. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the level of heavy metals such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), and copper (Cu) in frequently used traditional herbal preparations sold in Northeast Ethiopia and to estimate their health risks associated with their daily intake. Methods. A total of 6 traditional herbal preparations were randomly collected from local herbal shops of Dessie and Kombolcha town, Northeast Ethiopia. The samples were prepared for analysis by wet digestion method using nitric acid and hydrochloric acid treatment. The accuracy of the method was analyzed by the spike recovery test. Determination of Pb, Cd, Cr, and Cu by microwave plasma atomic emission spectroscopy was made in herbal preparations traditionally used in Dessie and Kombolcha town, Northeast Ethiopia. By calculating estimated daily intake (EDI), hazard quotients (HQ), and Hazard Index (HI) of metals, the health risk associated with the consumption of the analyzed herbal preparations was also evaluated. Results. The levels of heavy metals were in the range of 3.0-3.92 mg/kg for Pb, 5.35-10.7 mg/kg for Cr, and 0.815-12.3 mg/kg for Cu. However, cadmium was not detected in any of the traditional herbal preparations. This study revealed that the level of Pb and Cu in all analyzed samples was within the WHO maximum permissible limit of 10 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, respectively. The level of Cr in all traditional herbal preparations was beyond the WHO maximum permissible limit (2 mg/kg). From the health point of view, the HQ value of Cr for KD-03 and KD-04 is greater than 1, suggesting potential health risk. Furthermore, the HI value had revealed that the consumption of KD-02, KD-03, and KD-04 samples had the potential of posing health risks to consumers over long-term consumption of herbal preparations. Conclusion. This study showed that most of the metal concentration levels in the herbal products were within the WHO maximum permissible limits. However, all samples had Cr levels above the WHO maximum permissible limit. Based on the results of this study, there would be a noncarcinogenic health risk to the consumer associated with the consumption of some herbal preparations marketed in Northeast Ethiopia.

N2  - This paper studies the practice of synthetic chemical use among farmers and its possible occurrence as residue in fish foods in North-West Ethiopia. Cross-sectional study design was carried out from January to December 2018. A multi-stage sampling technique embedded with simple random sampling was employed for the selection of sampling units. The data were collected through in-depth interviews and observations of farmers. Data entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. The results showed that farmers applied chemicals indiscriminately and inappropriately on their farm, using unsafe storage facilities, ignoring risks and safety instructions. Consequently, farmers respond that insecticides and herbicides were used up to 100% and 96.4% of their farms, respectively. Most of the farmers (80.16%) of the study area have poor attitudes and practices of pesticide usage. Multivariable analysis showed, illiterate educational level; Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 3.39; 95% CI: 1.7, 6.77; Land holders situation (AOR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.52, 2.9) has been formally not trained about pesticides usage (AOR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.06, 8.37) and not read pesticide labels (AOR = 3.69, 95%CI: 1.62, 13.64) were significantly associated with possible poor attitude and practice of pesticide contamination. We conclude that there are high possibilities of chemical residues affects fish and occurring in food products (in milk, meat, fish, vegetable and fruit) that may have a public health risk in the study area. Therefore, one health intervention is required.

N2  - Field experiment was carried at Burji, Bonke and Chencha during the 2018 cropping season to evaluate the effects of host resistance and fungicide application on yellow and stem rusts and grain yield (GY) of bread wheat. Five wheat varieties and four different fungicides were included as treatment and laid out in factorial arrangement in randomized complete block design with three replications. Significant (p ≤ 0.01) difference was observed in the magnitude of the parameters of disease and crop measured between treatments. Results showed that the mean terminal severities of yellow and stem rusts were highest at Chencha than at Burji and Bonke. Yellow and stem rust terminal severities as low as 46.41%, 40.69%, 29.22%, 28.24% and 21.74% and 43.67%, 42.54%, 40.93%, 16.07% and 17.15% were recorded on Hidase, Kubsa, Ogolcho, Wane and Shorima varieties, respectively, due to the integrated use of Tilt 250 EC, Rex® Dou and Natura 250 EW foliar applications across the three locations. Crosswise assessment revealed that the lowest area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) of yellow rust of 15.73%, 14.93%, 10.42%, 8.79% and 7.67%-days was recorded on Hidase, Kubsa, Ogolcho, Wane and Shorima varieties, respectively, and that of stem rust of 18.96%, 17.33%, 16.36%, 6.80% and 6.37%-days was registered on Kubsa, Ogolcho, Hidase, Shorima and Wane varieties, respectively, as a result of combined use of Tilt 250 EC, Rex® Dou and Natura 250 EW foliar applications. The combined effect of variety and fungicide application in addition to environmental variability exhibited pronounced effects on the epidemic development of yellow and stem rusts through their effects on disease progress rate and spike infection. Rex® Dou and Natura 250 EW fungicides in combination with all the evaluated varieties proved to be effective against the rust management and gave the higher values of yield parameters and monitory advantage over the unsprayed plots. GY loss of up to 69.64% was recorded on unsprayed plots of Ogolcho as compared to fungicide sprayed plots of other varieties evaluated. Thus, Rex® Dou and Natura 250 EW fungicides in combination with wheat variety having a different level of resistance to wheat rusts could be suggested to the farmers in the study areas and elsewhere with similar agro-ecological conditions for efficient management and optimization of the GY. Further studies have to be sought in similar and other agro-ecologies elsewhere in Ethiopia for at least two consecutive years over locations to come up with a solid recommendation.

N2  - The white mango scale insect (WMS), Aulacaspis tubercularis Newstead, 1906 is a key pest of mango in Ethiopia, which has been spreading throughout the country since its introduction in 2010. Evaluation of the efficacy of two systemic soil drenching insecticides (thiamethoxam 25 % WG and imidacloprid 35 % SC) independently, and in combination with tree management (pruning) for the control of the WMS was conducted under field conditions in western Ethiopia in two locations in 2018 and 2019. Randomized complete block designs with three replications were used for the experiments. In the first site, all treatments resulted in scale populations that were significantly lower than the control (1086 crawlers and females per leaf). Thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 12 g/tree + pruning resulted in the lowest number of the WMS after the second treatment (43.5 per leaf) followed by thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 18 g/tree + pruning, which was statistically similar. In the second site, imidacloprid 35 % SC + thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 18 g/tree + pruning, resulted in the lowest mean number of the WMS (31.1 per leaf) followed by thiamethoxam 25 % WG at 12 g/tree + pruning (61.4 per leaf). This treatment also gave the highest percentage reduction in number of the WMS compared to the WMS counting before treatment application. This study has shown that use of systemic insecticides and pruning are promising control tactics for the WMS. Cost implications and effects of the insecticides on the natural enemy complex and residual toxicity in fruits need to be evaluated.

N2  - Nowadays, Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is becoming a serious insect pest of chickpea in Ethiopia and its management has faced considerable challenges, to improve yields in many crops, in most parts of the world. This experiment was initiated with the objective to evaluate the effectiveness of Azadirachta indica and Milletia ferruginea extracts for the management of H. armigera in chickpea from July to December during 2017 and 2018 cropping season under field conditions. The results revealed that aqueous extracts of M. ferruginea and A. indica at 5% concentration either individually or in combinations at 2.5% concentration of each were more effective in reducing per plant H. armigera larval populations, pod damage with increased the subsequent yields during both cropping seasons as compared to control plot. Comparing the net cost–benefit return of each treatment, during 2017 maximum CBR was from the M. ferruginea 5% treated plot and A. indica 5% treated plots during the 2018 year. Thus, locally available botanical extracts would greatly benefit the resource-poor farmers in chickpea production. Future research attentions and considerations as a part of IPM tools, in pest management, are crucial.

N2  - While the Western World is facing an inexorable decline of its farmland biodiversity following continuous intensification of production modes, agricultural landscapes in Africa are still largely dominated by small-scale subsistence farming operated by smallholders, mostly harbouring high biodiversity. However, as most African countries are confronted to an unprecedented population growth and a rapid economic development, efforts to intensify food production are widespread, with concomitant potentially negative effects on biodiversity. We conducted a study in a highly contrasted agricultural landscape of the Ethiopian highlands comprising two distinct farming systems: large-scale farming relying on modern, combine machinery and technology (e.g. enhanced crop varieties, application of herbicides, pesticides and synthetic fertilizers) vs small-scale traditional farming. Our objective was to disentangle the effects upon avian biodiversity of the operating farming system and the extent of semi-natural habitat features in the wider landscape. We performed a model selection approach to assess habitat selection by the overall bird community as well as the wintering, endemic and open habitat species, respectively. Our results show that habitat preferences of birds in the Ethiopian highlands were mainly driven by the amount of semi-natural habitats within the landscape, with varying effects depending on the farming system itself. While large-scale farming had overall more negative effects on birds, some typical open habitat species were mostly restricted to these wide-open landscapes. Our findings thereby suggest that both farming systems could coexist as long as semi-natural habitats are preserved and agricultural management maintained in its current practices. We emphasize the urgent need to conduct further studies integrating the socio-economic aspects in order to better predict future impacts of agricultural intensification processes on African farmland biodiversity.

N2  - A survey was conducted in Chano area, Southern Ethiopia, to investigate farmers' viewpoints with regard to rodent pest problems. Farmers (n = 384) were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaire between October 2018 and January 2019. Pests were implied (51%) as the major constraints of cereal crop production followed by shifting to cash crops (20.6%), waterlogged farmlands (15.6%), infertile soils (8.6%) and insufficient rains (4.2%). Farmers experienced rodent outbreaks (83%) and identified maize (98%) as a crop most susceptible to rodent damage. Farmer suffered 23.5% average annual maize loss due to rodents. Being male (OR = 2.82, P < 0.05) and years spent in farming (OR = 1.13, P < 0.001) increased the likelihood of farmers' experience with rodent outbreaks. Seedling stage of maize was identified as the stage most susceptible to rodent damage (64.8%), followed by harvesting (19.3%) and maturity (15.9%) stages. When adjusted for other factors, a year increase in farming as an occupation decreased farmers' estimate of annual maize yield loss due to rodent damage by a coefficient of 0.04 (P < 0.05). An individual's experience (86.5%) was the major factor in deciding the type of rodent pest management. Application of rodenticides was the most frequently used (76%) rodent management method. We recommend awareness creation and extension support to the farmer community to reduce the reliance on toxic rodenticides and shift to community-based integrated rodent management approaches that would reduce the unacceptable damage levels.

N2  - Seven pesticides, profenofos, metalaxyl, λ-cyhalothrin, 4,4′-DDT, 4,4′-DDE, and α- and β-endosulfan, were determined in vegetables (tomato, onion) from 20 locations and surface waters from 12 locations in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia. Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) and solid phase extraction (SPE) methods were used for the vegetables and water, respectively. In 2.5% of the tomato samples, profenofos was detected above European maximum residue limits (MRLs), in 12.5% of the samples metalaxyl, and in 2.5% α- and β-endosulfan. In 5% of the onion samples, profenofos was detected above European MRLs, in 7.5% of the onion samples metalaxyl, and in 5% λ-cyhalothrin. In surface water, profenofos was detected at the highest concentration of 2300 μg/L in the Bulbula River, 890 μg/L near the agricultural land north of Lake Ziway (ANLZ-1), 1700 μg/L in the floriculture effluent (FE-1), and 900 μg/L in tap water at the Batu Drinking Water (BDW) supply. These results show that the levels of pesticides are in several cases substantially elevated, and emphasize the need of regular pesticide monitoring programs for surface waters and vegetables in the Ethiopian CRV.

N2  - Aquatic ecosystems contribute to human well-being by delivering ecosystem services, but their protection has been given low priority in Africa. Lake Ziway in the Ethiopian Rift Valley basin provides services including irrigation, drinking water and fish food in the region. This paper reviews the biological resources and spatio- temporal variation of water quality of the lake focussing on nutrients, metals and pesticides. Lake Ziway is under increasing agricultural and urban pressure and is exhibiting deteriorating trends in several water quality and ecological parameters. Nutrients and trace metals, including PO43−, NO3−, NH4+, Ca2+, Cu and Ni of the lake have shown increasing temporal trends in concentration. Spatially, higher values of major parameters (e.g. NO3−, NH4+, K, Na and electrical conductivity) were observed at shoreline sites near floriculture farming. The water quality of the lake exceeded guideline values for drinking water (alkalinity and Fe) and for aquatic life (NH +, Fe, Cr, Cu and Se). The recently reported pesticides in the lake possibly cause ecological and human health effect. Accordingly, agriculture and urbanisation are affecting water quality of Lake Ziway, with likely negative effects on human health and the lake ecosystem function unless appropriate interventions are taken. Our results may be useful in assessing other African lakes subject to similar anthropogenic pressures in their catchments.

N2  - Spodoptera frugiperda is considered the most severe maize pest in the world and Ethiopia as well. A survey was conducted during the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons to determine the distribution, relative importance, and the association between S. frugiperda intensity and biophysical factors. A total of 375 maize fields were surveyed during the two cropping seasons. The spatiotemporal analysis revealed that there was a 100% prevalence of the S. frugiperda with various degrees in both cropping seasons. However, significant variations were observed in the pest incidence and plant damage severity of S. frugiperda among the surveyed districts in the two seasons. There were higher pest incidence and plant damage severity in 2017 than in the 2018 cropping season. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association of S. frugiperda with biophysical factors. Higher (> 75% for both cropping seasons) S. frugiperda plant damage severity was highly associated with Denba Gofa, Zala, Arba Minch, cropping system, altitude, pest management, insecticide spray frequency, and weeding practice with variable levels of significance. Lower plant damage severity of S. frugiperda was highly associated with Burji, high intercropping, altitude, a cultural plus insecticide used in pest management, more than two times insecticide applications, and high weeding practice. The study suggests proper pest management practices should be carried out to reduce S. frugiperda damaged to the maize crop.

N2  - Introduction Human embryo is well protected in the uterus by the embryonic membrane, although teratogens may cause developmental disruptions after maternal exposure to them during early pregnancy. Most of the risk factors contributing to the development of congenital anomalies are uncertain; however, genetic factors, environmental factors and multifactorial inheritance are found to be risk factors. Regardless of their clinical importance, there are little/no studies conducted directly related to predisposing risk factors in southwestern Ethiopia. Objective The study aimed to determine the associated risk factors with congenital anomalies among newborns in southwestern Ethiopia. Methods Case—control study was conducted on newborns and their mothers in six purposively selected hospitals in southwestern Ethiopia from May 2016 to May 2018. Data was collected after evaluation of the neonates for the presence of congenital anomalies using the standard pretested checklist. The data was analyzed using SPSS version 25.0. P <0.01 was set as statistically significant. Results Risk factors such as unidentified medicinal usage in the first three months of pregnancy (AOR = 3.435; 99% CI: 2.012–5.863), exposure to pesticide (AOR = 3.926; 99% CI: 1.266–12.176), passive smoking (AOR = 4.104; 99% CI: 1.892–8.901), surface water as sources of drinking (AOR = 2.073; 99% CI: 1.221–3.519), folic acid supplementation during the early pregnancy (AOR = 0.428; 99% CI: 0.247–0.740) were significantly associated with the congenital anomalies. Conclusions In this study, risk factors such as passive smoking, exposure to pesticides, chemicals and use of surface water as a source of drinking during early pregnancy had a significant association with congenital anomalies. There is a need to continuously provide health information for the community on how to prevent and control predisposing risk factors.

To this end, this study was carried out with the objective to identify potential native Trichoderma isolates for the management of sugarcane smut. A total of 120 soil samples were collected from Kesem, Metehara, and Wonji sugarcane plantation fields. Consequently, 21 Trichoderma isolates were recovered from the samples, and in-vitro antagonist study of Trichoderma isolates against U. scitaminea was done using dual culture technique on fresh PDA. Among the native isolates, 12 of them revealed a pathogen suppression potential of >90% at 7 days after inoculation and most of them had higher pathogen suppression than the commercial isolate. However, five of the isolates were selected as potential candidates based on distinct suppression features, growth rate, and antagonistic performance. Identification of the five effective Trichoderma isolates (WI4-27, MKI2-k17, MI3-m33, WI12-25, and MKI3) was done based on macroscopic and microscopic characteristics. Thus, the isolates were identified as T. harzianum, T. asperellum, T. viride, T. viride, and T. harzianum, respectively. Accordingly, these isolates could be used as one component of integrated smut management practices once a study on compatibility with fungicides, in-vivo efficacy test against smut, and substrate selection for mass production of the isolates were commenced.

N2  - Background. There are frequent reports of unsafe pesticide use in many parts of Africa. Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa with around 80% of the population still depending on agriculture which intensively uses pesticides. A number of studies have examined pesticide-related health and environmental risks in Ethiopia. However, most of these studies have been small in scale and it is therefore challenging to get a general overview of the extent of health risks and level of environmental contamination in the country. Objectives. The aim of the present study was to synthesize and summarize contemporary knowledge on pesticide-related risks and relevant gaps in Ethiopia. Methods. An electronic database search and gathering of grey literature were done to collect information on the risks of pesticide use in Ethiopia. The electronic search was conducted using MEDLINE (via PubMed) without any publication date or language specifications. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used as guide in the creation of this review. Discussion. A synthesis of the reviewed studies showed evidence of health risks due to occupational pesticide exposure, surface water pollution with pesticides that could cause chronic health risks to the public, evidence of pesticide contamination of the environment (e.g., soil organisms, fish, bee colonies and wildlife) and local as well as international consumer risks due to pesticide residues in food items. In addition, there have been frequent reports of health and environmental hazards in association with cut-flower farms. There is also evidence of direct use of DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) on food crops and detection of DDT residues in surface water, soil and human breast milk. Those reported risks might be due to lack of knowledge among farm workers, negligence of farm owners, absence of post-registration monitoring systems and poor implementation of both national and international regulations in Ethiopia due to poor institutional capacity. Conclusions. The health and environmental risks of inappropriate use of pesticides requires action by all concerned bodies. Improved institutional arrangements for enforcement of regulations, awareness and further intervention studies could lessen the high risks of pesticide misuse. Competing Interests.

N2  - Beekeeping has been an integral part of the Ethiopian agriculture and yielding 1.3% of agricultural GDP. Hence, the study was aimed to evaluate the purpose of beekeeping and major constraints impeding beekeeping practices at Lemo District, Hadiya Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Questionnaires were organized to collect survey data. A multi-stage purposive sampling technique was used and one hundred forty respondents (140 beekeepers) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Key informant interviews and Focus group discussion to support the interpretation of the interview data. The data were organized and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance via Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Accordingly, beekeeping was mostly carried out using traditional hives. From beekeeper’s respondents 80%, are involved in beekeeping mainly for both income and household consumption. Beekeepers use income obtained from beekeeping for buying crop inputs, payment for annual land taxation, and purchase food grain. The mean honey yield of traditional log hives, transitional top-bar hives, and modern hives with frames were 5.25 ± 0.38, 7.52 ± 0.54, and 12.78 ± 0.56 kg per hive per year, respectively. The most hampering factors for honey bee production were honey bee diseases, improper pesticide application, and shortage of bee forage. The finding of this study concluded that beekeeping was mostly carried out using traditional hives. Hence, well-organized training should be given for the beekeepers to practice internal colony inspection and improved beekeeping technologies via a full package program. Efforts should be geared to alleviate constraints like honey bee diseases, improper application of pesticides, and bee forage shortage hampering beekeeping in the district.

N2  - Background: The presence of agricultural pesticide residue can cause adverse health effects.The main objective of this study was to evaluate the level of pesticides in the blood of small-scale farmers (SSFs) and associated risk factors in western Ethiopia. Methods: Across sectional study was conducted in June 2020 using 240 blood samples, 140 from the exposed small-scale farmers (ESSFs) and 100 from non-exposed small-scale farmers (NESSFs). The blood sample analysis was mad for 5 organochlorines (OCs) and 3 synthetic pyrethroids (SPs) pesticides by gas-liquid chromatography with an electron capture detector (GC-ECD) methods. Extraction, and clean up of the samples were made by using standard analytical methods. To define the relationships between the outcomes and explanatory variables, logistic regression models were used. Results: The results shows that p,p’-DDT, heptachlor and deltamethrin were the most frequently detected pesticides with 96.4%, 95%, and 100% in both ESSFs and NESSFs, respectively. The ESSFs blood samples have shown the highest mean concentrations of permethrin and p,p'-DDT(1.26 ± 0.15) and (0.28 ± 0.4) mgL−1, respectively. SSFs under the age of 40 were 21% less likely to be exposed to permethrin than those above the age of 40 (Adjusted Odd Ratio, AOR, 0.21; 95% CI: 0.1-0.44). Male SSFs were 17 times more likely to be exposed to heptachlor than females (AOR, 17.36; 95%CI: 7.34-41.09) and farmers with no formal education were 18 times more likely to be exposed to deltamethrin than those with primary schools and beyond (AOR, 18.1; 95 %CI: 4.53-72.06). Furthermore, SSFs that did not use PPE appropriately were 3.6 and 6.21 times more likely to be exposed to cypermethrin (AOR, 3.6; 95%CI: 1.94-6.54) and p,p'-DDE(AOR, 6.21; 95%CI: 3.38-11.41) blood levels than those who did, respectively. SSFs that perform different activities like eating and drinking (11%), chewing (10%), and diverse activities (8%) were more likely to be exposed to p,p′-DDT than those farmers who didn’t use pesticides. Conclusions: This study identified a high concentration p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, heptachlor, cypermethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin in the blood of small scale farmers. The older age, less education, and farmers with inappropriate PPE use are more likely exposed to pesticides.

N2  - Storage pests are the main cause of crop losses. This study was carried out to assess the status of storage insect pest infestation and evaluate the efficacy of botanicals for the management of rice weevil at Jawi District, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess storage insect pest infestation. Botanical insecticides were evaluated against Sitophilus oryzae. The treatments were arranged using completely randomized design and replicated three times. Data were collected through questionnaire and experiment and analysed using SAS version 9.0. The result of the study showed that the most important insect pests of stored sorghum were S. oryzae (57%), maize weevil 17% and other pests were 26% and 100% store infestation were recorded. The species of storage insect pests identified were rice weevil, maize weevil, angoumois grain moth, flour beetle, flat grain beetles and saw-toothed grain beetle. The average grain weight loss was 13.63%, physical grain damage 7.22%, germination speed index of 46.36% and germination percentage of 68.75% were recorded. Experimental results revealed that all treatments were exhibited significant differences in mortality rate against S. oryzae. Efficacy of botanical revealed that neem seed powder (50.70%) and garlic (53.33%) were significantly superior in efficacy against S. oryzae after 28th days of exposure. Neem leaf powder, Mexican tea, orange peel and ginger gave moderate mortality rate of 48.55, 26.11, 36.87 and 41.65, respectively, compared with the control. All botanicals have the potential F1 S. oryzae reduction effect. The highest F1 reduction was recorded in neem seed powder (73.14%), neem leaf powder (72.54%) and garlic (66.94%). The highest mean germination of 70, 63.33 and 61.33% were recorded from neem seed powder, garlic and neem leaf powder exposed seeds, respectively. Neem seed powder, garlic and neem leaf powder can be suggested as management options of S. oryzae in storage condition.

N2  - Background: Occupational skin diseases are the second leading occupational disease, accounting for almost 25% of all missed workdays. Occupational contact dermatitis (OCD) accounts for 70% to 90% of all skin disorders in the workplace. Only a few occupational epidemiology studies have looked into the prevalence and risk factors of occupation-induced dermatitis among narcotic crop farm workers around the world. Related studies in Ethiopia are even fewer. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Dirashe district of Southern Ethiopia from March 23 to April 12, 2021. Data was collected using a standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire. The history of contact dermatitis was determined using the standardized Nordic Occupational Skin Questionnaire version 2002 (NOSQ-2002). A total of 578 farm laborers took part in the study, which was conducted using a systematic random sampling. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression were used to characterize the data and identify factors associated with occupational contact dermatitis. Result: The prevalence of self-reported occupational contact dermatitis in the past 12 months among workers of large-scale Khat farms was (AOR: 67.80%, 95% CI [61.00, 76.23]). In the multivariable regression, being older (AOR: 5.51, 95% CI [1.79, 7.24]), working as a bundle binder (AOR: 5.74, 95% CI [2.12, 15.55]), not wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) (AOR: 2.50, 95% CI [1.64, 3.81]), and having poor knowledge of pesticides use, storage, and disposal methods (AOR: 2.50, 95% CI [1.64, 3.81]) were associated with occupational contact dermatitis. Conclusion: Contact dermatitis caused by work is very common among Khat farm laborers. Measures to promote safe practices and reduce exposure to hazards, such as removing expired and/or banned chemicals, purchasing alternative pesticides that meet legislative requirements, job rotation and routine training of staff on safe practices, increasing safety signage, and performing risk assessments, as well as improving the quantity and quality of institutional protective equipment supplies may thus contribute to the enhancement of safe work practices.

N2  - Sugarcane is one of the most important sugar crops grown commercially and by small-scale farmers in Ethiopia. However, production of this crop is adversely affected by biotic constraints among which sugarcane smut, caused by Sporisorium scitamineum, is one of the most important diseases. Field surveys were conducted once in eight sugar estates (Arjo, Beles, Fincha, Kesem, Kuraz, Metehara, Tendaho, and Wonji) of Ethiopia from 2017 to 2019 to determine the smut distribution, incidence, severity, and association of biophysical factors with smut incidence and severity. A total of 311 fields were assessed in eight sugar estates. Logistic regression was used to analyze the association of independent factors with smut incidence and severity. The results revealed that sugarcane smut prevailed in 62.7% of the fields. Moreover, mean smut incidence and severity varied significantly among the surveyed fields and sugar estates. High smut incidence (>5%) and severity (>25%) were highly associated with Kesem, Kuraz, Metehara, and Tendaho sugar estates; NCo 334, Natal, Mexican, and Guyana sugarcane varieties; altitude of ≤1000 m above sea level (m.a.s.l.); ratoon crop; heavy and intermediate-textured soils; and tillering growth stage. On the other hand, low smut incidence (≤5%) and severity (≤25%) had high probability of association with Cuba and Barbados sugarcane varieties; furrow irrigation; altitude of 1001–1500 m.a.s.l.; and weed-free and fertilizer applied fields. In conclusion, the presence of high intensity of sugarcane smut in most surveyed areas implies a stringent need for the development of integrated smut management that incorporates resistant varieties, fungicide and biofungicide seedcane treatment at planting, threshold information for ratooning, ecological-based varietal allocation and recommended crop husbandry for effective and efficient management of smut, and sustainable sugarcane production and productivity in the study areas. Therefore, research should give attention to the development of viable and economically feasible integrated smut management programs.

N2  - Khat (Catha edulis) chewing is widespread in the region of East Africa. Even low levels of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in khat could induce public health concern. In a market-based study, from five popular khat varieties, a total of 35 composite khat samples were analyzed for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its main transformation products, and four hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers. Extraction was carried out by quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method (QuEChERS). OCP concentrations were determined by head space solid phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME–GC–MS). Every sample contained β-HCH above the maximum residue limit set by the European Commission. For total DDT, this was the case for 25.7% of the samples. The ratios of (p,p′-DDD + p,p′-DDE) to p,p′-DDT were less than one for 85% of khat samples, demonstrating recent use of DDT in khat farmlands. Conversely, the ratio of β-HCH to total HCH varied from 0.56 to 0.96, implying historical input of technical HCH. Assuming a daily chewable portion of 100 g, dietary intakes of p,p′-DDT, total DDT and total HCH by adults ranged from 3.12 to 57.9, 6.49 to 80.2 and 39.2 to 51.9 ng (kg body weight)−1 day−1, respectively. These levels are below acceptable levels suggested by international organizations. Chewing khat showed lower non-cancer health risk, but showed relatively higher cancer risk in terms of OCPs. Because khat is chewed without being subjected to any treatment, uncertainties associated with estimated intakes and health risks should be low. Therefore, this practice is of great concern.

N2  - Since 2016, fall armyworm (FAW) has threatened sub-Saharan ‘Africa’s fragile food systems and economic performance. Yet, there is limited evidence on this transboundary pest’s economic and food security impacts in the region. Additionally, the health and environmental consequences of the insecticides being used to control FAW have not been studied. This paper presents evidence on the impacts of FAW on maize production, food security, and human and environmental health. We use a combination of an agroecology-based community survey and nationally representative data from an agricultural household survey to achieve our objectives. The results indicate that the pest causes an average annual loss of 36% in maize production, reducing 0.67 million tonnes of maize (0.225 million tonnes per year) between 2017 and 2019. The total economic loss is US$ 200 million, or 0.08% of the gross domestic product. The lost production could have met the per capita maize consumption of 4 million people. We also find that insecticides to control FAW have more significant toxic effects on the environment than on humans. This paper highlights governments and development partners need to invest in sustainable FAW control strategies to reduce maize production loss, improve food security, and protect human and environmental health.

N2  - Tuta absoluta (tomato leafminer) is one of the devastating agricultural pest that attack mainly tomatoes. The continuous use of chemical pesticides is not affordable and poses a collateral damage to human and environmental health. This requires integrated pest management to reduce chemical pesticides. B. thuringiensis is a cosmopolitan, antagonistic soil bacterium used to control agricultural pests. In this study, effective Bt strains were screened from different sample sources based on their lepidopteran specific cry genes and larvicidal efficacy against tomato leafminer, T. absoluta under laboratory conditions. Of the 182 bacterial isolates, 55 (30 %) of isolates harbored parasporal protein crystals. Out of these, 34 (62 %) isolates possess one or more lepidopteran specific cry genes: 20 % of isolates positive for cry2, 18.2 % for cry9, 3.6 % for cry1, 16.4 % for cry2 + cry9, 1.8 % for cry1 + cry9, and 1.8 % for cry1 + cry2 + cry9. However, 21 (38.2 %) isolates did not show any lepidopteran specific cry genes. Isolates positive for cry genes showed 36.7–75 % and 46.7–98.3 % mortality against second and third instar larvae of the T. absoluta at the concentration of 108 colony forming units (CFUs) ml−1. Cry1 and cry1 plus other cry gene positive isolates were relatively more pathogenic against T. absoluta. However, third instar larvae of the T. absoluta was more susceptible than second instar larvae. Two of the isolates, AAUF6 and AAUMF9 were effective and scored LT50 values of 2.3 and 2.7 days and LC50 values of 3.4 × 103 and 4.15 × 103 CFUs ml−1 against the third instar larvae, respectively. The phylogenetic studies showed some congruence of groups with cry gene profiles and lethality level of isolates and very interestingly, we have detected a putative new phylogenetic group of Bt from Ethiopia.

N2  - The tomato had nutritional, economic and health benefits to the societies, however, its production and productivity were low in developing countries and particularly in Ethiopia. This might be due to technical inefficiency caused by institutional, governmental, and farmers related factors. Therefore this study tried to investigate the factors that affecting technical efficiency and estimating the mean level of technical efficiency of tomato producers in Asaita district, Afar Regional State, Ethiopia. Both primary and secondary data sources were used; the primary data was collected from 267 tomato producers from the study area cross-sectional by using a multistage sampling technique. The single-stage stochastic frontier model and Cobb Douglas production function were applied and statistical significance was declared at 0.05. The maximum likelihood estimates of the stochastic frontier model showed that land, labor, tomato seed, and oxen have a significant effect on tomato output; and education, extension contact, training, and access to credit have a positive and significant effect on technical efficiency, whereas household size, off-farm income, livestock ownership, distance to market, and pesticides have a worthy and significant effect on technical efficiency; and also estimated mean technical efficiency of tomato producer in a study area was 80.9%. In a line with this, the responsible body should prioritize rural infrastructure development in areas such as education, marketplace, and farmer training centers; demonstrate access to credit and extension services; use the recommended amount of pesticides per hectare, and give more intension to mixed farming rather than animal husbandry exclusively.

N2  - Pesticides play a very important role for ensuring food security and economic growth but their use can cause harmful effects to human health and to the environment. The study aimed to investigate the level of knowledge, health risk perceptions, and experiences on the practice of pesticide use and management among extension officers in Ethiopia and plant doctors in Hungary. A questionnaire survey among 326 officers was conducted in the two study areas and data were analyzed by ordinal logistic regression. According to the findings, Hungarian officers had much better knowledge of pesticide products (92%), and less frequently experienced pesticide poisoning among applicators (7%) than the Ethiopians (66% and 41%, respectively). Hungarian officers perceived less health risk of pesticide use (AOR = 0.46, 95%, Cl: 0.27–0.80), were ten times more likely to deem the pesticide management system effective (AOR = 10.23, 95%, Cl: 5.68–18.46) and were nine times more likely to report that applicators used personal protective equipment (AOR = 8.95, 95%, Cl: 4.94– 16.28). A significant proportion of officers from both countries reported inappropriate methods of pesticide residue disposal. These observations point out that the situation of pesticide use and knowledge and management of pesticide products is definitely better in Hungary; nevertheless, the issue continues to need more attention in both settings.

N2  - Background Tunga penetrans, also known as sand flea, causes Tungiasis in humans and animals. Despite its notoriety as an entomological problem, however, the ectoparasite receives little consideration from public health professionals. It is against this background that this article aims to assess the prevalence of and factors associated with Tunga penetrans infestation among 5-14-year-olds in rural Western Ethiopia. Methods From November to December 2020, 487 children aged 5 to 14 were selected from four primary schools in a cross-sectional study using systematic random sampling. Clinical exams, Interviews with parents/guardians and observations of the housing and classroom environments were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics and multivariable regression were used to characterize the data and identify factors associated with Tunga penetrans infestation. Result Tunga penetrans infestation (Tungiasis) was diagnosed in 138 of the 487 children examined, placing the prevalence at 28.3% (95% CI: 24.2%, 32.2%). Mud plastered walls [AOR: 5.83, % CI (3.44–9.88)], having cats in the house [AOR: 5.91, 95% CI (3.51–10.11)], not having separated sleeping quarters for animals [AOR: 4.60, 95% CI (2.69–7.86)], using self-supplied water [AOR: 6.30, 95% CI (3.33–11.93)], walking>30 minutes to school [AOR: 2.37, 95% CI (1.48–3.80)] were associated with Tungiasis. Conclusion In one way or another, several of the identified factors were linked to poverty. Improved house wall materials, fumigation of mud-plastered houses, dusting or spraying insecticides on domestic animals (such as cats), improved access to water, community education about keeping animals separated from living spaces, and hygiene promotion are all needed, with a focus on locally available, low-cost technologies that the poorest families can afford.

N2  - Background: Congenital anomaly is a partial or complete structural and/or functional defect during intrauterine life. Globally, major congenital anomalies account for 6% of all newborns among which about 94% of cases occurred in developing countries. In spite of its public health importance, very limited studies are reported in Ethiopia, and hardly any study in Arsi Zone. Objectives: To determine the predictors of congenital anomalies among newborns in Arsi Zone Public Hospitals, Southeast Ethiopia. Methods: A multi-center institutional-based case-control study was conducted in 418 (105 cases and 313 controls) of newborns in Arsi Zone Public Hospitals. Descriptive analysis, binary and multivariable logistic regressions were implemented. Results: In this study, women who have been drinking alcohol during pregnancy were 3.48 times more prone to have newborns with congenital anomalies than their counterparts (AOR = 3.48; 95% CI: 1.38, 8.74). The likelihood of having a newborn with congenital anomalies was six and four times higher for women who had a maternal illness (AOR = 6.10; 95%CI: 2.39, 15.57) and chewing khat during pregnancy (AOR = 4; 95%CI: 1.49, 10.65), respectively. Moreover, the lack of folic acid supplementation and pesticides during pregnancy were 3.25 and 4.76 times more likely to experience a newborn with congenital anomalies, respectively. Conclusion: Alcohol drinking, maternal illness, khat chewing, and chemical exposure during pregnancy had a significant association with the occurrence of congenital anomalies. While, taking folic acid supplements had a protective effect. Health experts and the community should take these factors into consideration and act accordingly.

N2  - Background: Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) cultivation is highly challenged by faba bean black root rot disease (Fusarium solani) in high lands of Ethiopia. To ensure sustainable production of faba beans, searching for eco-friendly disease management options is necessary to curb the progress of the disease timely. The indigenous biocontrol agents that suit local environments may effectively strive with in-situ microorganisms and suppress local pathogen strains. This study aimed to screen antagonistic indigenous compatible Trichoderma and Pseudomonas strains against Fusarium solani. In the pathogenicity test, soil-filled pots were arranged in complete random block design and sown with health faba bean seeds. The effect of some fungicides was evaluated against Fusarium by food poisoning methods to compare with the biocontrol agents. The antagonistic efficacy of biocontrol agents and their compatibility was investigated on Potato dextrose agar medium. Results: Fusarium solani AAUF51 strain caused an intense root rotting in faba bean plant. The effect of Mancozeb 80% WP at 300 ppm was comparable with Trichoderma and Pseudomonas strains against Fusarium. The mycelial growth of test the pathogen was significantly (P ≤ 0.05) reduced to 86.67 and 85.19% by Trichoderma harzianum AAUW1 and Trichoderma viridae AAUC22 strains in dual culture, respectively. The volatile metabolites of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AAUS31 (77.78%) found the most efficient in reducing mycelial growth of Fusarium followed by Pseudomonas fluorescens AAUPF62 (71.11%) strains. The cell-free culture filtrates of Pseudomonas fluorescens AAUPF62 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa AAUS31 were more efficient than the Trichoderma strain in reducing the growth of Fusarium isolates. There was no zone of inhibition recorded between Trichoderma harzianum AAUW1, Trichoderma viridae AAUC22, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AAUS31, and Pseudomonas fluorescens AAUPF62 strains, hence they were mutually compatible. Conclusions: The compatible Trichoderma and Pseudomonas strains showed antagonistic potentiality that could be explored for faba bean protection against black root rot disease and might have a future dual application as biocontrol agents.

N2  - Objective: This study aims to assess the prevalence of pesticide use and its occupational exposure among small-scale farmers in the Kellem Wellega Zone of western Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study design using a structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 249 small-scale farmers’ households through face-to-face interviews. Statistical analysis such as descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and binary logistic regression analysis was applied, and a P-value <.05 at 95% CI was considered statistically significant. Results: The prevalence of pesticide use was 87.15%. About 44.2%, 40.2%, and 43.8% of the study participants were classified as having poor knowledge, poor practice, and negative attitude toward pesticide use, respectively. Thus, small-scale farmers whose age was greater than 40 years were 7.87 times more likely to be exposed to skin irritation than those whose age was less than 20 years (AOR = 7.87; 95% CI: 1.75-35.45) and skin contact (AOR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15-0.91). Most farmers who were directly involved in agriculture were 2.22 times more likely to be exposed to the inhalation of pesticide chemicals than those involved in another activity (AOR = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.14-4.33). Based on educational level, small-scale farmers who have a primary school and above were 81% less likely to inhale pesticide chemicals than those who did not have formal education (AOR = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.09-0.41). Furthermore, low-income small-scale farmers were 2.62 times more likely to be exposed to coughing (AOR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.25-5.51) than high-income participants. Furthermore, farmers with good knowledge were 1.79 times more likely to be exposed to skin irritation than those with poor knowledge (AOR = 1.79; 95% CI: 1.0-3.17). Farmers with poor practice were 1.85 times more likely to show coughing symptoms than those with good practice (AOR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.08-3.2), and farmers with good practice were 48% less likely to be exposed to headache than those with poor practice (AOR = 0.52; 95% CI: 0.31-0.88). Conclusions: This study shows that small-scale farmers were exposed to pesticides through coughing, headache, skin irritation, inhalation, and skin contact. Low level of knowledge, poor practice, job, low income, older age, and educational level.

N2  - This study evaluated farmers’ knowledge, perceptions and insect pest management practices of maize in the northwestern part of Amhara National Regional State, Ethiopia. Data was collected by a validated questionnaire from 108 farmers. The association between the variables was assessed using Chi-square test and Ordinal Logit regression model was used to explain the association between the level of insect pest infestation on maize grain and other socio-economic factors. The results showed that pest attack was a common phenomenon and caused up to 60% grain losses. Maize weevil: Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and moths Sitotroga cerelala (Olivier) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) were identified as the most common and damaging insects. All farmers are using chemical insecticides (Actellic dust and Phostoxin) extensively to minimize the problem. It is concluded that some efforts have to take in changing in farmers’ attitude on the use of chemical pesticide and the knowledge gap identified in using cultural practices to manage maize weevil.

N2  - This review focuses on the potential effects of a desert locust infestation on Ethiopian honeybees. Data on the country's infestation, locust activity, honeybee foraging behavior, pesticide kinds, and application rates were collected and analyzed in connection to honeybee life and performance. Desert locust has damaged a considerable number of plants of various kinds, possibly causing pollen and nectar loss. As a result, honeybees are likely to produce less brood, less honey, suffer from poor health, and abscond. Besides, studies suggested that the use of pesticides to control the locust could directly harm honeybees. The pesticide was used for 21 days in a row to cover a huge region infected with locusts, which could have had a severe effect on honeybees. The probability of an influence is also indicated by the overlap of pesticide administration with honeybee foraging seasons and hours. Furthermore, forager bees leave their hive 1 to 13 times per day, spending about 3 hours outside each time, indicating higher chemical exposure. Malathion is one of the pesticides that could harm honeybees, while there is no comprehensive list of the chemicals used on the internet or anywhere else. Finally, the current desert locust invasion and eradication operation in Ethiopia may have caused substantial damage to honeybees as a result of bee forage loss and pesticide hazard, emphasizing the need for future precautions. Because this is speculative work based on evidence, detailed survey research is recommended to determine the actual impact imposed on honeybees.

N2  - Capsicum annum L. is a major vegetable crop consumed worldwide as a spice, vegetable, pickle, condiment, and sauce. Each year in Ethiopia, 80% of the yield loss of hot peppers is caused by Fusarium wilt. Controlling this disease using fungicides can pollute the environment and induce genetic resistance in fungal phytopathogens. To solve this serious problem, it is necessary to look for economically safe, long-lasting, and effective biocontrol alternatives. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate antagonistically active Trichoderma strains against F. oxysporumf.sp.capsici using a dual culture assay. The results of this study revealed that out of 32 Trichoderma isolates tested in vitro, only six (T. harzianum (TD1), T. asperellum (TD5), T. viride (TD7), T. hamatum (TD11), T. virens (TD15), and T. longibrachiatum (TD21)) strains showed a varying rate (45.72-93.57%) of biocontrol activity toward the tested pathogen. Of six isolates, three (TD5, TD1, and TD7) strains showed effective antagonists against the root pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.capsici of hot pepper (C. annum) with a colonization percentage of 89.45%, 90.12%, and 93.57%, respectively. These Trichoderma strains showed higher inhibition efficiency (> 70%) against the mycelial growth of F. oxysporum with good stress tolerance (temperature, pH, salt concentration, and heavy metals) ability. The isolates also produce different hydrolytic enzymes (amylase, protease, cellulase, and chitinase) with mycoparasitism potential against the mycelia growth of F. oxysporum. Therefore, the results of this study concluded that TD1, TD5, and TD7 Trichoderma strains showed potential biocontrol effects with wide stress tolerance ability against the root pathogen F. oxysporum of hot pepper and can thus be recommended as the best alternative for wide greenhouse and field trial evaluations.

N2  - Hadya Zone (HZ) obsolete pesticide dump site was selected for determinations of OCPs from soil and assessing the toxicological risks to environment and human health. Composite soil samples were collected and extracted using Soxhlet (SOX) extraction method and analyzed for p,p’-DDT, p,p’-DDE, p,p’-DDD, α-BHC, β-BHC, γ-BHC, δ-BHC, γ-chlordane, α-chlordane, and endosulfan sulfate using GC-MS. The total average concentrations of ΣDDTs, ΣBHCs, chlordanes, endosulfans were 41.92, 5.91, 11.47, 0.44 ng/g, respectively. DDTs, chlordanes and BHCs were categorized as causing potential risks to the eco-environment exceeding the threshold value (2.5 ng/g) set by Netherlands’ soil quality standards. However, endosulfans residual concentrations were below the threshold value. Carcinogenic risk assessments to humans were evaluated using incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCRs) via three exposure routes (ingestion, dermal contact; inhalation). The average ILCRs values were 2.54 x 10-8, 1.68 x 10-8, and 2.71 x 10-8 for the three age groups: childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, respectively. The result shows the cancer risk to humans from the soil matrix in the study site was acceptable. However, since the dumping site is at high elevation, there is high probability to be transported via runoff to different environmental matrices: river water, sediment and biota. Thus, if the residue analyses of all these environmental matrices are considered, the risk might be increasing.

N2  - The potato is an important tuberous vegetable crop. However, its production and values are constrained by various factors, including the two-spotted spider mite (TSSM) in East Hararghe, Ethiopia. An investigation of the TSSM management by the application of botanicals and synthetic insecticides was conducted in the laboratory and greenhouse. The experiment was arranged in CRD. The treatment was replicated four times in the greenhouse and five times in the laboratory. The efficacy and LC50 bioassays of Amitraz, Profenofos, and Emamectin benzoate, as well as the oils of Azadirachta indica seed and Tagetes minuta leaf, and their leaf aqueous extracts, were tested in the laboratory at three dose levels. Similarly, Amitraz, Profenofos, Emamectin benzoate (EB) and extracted oils of Azadirachta indica seed alone and in combination were tested in a greenhouse The data was collected after 24, 48, and 72 hours of their application in the laboratory. And in the greenhouse, within 7, 14, and 21 days before and after application. In the laboratory, the highest mortality of TSSM adults was recorded with EB at 80 µL (74–97%), followed by profenofos at 35 µL (71–90%). Among the botanicals, the A.indica seed oil at 5% caused the highest mortality of TSSM adults (72–100%). Amitraz also caused the highest mortality of TSSM eggs (72.5–92.5%), and it required 24.35 µL  of tap water to kill 50% of the eggs. T. minuta leaf oil had higher toxic effects on TSSM eggs (0.239%). In the greenhouse, the dose combination of Amitraz, EB, and profenofos caused higher mortality of TSSM than their sole application.

N2  - An adequate food supply is widely recognized as a necessary condition for social development as well as a basic human right. Food deficits are especially common among semi-subsistence farming households in eastern and southern Africa and farm productivity is widely regarded as the locus for enhancing household food outcomes. However, knowledge gaps surrounding benefits associated with climate smart, productivity-enhancing technologies require attention. This study evaluates benefits associated with sustainable intensification farm management practices (crop residue retention, minimum tillage, manure application and use of herbicides, pesticides, fertilizer, and improved seeds) for household calorie and protein supplies and demonstrates their scope across households with high-, moderate- and low- likelihoods of calorie and protein deficits. Household-level calorie and protein deficits were estimated from survey data on food production, acquisition and consumption for households in Ethiopia and Mozambique. Multinomial logistic models were used to identify drivers of household food deficit status and logistic model trees established “rules of thumb” to classify households by food deficit status as low, moderate or high likelihood. In Ethiopia, especially wet seasons were associated with a high likelihood of a food deficit while especially dry seasons were associated with a high likelihood of food deficit in Mozambique. The practices associated with sustainable intensification and related technologies substantially enhanced food outcomes in groups with a high- and a low-likelihood of food deficit, and associated benefits were high for the best-off households. Benefits associated with sustainable intensification technologies were not observed for households with a moderate likelihood of a food deficit and some technologies even increased risk. The sustainable intensification practices assessed here were associated with improved food outcomes yet benefits were limited in scope for households of intermediate status. Thus, there is a need to expand the technical options available to reduce food deficit.

N2  - Limited availability and access to seeds of improved varieties are often blamed for the low adoption of legume-based rotations. In this paper, we use a case study of chickpea and lentil production in Ethiopia and a gendered lens to identify other determinants of farmers’ decisions for the adoption of improved legume varieties. Mixed methods were used to collect sex and age disaggregated data through 360 household surveys, 11 focus group discussions, and 8 key informant interviews. The analysis focused on key adoption parameters, including access to land, labor, improved seed varieties, fertilizers, pesticides, agriculture information, and credit. The main challenges identified include: differential access to timely and adequate seeds of improved varieties, quality fertilizers, and pesticides; availability of credit at an affordable interest rate; and equitable access to information. As compared to men, we found women’s access to these resources to be low and women’s cost production to be relatively high. Farmland remains a main constraint for the youth. Farmers responded to the challenges by recycling seeds and mono-cropping lentils, despite declining soil and crop productivity, and increased occurrence of pests and diseases. In the case of chickpea, we found that cultural norms also discouraged the adoption of the improved variety.

N2  - Pesticides are substances that are used to kill, decrease, or repel pests and are used extensively to boost agricultural production. Ethiopian floriculture is one of the pesticide-intensive agricultural production centers and it provides jobs for 1000s of Ethiopians. Despite its significant contribution to the national economy, many issues are raised by the workers. The study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and factors associated with the practices of workers against pesticide exposure among floriculture workers in Bahirdar city. A cross-sectional occupational study was done. The participants were recruited using a stratified sample technique. The final study participants were chosen using a simple random sampling procedure. The survey received 300 responses, 95.2% response rate from the entire sample size. The mean age of floriculture workers was 20 (SD ± 3.21) years, with a range of 17 to 48 years. The majority of workers (228) were females, and 36 (12.0%) of workers were illiterate. About 259 (86.3%) of floriculture workers did not know the name of the pesticide they were using. More than three-fourth 256 (85.3%) of respondents know at least one type of pesticide-related health problem. In this study, the most known type of pesticide routes of entry into the body were eyes (72.3%), skin (67.3%) followed by ingestion (67.0%). About 100 (33.3%) of the participants had good overall knowledge related to pesticide use and 134 (44.7%) of workers had a positive attitude on safe pesticide application. The level of good practice was 61.3% (N = 184). Knowing the impact of pesticide on environment (AOR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.30-0.96), Knowing pesticide health problems, (AOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20-0.63), willingness to wear and invest for PPE (AOR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.98) and PPE supply (AOR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.51) were significantly associated with workers pesticide handling practices. Workers who didn’t know pesticide health problems were 36% less likely to have a good practice. The likelihood of having good practices among works who disagree to wear and invest on PPE 53% lower than those who agree on it. The likelihood of having good practices among workers who didn’t have any PPE supply was lower than their counterparts with (AOR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.51). Floriculture workers had poor handling practices therefore continuous pesticide training programs for workers could be implemented.

N2  - Coffee is a major export commodity and a source of foreign currency for Ethiopia. Smallholder coffee growers are dominant in the Bale Zone and poor handling practice leads to contamination of coffee by postharvest fungi. Therefore, the current study aim is to evaluate antifungal activity of plant extracts against postharvest fungi associated to coffee in Bale Zone, Ethiopia. A survey was conducted in three districts of Bale Zone: Berbere, Delo Mena, and Harena Buluk during 2017/2018. About 120 coffee samples were collected from three drying methods and two storage materials. In vitro antifungal activities were laid out in factorial completely randomized design with the combination of five plant materials and positive control, five fungal species, and three concentrations with three replications. The survey result revealed that the participants were performing dry processing and used both sisal sacks and fertilizer bags as packing materials. Coffee dried on cement had the highest fungal contamination (98.4%), followed by a plastic sheet (81.8%) and bed (61.0%). The samples obtained from fertilizer bags had higher fungal incidence (81.8%) than regular sacks (63.3%). Fungal species such as Aspergillus niger (79.1%), Aspergillus flavus (4.2%), Aspergillus ochraceus (1.9%), Fusarium spp. (12.5%), and Penicillium spp. (2.5%) were isolated from coffee cherries. Solanum nigrum has shown high inhibition of mycelial growth of tested fungi except for Aspergillus ochraceus and Fusarium spp. Plant extracts can be used as natural fungicide to control the growth of postharvest mould fungi and thus reduce the dependence on synthetic fungicides. Therefore, proper drying practices and a good storage system were found to be crucial in maintaining the postharvest fungal reduction associated with coffee cherries; and plant extracts had antimicrobial compounds that inhibited the tested pathogens.

N2  - Propolis is a natural resin substance produced by honeybees by collecting from parts of plants, buds, and exudates that are used for several biological activities such as antimicrobial, and fungicide functions. This study aimed to analyze the phytochemical, physicochemical, and antimicrobial activity of propolis collected from Boji Dirmaji and Fincha'a districts of western Ethiopia. The physicochemical characteristics, phytochemical screening, and antimicrobial activity of Ethiopian propolis against Aspergillus niger, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated using the disk diffusion method from its essential oils and crude ethanol extract were evaluated based on standard procedures. The results indicated that propolis was rich in saponins, tannins, flavonoids, steroids, triterpenes, and glycosides. Physicochemically, n-hexane extractable substances ranged between 8.6 and 33.9%, resins soluble 14.8–16.8%, insoluble residues 70.8–85.5%, moisture 1.7–4.6%, and ash content 2.8–9.7%, and 4.8 pH. The antimicrobial activities of essential oils propolis were active against Escherichia coli with an average inhibition zone of 18.3 ± 0.52 mm and 18.9 ± 0.06 mm at concentrations of 10 and 20 μl in Dirmaji districts. Moreover, the crude ethanol extracted propolis had nearly the same effect of inhibition to Escherichia coli. However, both crude extract and its essential oils didn't show any activity on Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus niger. The analyzed propolis is promising antimicrobial activity from Gram-negative which is very notorious for people of the world.

N2  - This study was initiated to analyze smallholder farmers’ vulnerability to climate change-induced shocks and identify the adaptation strategies they practice. The study was conducted in the North Wollo and Wag Hemra zones of the Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. It employed both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection. The zones and districts were selected purposively based on the frequency of shocks and the sample Kebeles1 and sample respondents were selected randomly. Quantitative data were collected using a household survey, whereas qualitative data were collected via focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observations. While the quantitative data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, the qualitative data were transcribed, coded, organized thematically based on these similarities, and interpreted thematically. The results show that the major climate change-induced shocks in the area were increase in temperature and changes in rainfall-related variables, such as shifts in rainy periods, shortages of rain, and variability of rainfall. In addition, droughts, crop and livestock pests and diseases, and pasture and water scarcity are all widespread in the area. As a result, land degradation and reduced crop and livestock output were identified as the primary impacts due to climate change-induced shocks on smallholder livelihoods. The findings demonstrate that households and communities are extremely vulnerable to climate change-related shocks. To reduce their vulnerability to climate change, smallholder farmers in the area used both autonomous and policy-driven climate change adaptation strategies, such as soil and water conservation practices, haystack preparation, improved crop varieties, fertilizer, pesticide, and herbicide application. Nonetheless, smallholder farmers' vulnerability to climate change-induced shocks persists, owing to the limitations in the implementation of existing adaptation strategies in the area. Limited access to finance, information, and technologies have all been an obstacle in the sector, preventing comprehensive adaptation to climate change. As a result, smallholder farmers' capacity to adopt both autonomous and policy-driven climate change adaptation strategies must be strengthened. Hence use of improved crop and livestock varieties, application of good agricultural practices, construction of micro-and small-scale irrigation structures, and provision of well-coordinated early warning systems are examples of adaptation strategies that could be implemented to reduce vulnerability to climate change-induced shocks and increase farmers' adaptive capacity.

N2  - The growth and development of the spices sector depend upon market-oriented production system and good marketing infrastructure. However, for smallholder farmers, it is difficult to supply theirs produces to markets because of different problems and barriers. Therefore, this study was aimed at analyzing the push and pulls factors of red pepper market supply in Southwest Ethiopia. The primary data were collected from 267 randomly selected sample households’. The Tobit model was used to determine the volume of red pepper supplied to the market. The results shows that the education level of household head, land allocated for red pepper production, access to credit, and lagged price of red pepper significantly affect the volume of red pepper supplied to the market. The major production constraints that hamper red pepper yield were red pepper disease, lack of fertilizer supply, lack of improved variety, lack of pesticide, harvesting before maturity, and poor post-harvest handling. The marketing constraints were lack of marketplace, low and unstable price of the product, and low quality of product, improper scale, lack of government support, and lack of transport. Therefore, Policies that give more emphasis on the provision of modern inputs, improving infrastructure, strengthening institutions of collective action, and improving the marketing extension system are recommended.

N2  - Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the leading cause of health concerns among Ethiopian migrant workers. Understanding risk perception and health-protective behavior are significant challenges in the prevention and eradication of the disease. As a result, studies are required to assess these important epidemiological factors, which will provide guidance on how to assist migrant workers in taking preventive measures against VL. Method: We conducted qualitative research among migrant workers on seasonal agricultural farms in Northwest Ethiopia between June and November 2019 to assess their perception of the risk of contracting VL and their willingness to use protective measures against the disease. Seventeen focus group discussions and 16 key informant interviews were conducted to study migrant workers’ risk perception in relation to sandfly bite exposure and use of sandfly control measures. For analysis, all interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated. ATLASti was used to perform qualitative content analysis on the data. Result: Migrant workers are fearful of VL because of previous exposure and the disease’s prevalence in the area. They believe, however, that VL is a minor illness that is easily treated. While Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) are widely accepted as a protective measure, there are still reservations about using them due to the seasonality of the transmission, difficulties in hanging them on farm areas, and a preference for alternative traditional practices. Regardless of perceived self-efficacy, the central cues were the message delivered by the health workers and an increase in sandfly bite irritation. Based on the findings, three levels of intervention modalities are suggested: 1) increasing pre-arrival awareness through outdoor media (posters, stickers, billboards), 2) encouraging proper use of protective measures upon arrival at farm camps, and 3) informing departing workers on disease recognition and best practices for health-seeking continuous use of protective measures at home. Conclusion: This finding suggests that VL prevention interventions should focus on individuals’ perceptions in order to promote consistent use of protective measures. The findings are highly useful in planning effective interventions against VL.

N2  - In this study, the residual concentrations of some organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides were determined in tomato, potato, and pineapple samples from selected farmlands of Jimma and Kefa Zones, Southwest of Ethiopia. The QuEChERS procedure, AOAC-2007, was used for extraction of the pesticides from the samples prior to their determinations by a gas GC-ECD. Pesticides including dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, endrin, and dieldrin were not detected in all studied samples. Dimethoate was detected only in Mana and Saka Buyo Qacama tomato samples. Likewise, malathion was detected only in the Saka Buyo Qacama tomato sample. The residual concentrations of most of the studied pesticides were below their MRLs set in EU guideline. However, the recorded residual concentrations of dibutyl chlorendate and chloroflurenol-methyl pesticides were above the EU general default MRL. The percent recoveries studied by spiking known concentrations of the analytes ranged from 71.22-121.56%. However, the recoveries of chloroflurenol-methyl and chlorpyrifos in the potato sample were 65.65 and 67.90%, respectively. One-way ANOVA results (p ≤ 0.05) indicated the presence of significant variations in the concentrations of the detected pesticides among the sampling sites. Generally, the findings showed that regular monitoring of pesticide residues in agricultural products of the area is needed.

N2  - Intensive pesticide use increased concern about the potential acute and chronic health effects of pesticides in general and among applicators in particular. This study aims to explore occupational and environmental pesticide exposure and health risks among pesticide applicators and residents. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted involving 1,073 individuals. We examined the health effects potentially attributable to pesticide exposure using regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PR). A higher proportion of good knowledge of pesticides [75 vs. 14%; APR = 1.542 (1.358–1.752), p < 0.001] and a higher mean score of perceived health risk of pesticide use [4.21 vs. 3.90; APR = 1.079 (1.004–1.159), p < 0.05] were observed among applicators than residents. A significantly higher proportion of applicators experienced health effects presumably related to pesticide exposure among themselves (36%) than residents (16%), and a higher proportion of them used prescribed drugs in the past 12 months [51 vs. 32%; APR = 1.140 (1.003–1.295), p < 0.05]. Skin irritation, shortness of breath, cough, and dizziness were more likely reported by applicators than residents. Perceived toxicity of currently applied pesticide products, mix pesticides without gloves, regularly maintain and wash sprayer tank after application, occurrence of an incidental splash during mixing and application, and using home-based care after experiencing a symptom presumably due to pesticide exposure were significantly associated with health effects among applicators. Use of face mask and visiting health facility when experiencing a symptom presumably due to pesticide exposure were significantly positively correlated with attending training on the health risks and use of pesticides. A substantial proportion of applicators reported improper use of preventive measures and methods of pesticide waste disposal. These observations point out that applicators can face high health risks of occupational pesticide exposure in Ethiopia. Even trained applicators pursued poor preventive practices; hence, comprehensive practice-oriented in-depth training focusing on safety precautions and proper use of personal protective equipment, and provision of adequate pesticide waste disposal means are crucial interventions.

N2  - Sesame is an important oil crop for the Ethiopian economy. However, the lack of adequate storage facilities results in significant losses of sesame seeds. This study was designed to compare the effects of storage conditions and the subsequent impact on sesame seed germination, mold growth, and mycotoxin accumulation over the storage period. The efficacy of two hermetic bags (1. Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags and 2. Super GrainPro (SGP) bags) was directly compared to sesame storage in polypropylene (PP bags) and Jute bags. Storage conditions (oxygen, carbon dioxide, temperature, moisture content and relative humidity) of samples were analyzed in the laboratory in three replicates. Results showed that the oxygen concentrations dropped to 6.9% (±0.02) in PICS bags and 8.7% (±0.06) in SGP bags at the end of 6 months of storage. In non-hermetic bags Jute and PP), oxygen levels were close to atmospheric levels at 2-, 4-, and 6-month storage periods. In non-hermetic bags throughout storage, the amount of seed infection by mold constantly increased, and seed germination decreased. Sesame seeds stored in hermetic bags had 89.7% (±0.58) to 88.3% (±2.89) germination rates versus 61.67% (±2.08) for non-hermetic storage bags over the 6-month seed storage period. All mycotoxin levels increased over the same storage period, whereas comparative levels were much lower in hermetic bags after six months. Sesame seeds stored in both hermetic bags had the lowest level of tested mycotoxins, and levels among the SGP and PICS bags were not significantly different from one another. This study provides strong evidence indicating that hermetic storage structures such as PICS and SGP significantly affect temperature, humidity, moisture content, CO2 and oxygen levels resulting in the lowering of fungal growth and mycotoxin accumulation and effectively preserving stored sesame without relying on synthetic pesticides in Ethiopia.

N2  - Pesticide registration in developing countries like Ethiopia is often not supported by substantiated risk assessment procedures. In this study, we evaluated the PRIMET (Pesticide Risks in the Tropics for Man, Environment and Trade) Registration_Ethiopia_1.1 model which is a tool developed to assess the risks to non-target protection goals. All the 103 registered active ingredients (a.i.) in Ethiopia, except those used for flower and storage pest control purposes, were evaluated on their environmental risks. Data on physico-chemical characteristics, toxicity and pesticide use patterns were mined from either the information given in the dossier or public databases. Together with scenarios specifically developed for Ethiopia, these data were used to perform a risk assessment for the aquatic and terrestrial environment as well as for vertebrates including humans via contaminated drinking water exposure. Results indicated that 11 and 16% of the a.i.s are indicated to pose high acute risk and 7.3 and 11% high chronic risks for fish and aquatic invertebrates, respectively. Similarly, 5.5 and 8.7% high acute risks and 6.8 and 3.9% high chronic risks were observed for the soil ecosystem and birds, respectively. 23% of the evaluated active ingredients were indicated to be highly risky to bees when beehives are present inside the sprayed crop while 7.8% of them are highly risky when beehives are present outside the field of the sprayed crop. The fungicide metalaxyl, the herbicides acetochlor, alachlor, mecoprop and tembotrion, and the insecticides carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, diazinon and methidathion were predicted to pose high acute or chronic risks to humans or other vertebrates if surface water is used as a source of drinking water. Future studies should give emphasis on how the risk assessment results of this study can be implemented to aid the registration process.

N2  - Background: Chronic undernutrition (stunting) among children is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. The global community is committed to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030. Regardless of this, children are suffering from some form of malnutrition but the reason is unclear. This study thus was intended to identify stunting and associated factors among children aged 6 to 59 months in the South Ari Woreda of South Omo Zone. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in South Ari Woreda from 1, January 2022 to 30, February 2022, and 409 children participated. A simple random sampling technique was used to identify study participants, and mothers/caregivers were interviewed. Data on sociodemographic, economic, and environmental determinants were collected by trained professional nurses using interviewer-administered questionnaires and anthropometric data were collected via weighting and measuring the height/length of the child. Emergency Nutrition Assessment for Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transitions 2020 software was used to generate an anthropometric index, and a child with a height for age index below −2standard deviations of the standard population was considered stunted. Factors of stunting were assessed using multivariate binary logistic regression at a 5% significance level. Results: The study revealed that 44.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 39.19%-48.81%) of children were stunted in the study area. Household's wealth status (the poorest; adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.14 [95% CI = 2.08-8.22] and poor; AOR = 3.31 [95% CI = 1.60-6.82]), improper solid waste management practice of the household (AOR = 2.67 [95% CI = 1.56-4.55]), and the children sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets (ITN) (AOR = 0.37 [95%CI = 0.22-0.60]) were statistically significantly associated with stunting status of the children. Conclusion: Stunting among the children in the study area was very high. Improving household's (HH) economy, safe management of domestic solid waste, and ensuring that the children are sleeping under ITNs are expected to reduce stunting.

N2  - The extensive use of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) pesticide leads to the contamination of surfaces and groundwater. In this respect, it is critical to develop an inexpensive and environmentally friendly adsorbent for 2,4-D-laden agricultural leachate. In the current study, termite mound soil (TMS) from Ethiopia was used as an adsorbent in a batch mode aimed at the removal of 2,4-D from an aqueous solution. The TMS was characterized using Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The effects of various operating parameters such as pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, and initial concentration were investigated. In addition, the optimization process and interaction effect were studied using response surface methodology (RSM). A high 2,4-D removal percentage (89.6%) was achieved for a 2,4-D initial concentration of 50.25 mg/L at pH 2, an adsorbent dose of 15.25 g/L, and a contact time of 180.5 min. The 2,4-D adsorption isotherms could be adequately described by the Langmuir model (R2 = 0.9687), while the kinetics of the 2,4-D adsorption on the TMS best fit the pseudo-second-order model. Overall the study showed that TMS is an effective adsorbent for the removal of 2,4-D from agricultural leachate.

N2  - Chemical pesticides, regardless of their inherent hazard, are used intensively in the fast changing agricultural sector of Ethiopia. We conducted a cross-sectional pesticide Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) survey among 601 farmers and farm workers (applicators and re-entry workers) in three farming systems [large-scale closed greenhouses (LSGH), large-scale open farms (LSOF), and small-scale irrigated farms (SSIF)]. Main observations were that 85% of workers did not attain any pesticide-related training, 81% were not aware of modern alternatives for chemical pesticides, 10% used a full set of personal protective equipment, and 62% did not usually bath or shower after work. Among applicators pesticide training attendance was highest in LSGH (35%) and was lowest in SSIF (4%). None of the female re-entry farm workers had received pesticide-related training. Personal protective equipment use was twice as high among pesticide applicators as among re-entry workers (13 versus 7%), while none of the small-scale farm workers used personal protection equipment. Stockpiling and burial of empty pesticide containers and discarding empty pesticide containers in farming fields were reported in both LSOF and by 75% of the farm workers in SSIF. Considerable increment in chemical pesticide usage intensity, illegitimate usages of DDT and Endosulfan on food crops and direct import of pesticides without the formal Ethiopian registration process were also indicated. These results point out a general lack of training and knowledge regarding the safe use of pesticides in all farming systems but especially among small-scale farmers. This in combination with the increase in chemical pesticide usage in the past decade likely results in occupational and environmental health risks. Improved KAP that account for institutional difference among various farming systems and enforcement of regulatory measures including the available occupational and environmental proclamations in Ethiopia are urgently needed.

N2  - In the Pesticide Risk Reduction Programme Ethiopia the evaluation of risks of pesticides present in drinking water for man and cattle was selected as a priority protection goal. In cooperation with the Plant Health Regulatory Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of Ethiopia and other Ethiopian stakeholders Alterra developed a procedure to assess the risks for drinking water caused by pesticides, used according to Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). To do so, 'realistic worst case' scenarios were developed, that intend to protect man and cattle in 99% of all possible situations in Ethiopia. For groundwater three scenarios representing wells in aquifers in the Ethiopian highlands or Rift Valley margins were developed and for surface water three scenarios representing small rivers in the highlands or temporary stagnant ponds were developed. The scenarios were linked to crops on which pesticides are used that score high on acute, chronic or local chronic risk for man. In addition other agro-environmental conditions were defined, such as precipitation, soil, and land use management. The groundwater scenarios were parameterised in the EuroPEARL metamodel to calculate leaching concentrations to groundwater, whereas the surface water scenarios make use of the runoff model PRZM, the EU-FOCUS spray drift deposition table and the surface water model TOXSWA to calculate the concentration in the small river or pond scenarios. The concentration calculations use 33 years of meteorological data for the selected scenario sites of both groundwater and surface water. Example calculations for seven high risk compounds (dimethoate, endosulfan, deltamethrin, 2,4-D, malathion, atrazine and chlorothalonil) on e.g. barley, wheat, teff, maize, cotton, potatoes (Irish and sweet) and faba beans indicated that for the considered application schemes risks exist for drinking water produced from groundwater for atrazine. For surface water no acute toxicity risks exist, but for dimethoate used on barley and faba beans chronic toxicity risks exist.

N2  - Background: Poor air quality of the household is likely to be the largest public health concern in resource-constrained countries. Exposure to household air pollution, poor working environment, and fuel type used at household level have been associated with respiratory symptoms. This study aimed to assess acute respiratory symptoms and its associated factors among mothers who have under five-years-old children in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out from February 15, 2019 to June 20, 2019. Study participants were selected using simple random sampling, and data were collected via face-to-face interviews. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to test the association of explanatory and outcome variables. Variables with p < 0.05 were considered as significantly associated with the outcome variable. Results: The prevalence of respiratory symptoms among mothers of under-five years-old children in this study was 46.1%. Education (vocational training compared to cannot read and write) (adjusted odd ratio (AOR) = 0.26 at 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.08-0.82), working in dusty environment (AOR = 2.90 at 95% CI: 1.39-6.08), wood fire use (AOR = 0.37 at 95% CI: 0.16-0.85), living in mud- and wood-walled houses (AOR = 0.53 at CI: 0.32-0.89), recent house painting (AOR = 1.95 at 95% CI: 1.03-3.69), new carpet (AOR = 2.02 at 95% CI: 1.08-3.77), pesticide use (AOR = 1.71 at 95% CI: 1.03-2.84), damp stain (AOR = 2.45 at 95% CI: 1.04-5.75), spending longer time in house for 6 to 11 h (AOR = 2.59 at 95% CI: 1.53-4.37) and 11 to 15 h (AOR = 3.47 at 95% CI: 1.87-6.43), and living less than 100 m from unpaved roads/streets (AOR = 4.35 at 95% CI: 2.64-7.18) were significantly associated with respiratory symptoms among mothers of under-five years-old children. Conclusion: Respiratory symptoms were common among mothers who have under five-years-old children. Air quality improvement, fuel selection, and residential planning will help to reduce respiratory symptoms.

N2  - To promote pesticide governance that protects the environment and human health, Ethiopia has developed a legal framework for pesticide registration and control. However, in Ethiopia, pesticides are still registered, traded and used inappropriately. This research analyses how Ethiopia's pesticide policy is implemented and identifies the barriers for an effective implementation of this policy. With a theoretical framework based on the information, motivations and resources of relevant actors, data are collected from state pesticide experts, traders and end users (farmers) through in-depth interviews. The overall result reveals that major gaps exist between pesticides policy on paper and its implementation in practice. The key policy actors scored low on each of the three characteristics: they have poor information available, have low motivation to implement policies and lack sufficient resources. Involvement of and collaboration with private actors is likely to improve the implementation of pesticide governance, and contribute to sustainability in agricultural and food systems in Ethiopia.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Farmers in developing countries, including Ethiopia, are exposed to agricultural pesticides, including pesticides that are restricted or banned in developed countries. There is little information available on pesticide use safety practices and associated factors among Ethiopian farmers, particularly in the study area. OBJECTIVE: To assess pesticide use safety practices and associated factors among farmers in Fogera district wetland area, Amhara region, Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design that employs quantitative and qualitative methods was used from August 25 to September 30, 2021. Four hundred thirty participants were included by using a stratified random sampling technique. Pre-tested interview questionnaires, observational checklists, and key informant and in-depth interview guides were used to collect data. The quantitative data were collected by face-to-face interviews of farmers, whereas the qualitative data were collected by in-depth interviews of selected farmers and key informant interviews of responsible stalk holders. The data were entered into Epi data version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Bi-variable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the dependent variable. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used as a cut-off point to declare a statistically significant association between factors and outcome variables. The odds ratio and 95% CI were calculated to describe the strength of the association between factors and outcome variables. The qualitative study included 35 respondents from various backgrounds and levels of expertise, which were analyzed using thematic analysis by open-code 4.03 version software. RESULT: The proportion of good pesticide use safety practices in the study area was 24.4% (95% CI: 21.4%-29.3%). Educational status (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.19, 95% CI: 1.44-6.71), experience of pesticide spraying (AOR: 6.85. 95% CI: 2.426-9.35), knowledge of pesticide usage (AOR: 3.40, 95% CI: 1.459-7.855), access to safety materials (AOR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.198-3.536), and ever having received training (AOR: 4.93, 95% CI: 2.88-8.59) were factors associated with good safety practice in pesticide use. Qualitatively, limited material access, lack of government attention, insufficient training opportunities, absence of media coverage, weak enforcement of laws, and limited guideline access barred good safety practices for pesticide use. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that good safety practices were low in the study area. Being educated, having experience with pesticide spraying, having good knowledge of pesticide usage, having access to safety materials, and having received pesticide use training all increased the likelihood of good pesticide use practice. Insufficient training opportunities and material access, weak law enforcement, limited access to guidelines, and a shortage of media coverage were challenges identified qualitatively.

N2  - Lake Ziway, a freshwater lake located in Ethiopia, is under the pressure of pesticide and nutrient pollution due to agricultural activity and urbanization. This study has analysed concentrations of insecticides, fungicides and nutrients in water and sediment samples of Lake Ziway taken in the wet and dry season at 13 sites expected to be under different environmental stress and assessed their expected ecological impacts. Malathion, dimethoate, metalaxyl, diazinon, chlorpyrifos, fenitrothion and endosulfan were detected in more than half of the water samples, while diazinon, α-cypermethrin and endosulfan were frequently detected (>25%) in sediment samples. Higher levels of physicochemical parameters were observed at sample locations proximate to agricultural and urban activities. Risk quotients (RQ) and multi-substance Potentially Affected Fraction (msPAFRA) were calculated to assess the ecological risk of individual and mixture of pesticides, respectively. The majority of the pesticides detected in the water of the lake showed a potential acute risk (RQ > 1), specifically the insecticides chlorpyrifos, λ-cyhalothrin and α-cypermethrin for which high potential acute risks were calculated using a 2nd tier risk assessment. Levels of pesticides in sediment showed low ecological risks. Arthropods and fishes are expected to be highly affected by mixtures of pesticides (msPAFRA = < 1–80%) detected at locations that are proximate to smallholders’ farms, and receive largescale farms’ wastewater and at sites where inflow rivers join the lake. Macroinvertebrates based redundancy analysis showed the effectiveness of EPT richness to assess ecological status of the lake. Training for smallholder farmers on pesticides safety and usage, and implementation of improved effluent management mechanisms by floriculture farms are urgently needed intervention measures to reduce the pollution.

N2  - Since Ethiopia is going through a rapid transformation of its agricultural sector, we assessed the human health and environmental risks due to the past use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) as well as the risks of the current pesticide use by farmers. A monitoring programme and risk assessment was carried out for the Wedecha-Belbela irrigation system in the Debra Zeit area. The Wedecha and Belbela rivers and adjacent temporary ponds were sampled and examined for the presence of OCPs between August and October 2014, while data on the current pesticide use by small- and large-scale farmers was collected by interviews. The usage patterns were evaluated for risks of using the river or temporary ponds as source of drinking water and for risks for the aquatic ecosystems in the river and ponds with the aid of the PRIMET_Registration_Ethiopa_1.1 model. The samples were collected in five sampling periods, and results indicate that most of the 18 target OCPs were not detected above the detection limit, while g-chlordane may pose chronic risks when surface water is used as drinking water. Endosulfan and heptachlor pose risks to aquatic organisms at second-tier level, while for heptachlor-epoxide B, g-chlordane and b-BHC only risks could be determined at the first tier due to a lack of data. For all nine pesticides used by small-scale farmers the calculated acute risks to humans were low. Second tier risk assessment for the aquatic ecosystem indicated that lambda-cyhalothrin, endosulfan, profenofos, and diazinon may pose high risks.

N2  - Ethiopia and South Africa are among the few countries to still implement indoor residual spraying with dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) for malaria vector control. In this study, we investigated the levels and ecological risks of DDT and its metabolites in liver tissues of house rat, as a sentinel animal, for providing an early warning system for public health and wildlife intervention from Ethiopia and South Africa. The results showed that ΣDDT concentration ranged from 127 to 9155 μg/kg wet weight, and the distribution order of DDT and its metabolites in the analyzed liver samples was p,p′-DDD > p,p′-DDE >> p,p′-DDT, o,p′-DDT, and o,p′-DDD. The risk assessment indicated a potential adverse impact on humans, especially for pregnant women and children, because they spend majority of their time in a DDT-sprayed house. The ecological assessment also showed a concern for birds of prey and amphibians like frogs. This study is the first report on DDT contamination in liver tissues of house rats from Ethiopia and South Africa, and henceforth, the data will serve as a reference data for future studies.

N2  - Pesticides are widely used for safeguarding agricultural yields and controlling malaria vectors, yet are simultaneously unintentionally introduced in aquatic environments. To assess the severity of this pressure in the Lake Tana Basin (Ethiopia), we evaluated the occurrence of 17 pesticide residues in the lake, tributary rivers, and associated wetlands during the wet and dry season, followed by a questionnaire. These questionnaires indicated that 35 different compounds were available in the districts surrounding the lake, including pesticides that are banned in Europe, i.e., endosulfan, dicofol, and malathion. Nevertheless, only 7 pesticide residues were detected in the assessed aquatic habitats. Of these, DDE and bifenthrin occurred most often (97.7% and 62.3%, respectively), while alachlor displayed the highest mean concentration (594 ± 468 ng/L). No significant differences were observed in residue concentrations between seasons nor between habitats. Based on an ecotoxicological risk assessment, the observed concentrations of DDE and cypermethrin pose a high risk to aquatic life, while alachlor and DDT-op residues were below the threshold values. Furthermore, a human risk assessment indicated a low risk for the population that directly consumes water from the Tana basin, while acknowledging the potential of indirect exposure through the consumption of fish and locally grown crops.

N2  - This paper studies the practice of synthetic chemical use among farmers and its possible occurrence as residue in fish foods in North-West Ethiopia. Cross-sectional study design was carried out from January to December 2018. A multi-stage sampling technique embedded with simple random sampling was employed for the selection of sampling units. The data were collected through in-depth interviews and observations of farmers. Data entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 20. The results showed that farmers applied chemicals indiscriminately and inappropriately on their farm, using unsafe storage facilities, ignoring risks and safety instructions. Consequently, farmers respond that insecticides and herbicides were used up to 100% and 96.4% of their farms, respectively. Most of the farmers (80.16%) of the study area have poor attitudes and practices of pesticide usage. Multivariable analysis showed, illiterate educational level; Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] = 3.39; 95% CI: 1.7, 6.77; Land holders situation (AOR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.52, 2.9) has been formally not trained about pesticides usage (AOR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.06, 8.37) and not read pesticide labels (AOR = 3.69, 95%CI: 1.62, 13.64) were significantly associated with possible poor attitude and practice of pesticide contamination. We conclude that there are high possibilities of chemical residues affects fish and occurring in food products (in milk, meat, fish, vegetable and fruit) that may have a public health risk in the study area. Therefore, one health intervention is required.

N2  - In this study, pesticide practices and related environmental and health effects were investigated in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia through a farmers’ survey. Questionnaires were distributed to 422 local farmers in the Arsi-Negele, Meki and Ziway areas. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the results of the questionnaire and to identify risk factors associated with environmental and health effects after spraying. The majority of the farmers (44.4–55.0%) stored their pesticides in the kitchen or anywhere in the house, while only 6.5–32.0% of the farmers stored them in a separate place outside the house. A large majority of the farmers (63%) did not use personal protective equipment during pesticide spraying and handling, which was negatively associated with understanding pesticide instructions of the pesticide labels, OR: 0.9; (95% CI:0.82–0.98) in the supervised stepwise backwards selection model. Reading the instructions of the pesticide labels was positively associated with understanding instructions OR: 1.59 (95% CI: 1.0–2.54). The risk for water pollution was higher in the Meki region OR: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.14–1.4) compared to Ziway and Arsi-Negele. Most farmers (66%) experienced discomfort after pesticide spraying and Illnesses from pesticide spraying were more frequently reported by educated farmers. Therefore, proper training in pesticide use in this region could strongly reduce the health risk associated with pesticide exposure.

N2  - Background. Inappropriate use and application of pesticides in Ethiopia pose a major threat to the health of farmers and the environment. Objective. The present study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices of small-scale vegetable farmers towards the use of pesticides in Ethiopia along the Lake Ziway watershed. Methods. This was a cross-sectional study involving a total of 210 farmers randomly selected during a period of pesticide application from a purposively selected village located in the immediate vicinity of Lake Ziway, Ethiopia. Data were generated through structured in-depth interviews and on-site observations on farms. A Chi-square test was applied to evaluate whether the collected data and their probable associations were significant. Results. World Health Organization (WHO) class II pesticides (moderately toxic) were the most frequently used pesticides in the study area. There was no reported use of WHO classes 1a and 1b and banned or restricted pesticides such as dichloro diphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and endosulfan. Most (92%) farmers reported indiscriminately disposing of empty containers in the field, while 86.7% applied the leftover pesticides to other crops. More than 90% of small-scale farmers did not use any personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling pesticides. About 95% of farmers had poor knowledge regarding pesticides. A significant association (p < 0.001) was observed between the knowledge of farmers and their practices related to pesticides. Conclusions. Generally, the knowledge of small-scale farmers on pesticides was poor. Moreover, the inappropriate disposal of pesticides and pesticide containers poses a risk to the environment. The findings of the present study underline the need to train farmers concerning the safe and proper use of pesticides to mitigate hazards to human health and the environment. Participant Consent.

N2  - The area around Lake Ziway in Ethiopia is going through a major agricultural transformation with both small-scale farmers and large horticultural companies using pesticides and fertilisers at an increased rate. To be able to understand how this influences the water quality of Lake Ziway, water quality data was gathered to study the dynamics of pesticide concentrations and physicochemical parameters for the years from 2009 to 2015. Results indicate that for some physicochemical parameters, including pH, potassium and iron, over 50 % of the values were above the maximum permissible limit of the Ethiopian standard for drinking water. The fungicide spiroxamine poses a high chronic risk when the water is used for drinking water, while the estimated intake of diazinon was approximately 50 % of the acceptable daily intake. Higher-tier risk assessment indicated that the fungicide spiroxamine poses a high acute risk to aquatic organisms, while possible acute risks were indicated for the insecticides deltamethrin and endosulfan. Longer-term monitoring needs to be established to show the water quality changes across time and space, and the current study can be used as a baseline measurement for further research in the area as well as an example for other surface water systems in Ethiopia and Africa.

N2  - The current status of persistent organic pollutants in Ethiopian environment is not well monitored despite the existing pollution potential from a number of sources. Water and sediment samples collected from Akaki River catchment and Aba Samuel Reservoir, Central Ethiopia were analyzed to assess the concentrations, distribution, possible sources and potential ecological risk of eight organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and seven polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Water and sediment samples were extracted by liquid-liquid and Soxhlet extraction respectively, and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). The detectable OCPs and PCBs in water samples were DDT, DDE, DDD, lindane and dieldrin and PCB-28, PCB-101 and PCB-118, respectively in the rainy season. Analyzed sediment samples showed the presence of lindane in the dry and p, p’-DDT, p, p’-DDE, p, p’-DDD, α, β-endosulfan, heptachlor epoxide (B), and dieldrin in the rainy seasons. Among the indicator PCBs analyzed, sediment samples showed the presence of PCB-52, PCB-101 and PCB-118 in the dry and all indicator PCBs in the rainy seasons. Sources analysis showed that PCBs and detected OCPs were mainly from the historical input of commercial products, but there were recent discharge of DDT and lindane into the river system. Ecological risk assessment of the analyzed OCPs and PCBs using water and sediment quality guidelines indicated that lindane in the dry and p’-DDT, p, p’-DDE, p, p’-DDD, heptachlore epoxide and dieldrin in the rainy seasons in the sediment samples from Akaki river and Aba Samuel reservoir were above the limit at most of the sites. This suggests there is greater possibility of higher ecological hazards in these residues. However, the levels of total PCB concentrations and other OCPs at all sites were below the limit and thus their potential ecotoxicological risks were rather low.

N2  - Access to safe and reliable drinking water is vital for a healthy population. However, surface water may be contaminated with pesticides because of the nearby agricultural areas as well as from household application. Water samples were collected from water sources in Jimma zone and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The extraction and clean up of the samples were undertaken using liquid-solid and liquid-liquid methods. Human exposure was assessed by calculating the estimated daily intake (EDI) of pesticides in water and compared with the acceptable daily intake (ADI) and the acute reference dose (ARfD). The mean concentrations of 2,4-D, malathion, diazinon and fenpropimorph were 1.59-13.90 μg/l and 0.11-138 µg/l in Jimma and Addis Ababa water sources, respectively. The residue level of some of the pesticides were above the European drinking water guide line values, which is an indication of an illegal use of pesticides in the study areas. Concerning human health risk estimation, there was no acute risk (EDI < ARfD). However, chronic risks to human health were observed from exposure to diazinon and fenpropimorph (EDI > ADI) for Jimma and Addis Ababa populations, respectively. A comprehensive monitoring is required to reduce the level of pesticide residues in the water and to minimize particularly the long term human health risks.
